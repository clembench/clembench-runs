	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a bathroom.\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.
