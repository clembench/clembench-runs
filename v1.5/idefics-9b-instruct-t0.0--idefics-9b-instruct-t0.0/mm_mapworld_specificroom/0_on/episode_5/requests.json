The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: \"{\"description\": \"<room description>\", \"action\": \"<action>\"}\". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with \"GO: DIRECTION\" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with \"DONE\" instead.
