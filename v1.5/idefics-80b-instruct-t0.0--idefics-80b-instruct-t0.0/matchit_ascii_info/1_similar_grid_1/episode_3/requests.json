There are 4 Xs in the grid, 2 of which are in the same row. There are 2 empty squares in the grid, both of which are in the same column. There are 4 squares with a dot in them, 2 of which are in the same row.\nQUESTION:\nAre there any X's or O's in the same row or column as the empty squares in your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: ANSWER: Yes, there are X's and O's in the same row or column as the empty squares in my grid.<end_of_utterance> \nUser: Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: QUESTION: Are there any X's or O's in the same row or column as the empty squares in your grid?<end_of_utterance> \nUser: ANSWER: Yes, there are X's and O's in the same row or column as the empty squares in my grid.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that have only X's or only O's?

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: DECISION: same grid<end_of_utterance>"], "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-21 11:34:59.087537", "call_duration": "0:00:03.163965", "response": "DECISION: same grid", "model_name": "idefics-80b-instruct"}}}]
