The empty squares are scattered throughout the grid, with one in each row and column.\nQUESTION:\nAre there any X's or ▢'s that are adjacent to each other in your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: ANSWER:\nYes, there are X's and ▢'s that are adjacent to each other in my grid.<end_of_utterance> \nUser: Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: QUESTION:\nAre there any empty squares that are adjacent to each other in your grid?<end_of_utterance> \nUser: ANSWER:\nNo, there are no empty squares that are adjacent to each other in my grid.\nQUESTION:\nAre there any X's or ▢'s that are adjacent to each other in your grid?

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<end_of_utterance> \nAssistant: DECISION: different grids<end_of_utterance>"], "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-05-21 08:04:03.825615", "call_duration": "0:00:04.675469", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "idefics-80b-instruct"}}}]
