The adult elephant is in the foreground, facing to the right, with its trunk extended downwards. The younger elephant is following behind, also facing to the right. The adult elephant has large ears and tusks, and the skin appears to be a mix of gray and brown. The background is a natural landscape with a slight incline and some scattered rocks
