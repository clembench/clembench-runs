Additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: \n'{\"action\":\"<action>\", \"description\": \"<room description>\", \"graph\": <graph>}'.\n<action> needs to be in the format \"GO: <direction>\" where <direction> is one of [north, east, south, west]. Alternatively, choose \"DONE\" as your action once you have explored the entire map.\n<room description> should be a single sentence describing the room shown to you.\n<graph> represents the map in this format: {\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}}\nOmit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\n\nHere is an example: \nWe are in this room. From here we can go: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"description\": \"We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}}}\nWe have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: east.
