Please give your answer in the following format: \"{\"description\": \"<room description>\", \"action\": \"<action>\"}\". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with \"GO: DIRECTION\" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with \"DONE\".

Please give your answer in the following format: \"{\"description\": \"<room description>\", \"action\": \"<action>\"}\". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with \"GO: DIRECTION\" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with \"DONE\".
