You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

The clue mentions \"crow\", which is a type of bird. I'll try to find a word that is related to birds or has a connection to the clue. The word \"calla\" is not directly related to crows, but it has 5 letters and includes the correct letter \"l\". I'll try to build upon this", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "crow", "critic_agreement": "no", "critic_explanation": "the guess \"trail\" does not match the clue \"crow\" as it does not contain the letter \"c\" which is present in the clue.", "guess_critic": "Word Guesser Critic (Llama-3-8B-groq)"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T10:54:38.389951", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "game_result = LOSS", "data_for_computation": {"player_1": "Llama-3-8B-groq", "player_2": "Llama-3-8B-groq", "total_attempts": 6, "turns_req_count": [3, 7, 10, 14, 20, 24], "turns_parse_count": [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18], "turns_guess_feedback": [["flake", "f<red> l<green> a<yellow> k<red> e<red>"], ["flake", "f<red> l<green> a<yellow> k<red> e<red>"], ["walks", "w<red> a<yellow> l<yellow> k<red> s<red>"], ["talks", "t<yellow> a<yellow> l<yellow> k<red> s<red>"], ["talks", "t<yellow> a<yellow> l<yellow> k<red> s<red>"], ["calla", "c<red> a<yellow> l<yellow> l<red> a<red>"]], "critic_guesses_change": [["frost", "flake", "no"], ["flake", "flake", "no"], ["flake", "walks", "no"], ["walks", "talks", "no"], ["talks", "talks", "no"], ["trail", "calla", "no"]], "guesser_error": null, "critic_error": null, "guesser retry count": 0, "critic retry count": 0, "guesser_req_count": 18, "critic_req_count": 6, "guesser_parsed_req_count": 12, "critic_parsed_req_count": 6, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_clue": "crow", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "game_final_status": "LOSS", "use_clue": true, "use_critic": true}}}]]}
