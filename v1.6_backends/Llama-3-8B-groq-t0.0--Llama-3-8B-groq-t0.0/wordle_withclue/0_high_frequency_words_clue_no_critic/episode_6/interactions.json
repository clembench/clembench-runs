You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:place to play\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-05T10:23:52.845772", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "What a delightful challenge!\n\nFor my first guess, I'll take a stab at \"guess: field\"\nexplanation: The clue mentions a \"place to play\", and \"field\" is a common location where people engage in various activities, such as sports or games.
