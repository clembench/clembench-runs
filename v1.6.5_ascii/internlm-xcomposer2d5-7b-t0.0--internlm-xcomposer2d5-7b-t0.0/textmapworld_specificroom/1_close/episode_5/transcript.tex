	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Guest room. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Based on the information provided, you are currently in the Living room and the target room is the Guest room. The available directions from the Living room are south and north. To reach the Guest room from the Living room, you would need to head in a direction that leads to the Guest room. If the Guest room is located to the south of the Living room, the next instruction would be "GO: south". If the Guest room is to the north, the instruction would be "GO: north". Without knowing the specific layout of the rooms, I cannot provide the exact direction to take. Therefore, the next instruction would be either "GO: south" or "GO: north", depending on the actual location of the Guest room in relation to the Living room.
