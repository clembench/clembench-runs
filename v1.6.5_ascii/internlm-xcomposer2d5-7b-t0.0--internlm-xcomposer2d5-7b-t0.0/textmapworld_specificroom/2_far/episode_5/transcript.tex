	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Balcony. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Based on the information provided, you are currently in the Living room and the target room is the Balcony. The available directions from the Living room are south and north. To reach the Balcony from the Living room, you would typically head in the direction of the Balcony, which is usually accessible from the living area. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: south\\ \tt \\ \tt This assumes that the Balcony is located to the south of the Living room. If the Balcony is to the north, the instruction would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have successfully entered the Balcony, the appropriate response would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE
