The available directions from the Basement are east, north, and south. To reach the target room, you would need to move in a direction that leads to the Nursery. Since the exact layout of the rooms is not provided, I cannot determine the specific direction to take. However, if the Nursery is directly accessible from the Basement, you would use the \"GO: DIRECTION\" format to indicate your movement. If the Nursery is not directly accessible from the Basement, you would need additional information about the room layout to determine the correct direction.
