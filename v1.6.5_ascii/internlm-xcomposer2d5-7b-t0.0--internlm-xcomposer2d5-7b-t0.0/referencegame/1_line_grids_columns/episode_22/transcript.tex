	 Expression: Target Grid\\ \tt The target grid is characterized by its alternating pattern of filled and empty cells, with the filled cells marked by "X" and the empty cells marked by "▢". In the target grid, there is a distinct pattern where every row and column alternates between filled and empty cells. This pattern is consistent throughout the grid, with the filled cells forming a checkerboard-like arrangement. The target grid is distinguished from the distractor grids by this alternating pattern, which is not present in the distractor grids. Therefore, the referring expression for the target grid, while distinguishing it from the distractor grids, would be: "Target Grid with alternating filled and empty cells in a checkerboard pattern."
