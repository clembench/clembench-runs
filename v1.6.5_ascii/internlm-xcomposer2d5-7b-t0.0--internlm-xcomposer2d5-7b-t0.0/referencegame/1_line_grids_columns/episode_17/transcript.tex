	 Expression: Target Grid\\ \tt The target grid is characterized by its alternating pattern of filled and empty cells. The filled cells are marked with "X", and the empty cells are marked with "▢". In the target grid, the filled cells are arranged in a specific pattern, with no more than two consecutive filled cells in any horizontal or vertical line. This pattern is distinct from the distractor grids, where either all cells are filled or all cells are empty. The target grid has a total of 25 cells, with 10 filled cells and 15 empty cells, arranged in a 5 by 5 grid.
