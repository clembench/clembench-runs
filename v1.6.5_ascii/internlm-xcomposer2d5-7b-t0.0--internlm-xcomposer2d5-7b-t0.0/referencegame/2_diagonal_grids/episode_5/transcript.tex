	 The referring expression for the target grid, starting with "Expression: ", is as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: Target Grid\\ \tt - The target grid is characterized by a single 'X' in the center of the grid, surrounded by '▢' on all other positions.\\ \tt - The 'X' is located at the intersection of the third row and second column from the top, and the second row and third column from the left.\\ \tt - The grid has a symmetrical pattern with the 'X' at the center, making it distinct from the other two distractor grids which have different arrangements of 'X' and '▢'.\\ \tt - The target grid does not have any 'X' in the first or last row or column, unlike the distractor grids.
