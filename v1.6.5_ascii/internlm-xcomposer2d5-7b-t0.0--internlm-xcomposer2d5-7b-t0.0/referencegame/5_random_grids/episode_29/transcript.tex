	 To describe the target grid while distinguishing it from the distractor grids, we can focus on the specific patterns of filled and empty cells. The target grid has a distinct pattern where the filled cells form an 'X' shape in the center, surrounded by empty cells. This pattern is unique to the target grid and not present in the distractor grids.\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, the referring expression for the target grid, starting with the tag "Expression: ", would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: Target Grid\\ \tt - The filled cells form an 'X' shape in the center.\\ \tt - The 'X' shape is surrounded by empty cells.\\ \tt - The top row has two filled cells, one in the middle and one to the right.\\ \tt - The bottom row has three filled cells, one in the middle and two to the left.\\ \tt \\ \tt This description captures the unique pattern of the target grid, allowing it to be distinguished from the distractor grids.
