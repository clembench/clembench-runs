	 To describe the target grid while distinguishing it from the two distractor grids, we can use the following referring expression:\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: Target Grid\\ \tt - The target grid has an 'X' in the top row, second from the left cell.\\ \tt - It has three 'X' cells in the second row, one in the leftmost cell, one in the middle, and one in the rightmost cell.\\ \tt - The third row has an 'X' in the second cell from the left.\\ \tt - The fourth row has an 'X' in the second cell from the left.\\ \tt - The fifth row has an 'X' in the second cell from the left and the third cell from the right.\\ \tt \\ \tt This referring expression captures the unique arrangement of 'X' and '▢' cells in the target grid, which is distinct from the patterns in the distractor grids.
