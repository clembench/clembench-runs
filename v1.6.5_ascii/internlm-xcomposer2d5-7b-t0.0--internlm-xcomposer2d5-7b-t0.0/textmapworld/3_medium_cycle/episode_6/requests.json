The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

However, to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, it would be more efficient to choose the direction that leads to the most rooms. Without knowing the layout of the entire house or the number of rooms in each direction, it's not possible to determine the most efficient path.

If moving south leads to more rooms to visit:\n   GO: south\n\nPlease choose the direction that corresponds to the room you wish to visit next.
