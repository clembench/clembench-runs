The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

To proceed with the fewest number of room changes possible, you should choose the direction that leads to the next room you need to visit. If you have a list of rooms to visit, you should refer to that list to determine your next move. If you don't have a list, you can make an educated guess based on the layout of the rooms you've already visited. Once you have decided on a direction, you should respond with \"GO: DIRECTION\" where \"DIRECTION\" is either north, south, east, or west.
