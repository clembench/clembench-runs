	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?

	 Based on the given instructions and the current situation where you are in the Pantry with available directions south and north, the next instruction would be to choose one of these directions to proceed. Since the goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, it would be strategic to choose the direction that leads to the most rooms. However, without knowing the layout of the rooms and their connections, it is not possible to determine the best direction to take. Therefore, I would need more information about the room layout to provide a more specific instruction. In the absence of this information, a general instruction could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: choose a direction (south or north)\\ \tt \\ \tt This would allow you to explore and make decisions based on the rooms you encounter. If you reach a point where there are no new rooms to visit, you would then answer with "DONE" to indicate the completion of the task.
