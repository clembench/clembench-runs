The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Since the current room is the Game room and there are three available directions: north, west, and east, without knowing the layout of the rooms or which rooms have already been visited, a logical approach would be to choose a direction that has not been tried before. Therefore, the next instruction could be:\n\nGO: west\n\nThis assumes that the west direction has not been attempted yet. If it has, then the next untried direction should be chosen. The goal is to systematically explore all possible paths without backtracking, which would increase the number of room changes. If at any point there are no new rooms to visit, the exploration should stop, and the instruction would be:\n\nDONE"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-25T18:54:25.508441", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
