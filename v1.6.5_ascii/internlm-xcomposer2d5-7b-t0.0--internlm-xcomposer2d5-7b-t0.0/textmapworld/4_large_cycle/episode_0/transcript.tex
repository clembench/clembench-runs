	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: north, west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 Based on the provided context and the objective to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, the next instruction would be to choose the direction that leads to an unvisited room. Since the current room is the Game room and there are three available directions: north, west, and east, without knowing the layout of the rooms or which rooms have already been visited, a logical approach would be to choose a direction that has not been tried before. Therefore, the next instruction could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt \\ \tt This assumes that the west direction has not been attempted yet. If it has, then the next untried direction should be chosen. The goal is to systematically explore all possible paths without backtracking, which would increase the number of room changes. If at any point there are no new rooms to visit, the exploration should stop, and the instruction would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE
