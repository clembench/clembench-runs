The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Since the goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, it would be logical to select the direction that offers the most new rooms to explore. Without knowing the layout of the entire house, it's not possible to determine the best direction to take. However, if we assume that the Home gym is a central room, going west or east might lead to new rooms, while going south might just lead back to the same room. Therefore, a reasonable next instruction could be:\n\nGO: west\n\nThis choice is based on the assumption that going west from the Home gym might lead to a new room to visit, helping to achieve the goal of visiting all rooms with the fewest number of changes."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-25T18:59:32.329695", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
