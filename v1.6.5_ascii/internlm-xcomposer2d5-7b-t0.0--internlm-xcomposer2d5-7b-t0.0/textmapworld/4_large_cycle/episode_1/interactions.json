The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Since the goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, it would be best to choose the direction that leads to the most rooms. If both directions lead to the same number of rooms, then any one of them can be chosen. However, without knowing the layout of the rooms and the number of rooms in each direction, it is not possible to determine the best direction to go. Therefore, I would need more information to provide the next instruction."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-25T18:54:39.171908", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
