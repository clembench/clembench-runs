The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

To visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, you should choose the direction that will lead you to the most rooms. Since we don't have the layout of the entire house or the number of rooms in each direction, we can't determine the optimal path without additional information. However, if we assume that the rooms are arranged in a standard layout, going west from the Sunroom might lead you to more rooms than going south. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\n\nGO: west\n\nPlease note that this is a hypothetical decision based on limited information. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider the actual layout of the house and the number of rooms in each direction to make the most efficient path."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-25T18:48:36.629735", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
