The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Since we don't have information about which rooms have been visited before, we can't make an informed decision based on that. Therefore, the best course of action would be to explore both directions until a new room is found. If both directions lead to rooms that have already been visited, then we would have to backtrack to the last unvisited room and continue from there. However, if one of the directions leads to a new room, we would take that path. If both directions lead to new rooms, we would choose the one that minimizes the number of room changes. If both directions lead back to the same room, we would backtrack to the last unvisited room and continue from there.
