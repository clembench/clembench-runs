	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sunroom. Currently available directions: south, north, west. What is your next instruction?

	 Based on the information provided, you are currently in the Sunroom with available directions to the south, north, and west. To visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible, you should choose the direction that leads to the next room you haven't visited yet. Since there is no indication of which rooms have been visited or which ones are left to visit, a logical approach would be to choose the direction that seems most likely to lead to an unvisited room. In this case, without knowing the layout of the rooms, it's impossible to determine the best direction to take. However, if we assume that the rooms are arranged in a standard layout, going north might be a reasonable choice as it could lead to another room that hasn't been visited yet. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt \\ \tt Please note that this is a hypothetical response based on limited information, and the actual best direction may vary depending on the specific layout of the rooms.
