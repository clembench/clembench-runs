There are four cells that are not filled with an 'X', which are instead filled with a '▢' (an empty square). These empty squares form a vertical line in the third column from the left. Starting from the top, the first and second rows have the empty square in the third column. The third row is filled entirely with 'X's. The fourth and fifth rows repeat the pattern of the first and second rows, with the empty square in the third column.
