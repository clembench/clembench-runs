	 ANSWER: Yes, in the second row of my grid, there are four empty squares with the filled square (X) located in the center.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
