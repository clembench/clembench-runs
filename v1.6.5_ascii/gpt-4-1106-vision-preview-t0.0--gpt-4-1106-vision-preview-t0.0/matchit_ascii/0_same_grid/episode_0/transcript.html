Now start your short grid description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

Inside the border, there is an alternating pattern of blank spaces (▢) and X&#x27;s, starting with a blank space in each corner of the inner 3x3 square. The pattern goes like this: blank, X, blank, X, blank in the first inner row, then X, blank, X, blank, X in the second inner row, and repeats the pattern of the first inner row in the third inner row.</p>
