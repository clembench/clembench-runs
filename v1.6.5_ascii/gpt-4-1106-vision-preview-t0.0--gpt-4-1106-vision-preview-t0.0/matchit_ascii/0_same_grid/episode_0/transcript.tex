	 ANSWER: In my grid, the center positions of each side of the border (the middle X of each side of the 5x5 square) are directly adjacent to a blank space (▢) on their immediate right or left inside the border.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
