The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.

Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].
