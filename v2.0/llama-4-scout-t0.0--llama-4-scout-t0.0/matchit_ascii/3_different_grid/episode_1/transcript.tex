	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have blank squares in the first and second columns of the second and fourth rows; it has a mix of X's and blank squares in those rows.\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Are the X's in the first and last columns of your grid consistent across all rows?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
