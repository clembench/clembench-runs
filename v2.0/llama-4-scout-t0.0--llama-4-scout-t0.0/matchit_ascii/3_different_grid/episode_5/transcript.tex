	 ANSWER: No, I don't have any rows with only one X and the rest being blank squares; all my rows have multiple X's or a significant number of X's except for none being completely blank.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
