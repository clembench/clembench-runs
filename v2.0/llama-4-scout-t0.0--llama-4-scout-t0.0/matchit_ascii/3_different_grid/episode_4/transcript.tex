	 ANSWER: Yes, the three consecutive X's in the middle three rows of my grid are aligned horizontally and occupy the same column positions in those rows.\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have empty cells above and below the middle rows that contain the X's, specifically, are there ▢ cells both above and below the rows with X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
