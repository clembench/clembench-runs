This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:25:10.891153", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants to gather maximum information about the target word. \"CRANE\" is a good choice because it has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).  \nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:25:10.891411", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = never\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:25:10.891582", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-26T10:25:16.763880", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"r\", \"n\", and \"e\" are in the word but not in their current positions, while \"c\" and \"a\" are absent.
