You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:46.815530", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:46.816089", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = party\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:46.816206", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:51.938302", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'll try a new word with a different set of letters, focusing on common English words with a good balance of vowels and consonants.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:51.938656", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = party\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:51.938756", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:59.147338", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"r\" and \"a\" from the previous guess were marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct position, so I'll try to utilize them in a new word, while introducing new letters to increase the chances of getting more correct letters.\nguess: wrath"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:59.147822", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = party\nguess = wrath\nguess_feedback = w<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> t<green> h<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:09:59.147922", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> t<green> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:10:07.824615", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"r\", \"a\", and \"t\" from the previous guess were marked as yellow or green, indicating they are in the word, so I'll try to utilize them in a new word, focusing on placing \"t\" in the correct position and rearranging \"r\" and \"a\" to find the correct order.\nguess: tartan"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:10:07.824963", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The length of the guessed word is not 5."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T19:10:07.825060", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 4, "Complete turns": 3, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 1], "Parsed Request Count": [1, 1, 1, 0], "Violated Request Count": [0, 0, 0, 1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "party", "target_word_clue": "have a ball", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [["house", "h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"], ["bread", "b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"], ["wrath", "w<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> t<green> h<red>"]], "guess_explanation": ["I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.", "Since all the letters in the previous guess were incorrect, I'll try a new word with a different set of letters, focusing on common English words with a good balance of vowels and consonants.", "The letters \"r\" and \"a\" from the previous guess were marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct position, so I'll try to utilize them in a new word, while introducing new letters to increase the chances of getting more correct letters."], "critic_feedback": {}}}
