	 ANSWER: My grid has the same number of X's in the top and bottom rows as your grid, with a single X in each of those rows.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the single X's in the top and bottom rows of your grid positioned in the same column as the single X's in the top and bottom rows of my grid?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
