	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: kind of closet\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue "kind of closet" suggests a type of storage space. A common five-letter word for a closet is "armoire," but it's too long. Another option is "linen," which refers to a linen closet, but it doesn't fit the letter count. "Cedar" is a type of wood used in closets, but it doesn't directly mean a closet. "Chest" is a five-letter word that refers to a type of storage furniture, which could be considered a kind of closet.  \\ \tt guess: chest

	 explanation: The feedback confirms that "l" is in the correct position, while all other letters are incorrect. The clue "kind of closet" suggests a storage-related word. A possible word is "loft," but it's too short. Another option is "lumen," but it doesn't fit the context. Revisiting the feedback and clue, "latch" was incorrect, so a new approach is needed. A possible word is "liver," but it doesn't fit the clue. Considering the feedback, "latch" was close, but perhaps "latch" is not the correct word. A better fit might be "latch" again, but since it was incorrect, another guess is "latch" is not the correct word.
