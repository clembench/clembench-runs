Since \"e\" was also incorrect in the first guess, I'll try to introduce new vowels and consonants, keeping \"s\" as the starting letter, to increase the chances of getting more correct letters.\nguess: slash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> a<red> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"s\" is still in the correct position, \"l\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and the letters \"a\", \"s\", and \"h\" are not in the target word. Considering the previous feedback where \"s\" was also yellow, I'll try to utilize the correct position of \"s\" and the presence of \"l\" to make a new guess, introducing new letters to fill in the blanks.\nguess: slo", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-24 19:51:08.241277", "call_duration": "0:00:11.543002", "response": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"s\" is still in the correct position, \"l\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and the letters \"a\", \"s\", and \"h\" are not in the target word.
