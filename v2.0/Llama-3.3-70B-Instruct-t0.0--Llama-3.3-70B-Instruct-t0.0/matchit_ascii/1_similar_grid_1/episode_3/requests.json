Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no rows in my grid that are completely filled with blank squares, but there are columns with a majority of blank squares, and the fifth row is completely filled with X's, while the other rows have a mix of X's and blank squares, except for the first column which is filled with X's.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns that are completely filled with X's, similar to the first column in my grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The blank squares in my grid are not symmetrically arranged, they appear to be randomly scattered throughout the grid, with no apparent symmetry when folding the grid in half horizontally or vertically, except for the fact that the first column is filled with X's, which creates a sense of symmetry in that specific column.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a row that is completely filled with X's, similar to the fifth row in my grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Regarding the third row, yes, the first two columns are filled with X's, and the remaining columns are filled with ▢'s, with two ▢'s at the end of the row.\nQUESTION: How many blank squares are present in the second and fourth rows of your grid, and are they contiguous or separated by X's, and does their arrangement match the arrangement of ▢'s in the corresponding rows of my grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The second and fourth rows of my grid each have four blank squares, and they are contiguous, filling the last four columns of those rows, with a single X in the first column of each row, so the blank squares are separated from the X by being in different columns, and it seems that this arrangement might match the arrangement of ▢'s in the corresponding rows of your grid, given that you mentioned the ▢'s are mostly concentrated in the middle three columns, but<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow come to a decision.
