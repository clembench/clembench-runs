	 ANSWER: The second and fourth rows of my grid each have four blank squares, and they are contiguous, filling the last four columns of those rows, with a single X in the first column of each row, so the blank squares are separated from the X by being in different columns, and it seems that this arrangement might match the arrangement of ▢'s in the corresponding rows of your grid, given that you mentioned the ▢'s are mostly concentrated in the middle three columns, but\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
