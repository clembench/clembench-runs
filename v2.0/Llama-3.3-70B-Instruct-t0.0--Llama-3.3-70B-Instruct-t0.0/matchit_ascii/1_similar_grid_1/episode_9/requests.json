Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the patterns in the first and last rows of my grid are identical to each other, and the filled squares (X) in the first and last rows of my grid are positioned in the middle column. Additionally, the second and fourth rows of my grid are identical to each other.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any columns in your grid where all the squares are unfilled (▢), meaning that there are no filled squares (X) in that entire column?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are columns in my grid where all the squares are unfilled (▢), specifically the first and last columns have no filled squares (X) in the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows, but they do have filled squares (X) in the middle row.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns with only one filled square (X) in the entire column?\nQUESTION: Are there any pairs of adjacent rows in your grid, excluding the completely filled middle row, where the filled squares (X) are positioned directly above or below each other? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has columns with only one filled square (X) in the entire column, specifically the first and last columns. Additionally, there are pairs of adjacent rows in my grid, excluding the completely filled middle row, where the filled squares (X) are positioned directly above or below each other, namely the second and third rows, and the third and fourth rows, but not the first and second or the fourth and fifth rows.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
