	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has instances where a filled square (X) is surrounded on both sides by unfilled squares (▢) within the same row, and there are four such instances, specifically in the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows, where the middle X is surrounded by unfilled squares (▢) on both sides.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have the same number of filled squares (X) as my description suggests, with a total of 13 filled squares\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
