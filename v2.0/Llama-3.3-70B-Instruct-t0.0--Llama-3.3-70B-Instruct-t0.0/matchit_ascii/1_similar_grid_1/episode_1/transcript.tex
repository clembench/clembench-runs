	 ANSWER: Yes, the number of ▢'s in each row of my grid increases by exactly one as you move from the top row to the bottom row, resulting in a total of 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 ▢'s in the entire grid.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have the same total number of ▢'s, which is 10, as my grid?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
