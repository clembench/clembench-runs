	 ANSWER: The corrected description of the third row is the only difference, my initial description mentioned blank squares, but it was corrected to ▢'s, and the rest of the grid remains as initially described, with the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows being completely filled with X's, and only the third row having the mix of ▢'s and an X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
