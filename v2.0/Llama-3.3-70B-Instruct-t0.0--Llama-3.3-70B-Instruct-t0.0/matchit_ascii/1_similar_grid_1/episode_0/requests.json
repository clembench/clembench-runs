Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The ▢'s in my grid are limited to only the second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, my grid does not have any row that has a mix of X's and ▢'s in the same row, except for the rows that have a ▢ in the second column and X's in the other columns, but there is no row with ▢'s at the first and last positions and an X in the middle like your grid has, the rows in my grid that have ▢'s have them only in the second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the rows in your grid that do not have the mix of X's and ▢'s in the third row, similar to the rows in my grid, with a ▢ in the second column and X's in the other columns, or do they have a different pattern?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The rows in my grid that do not have the mix of X's and ▢'s, which are all rows except the third row, are completely filled with X's, they do not have a ▢ in the second column, they are solid rows of X's from the first column to the last column.\nQUESTION: How many rows in your grid have a ▢ in the second column, is it all rows except the third row which is completely filled with X's, or is it only some of the rows? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: All rows in my grid, except the third row which is completely filled with X's, have a ▢ in the second column, so four out of the five rows have a ▢ in the second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?
