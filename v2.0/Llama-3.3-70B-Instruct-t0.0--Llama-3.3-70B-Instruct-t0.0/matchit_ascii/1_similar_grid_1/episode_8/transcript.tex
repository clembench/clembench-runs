	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the X's on the border are the only X's present, with no X's in the inner cells of those rows. Specifically, the first and last rows of my grid have X's only on the borders and ▢'s in all the inner cells, with no inner X's. As for columns, there are two columns where the X's on the border are the only X's, and the inner cells of those columns do not contain\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
