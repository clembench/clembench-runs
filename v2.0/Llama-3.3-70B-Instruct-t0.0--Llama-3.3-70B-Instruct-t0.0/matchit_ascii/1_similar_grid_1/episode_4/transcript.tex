	 ANSWER: The fact that the third row is completely filled with ▢'s in both our grids is a strong indication that the grids may be similar, but it does not necessarily mean they are identical, as we have already discovered differences in the descriptions of the second and fourth rows, and it's possible that there may be other subtle differences that we haven't discovered yet, so further comparison is needed to confirm whether the grids are identical or not.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
