	 ANSWER: Yes, the first and last columns of my grid are identical, with the same pattern of X's, having X's in the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows, and this matches the pattern you described for your grid.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given the similarities and differences we've discussed, do you think our grids are likely to be the same, or are there still some uncertainties that need to be clarified?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
