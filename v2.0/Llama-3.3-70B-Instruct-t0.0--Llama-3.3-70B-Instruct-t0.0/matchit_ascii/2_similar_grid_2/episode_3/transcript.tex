	 ANSWER: The first column of the third row in my grid is a blank square (▢), so the three consecutive X's in the third row are actually located in columns 2, 3, and 4, and the first column has a blank square, and the rightmost column, as mentioned earlier, has an X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
