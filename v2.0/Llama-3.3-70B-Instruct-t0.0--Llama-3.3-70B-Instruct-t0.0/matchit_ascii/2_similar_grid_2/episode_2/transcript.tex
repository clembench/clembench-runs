	 ANSWER: The blank squares in my grid do create some distinctive shapes, particularly a vertical line of blank squares in the second column, and also some smaller groups of blank squares that form L-shapes or small clusters, but there are no large squares or horizontal lines formed by the blank squares.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have a row that is identical to the row above or below it, i.e., a pair of rows that have the same pattern of X's and ▢'s?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
