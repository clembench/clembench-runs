Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid where the X's are clustered together in a single group, such as two or three X's in a row, without any intervening blank squares?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is one row in my grid where the X's are clustered together in a single group, specifically the third row, which has three consecutive X's with no intervening blank squares.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any rows or columns where the X's and ▢'s alternate, i.e., an X is followed by a ▢, which is followed by an X, and so on?\nQUESTION: Are the X's in the inner area of your grid (not on the border) limited to only the middle row, or are they distributed across multiple rows within the inner area? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, my grid does not have any rows or columns where the X's and ▢'s alternate in the pattern you described. As for the distribution of X's in the inner area, the X's are not limited to only the middle row, but are distributed across multiple rows within the inner area, specifically the second and fourth rows, in addition to the middle row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
