	 ANSWER: Yes, the blank spaces in the fifth row of my grid are completely empty, with no other symbols or marks, and they are distributed in a way that has blank spaces in the second and fourth positions, which matches the distribution of blank spaces in the fifth row of your grid, as you described it, with no X in the second, third, and fourth positions, but only in the first, and fifth positions, and also my grid has an X in the third position of the\\ \tt Now come to a decision.
