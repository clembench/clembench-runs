	 ANSWER: The X's in my grid are not limited to the rows I've mentioned so far, as I also have an X in the first position of the first row, and besides the X's in the first, second, and third rows, there is also an X in the first position of the first row, but I also have an X in the first row, and the rest of the X's are in the third row, and there are no other X's in any other positions\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
