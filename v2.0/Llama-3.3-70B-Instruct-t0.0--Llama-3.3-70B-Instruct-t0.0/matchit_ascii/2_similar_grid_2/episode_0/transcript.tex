	 ANSWER: Yes, that's correct, the first column of my grid, except for the top row, is completely filled with ▢'s, and the top row of my grid is completely filled with X's, with no ▢'s in the first column of the top row, which means the first column of my grid has an X in the top row and ▢'s in the rest of the rows, except for the last row which is also all ▢'s\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
