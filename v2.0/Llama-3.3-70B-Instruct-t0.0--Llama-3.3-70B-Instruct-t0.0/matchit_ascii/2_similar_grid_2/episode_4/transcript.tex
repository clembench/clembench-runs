	 ANSWER: No, the first and last rows of my grid are not completely filled with X's, they have X's on the edges and in the middle, but with ▢'s in the second and fourth positions, so the X's in these rows are not continuous, there are breaks in the row of X's where the ▢'s are present, specifically, the pattern is X ▢ X X X. QUESTION: Does your grid have the exact same pattern in the first\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
