	 ANSWER: The top row of my grid has 3 blank squares, with X's at the first and last positions, similar to the top row of your grid, which also has X's at the edges, so in this respect, the top rows of our grids share a similarity.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any rows where the X's are positioned in the same column, but in different rows, such as two or more X's stacked below each other in the same column, but not\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
