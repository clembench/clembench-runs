	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have any columns where all the positions are filled with ▢'s, meaning there are no X's in that entire column, but it does have a column where there is only one X.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any columns where there is only one X, and if so, is it in the same column as the column with only one X in my grid?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
