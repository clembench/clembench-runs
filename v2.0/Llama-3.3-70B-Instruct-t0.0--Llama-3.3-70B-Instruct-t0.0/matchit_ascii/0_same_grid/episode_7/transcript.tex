	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has the same number of X's as your grid, and the total count of X's in my grid is indeed equal to 7, which matches the number of X's you have in your grid, and upon reviewing the distribution of X's in my grid, I notice that it could potentially match the distribution in your grid, considering the patterns and arrangements we've discussed so far, which suggests a high likelihood that our grids might be identical.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
