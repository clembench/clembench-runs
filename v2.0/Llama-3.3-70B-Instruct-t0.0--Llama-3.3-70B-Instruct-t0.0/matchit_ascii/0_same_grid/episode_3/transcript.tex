	 ANSWER: The number and arrangement of ▢'s in the fourth and fifth rows of my grid are identical, with all four positions to the left of the rightmost X being filled with ▢'s, resulting in the same pattern of ▢'s in both the fourth and fifth rows.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
