	 ANSWER: No, there is nothing unusual or distinctive about the way the grid is presented or displayed in my version, it is a plain and simple grid with no border, background color or pattern, or any other visual elements that are not part of the grid itself, it is just the X's and the ▢ symbols arranged in the 5x5 pattern.\\ \tt QUESTION: At this point, considering all the similarities and the lack of any apparent differences, are you willing to make an educated guess\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
