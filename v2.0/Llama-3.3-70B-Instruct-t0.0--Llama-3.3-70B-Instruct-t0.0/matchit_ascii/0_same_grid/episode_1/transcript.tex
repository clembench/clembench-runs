	 ANSWER: Yes, the X's and's in my grid are represented by the exact same symbols as in your original grid description, with the X's being a standard uppercase letter "X" and the's being a square symbol, indicating that the visual representation of the characters in both grids is identical.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
