	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has the same number of X's as your grid, with a total of 13 X's, and they are distributed in such a way that the number of X's in each row is the same as in your grid, with 2 X's in the first and last rows, 2 X's in the second and fourth rows, and 3 X's in the third row, and also 3 X's in the first and last columns, and the\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
