Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Given the information we have exchanged, it seems likely that our grids are identical, as we have found no differences in structure, arrangement, or elements. However, it's theoretically possible that there could be some extremely subtle or unusual difference that we haven't considered. The blank squares in my grid are represented by the same symbol, ▢, as in your grid, indicating empty or unmarked spaces.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
