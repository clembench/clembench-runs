	 ANSWER: The overall orientation and alignment of my grid is the same as yours, with the rows being horizontal and the columns being vertical, and the grid is aligned to the edges of its containing space, with no rotation, skewing, or other unusual orientation.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given that we have now discussed the structure, arrangement, elements, representation, and orientation of our grids, and found no differences, can we conclusively determine that our grids are identical, or should we continue to explore extremely unlikely\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
