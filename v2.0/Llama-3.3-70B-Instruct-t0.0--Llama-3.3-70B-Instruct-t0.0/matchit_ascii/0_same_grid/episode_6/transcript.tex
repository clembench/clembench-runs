	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the X's are separated by only one blank square, specifically in the second row where there is a blank square between two X's.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the last three rows of your grid identical to each other, having the same pattern of X's and blank squares?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
