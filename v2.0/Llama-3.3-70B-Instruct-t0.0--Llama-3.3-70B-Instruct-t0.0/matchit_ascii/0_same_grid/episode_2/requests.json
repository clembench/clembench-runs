Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are rows in my grid where all the inner ▢'s are uninterrupted by X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the X's inside your grid, but not part of the border, placed symmetrically, meaning that if you were to fold the grid in the middle, the inner X's would match up on both sides?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, the X's inside my grid, but not part of the border, are not placed symmetrically, as there is an X in the second row that does not have a matching X on the other side if the grid were folded in the middle.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any rows or columns where the X's in the border are adjacent to each other, both horizontally and vertically, without any ▢'s separating them, other than the top and bottom border rows? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the X's in the border are adjacent to each other, both horizontally, and there are also columns where the X's in the border are adjacent to each other vertically, without any ▢'s separating them, other than the top and bottom border rows, specifically the second row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any columns in your grid where there is only one X, and it is part of the border, with the rest of the column consisting entirely of ▢'s?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are columns in my grid where there is only one X at the top or bottom border, with the rest of the column consisting entirely of ▢'s, specifically the second and fourth columns from either side have this pattern, but considering the border X's at both top and bottom, these columns have two X's and the rest ▢'s.\nQUESTION: Are the inner X's in your grid limited to only the second row, or are there inner X's in other rows as well, similar to the third row in my grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The inner X's in my grid are not limited to only the second row, as there are also inner X's in the third row, similar to what you described in your grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any identical rows, meaning that there are two or more rows that have the exact same pattern of X's and's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has identical rows, specifically the last two rows (fourth and fifth rows) are identical, both having the same pattern of X's and ▢'s.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
