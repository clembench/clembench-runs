	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has identical rows, specifically the last two rows (fourth and fifth rows) are identical, both having the same pattern of X's and ▢'s.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
