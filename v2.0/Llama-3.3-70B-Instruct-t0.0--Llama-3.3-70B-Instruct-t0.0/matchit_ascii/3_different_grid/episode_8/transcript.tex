	 ANSWER: In my grid, the ▢'s are always to the right of the X's in the rows where the number of X's is less than 5, meaning that the sequence of consecutive X's is followed by the ▢'s, and there are no ▢'s before or in between the X's in any of the rows, the X's always occupy the leftmost positions in each row and the ▢'s occupy the remaining positions to the right of\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
