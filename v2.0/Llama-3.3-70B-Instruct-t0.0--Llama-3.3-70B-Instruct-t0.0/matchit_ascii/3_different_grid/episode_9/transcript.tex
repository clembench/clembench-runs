	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have any rows where all the positions are filled with the same symbol, as each row has a mix of X's and ▢'s, but there are no columns where all the positions are filled with the same symbol either, as the X's and ▢'s are distributed across the columns in a way that creates a varied pattern.\\ \tt QUESTION: You mentioned that the third row of your grid has X's in the first, second, fourth,\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
