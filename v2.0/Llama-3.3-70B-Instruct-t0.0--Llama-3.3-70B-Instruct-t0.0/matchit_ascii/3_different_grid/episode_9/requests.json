Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: In my grid, there are no rows that contain only a single X, and there are rows that contain no X's at all, specifically the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows, which are completely filled with ▢'s, while the third row contains two X's and one ▢, and the X's are in the first and second positions, and also the fourth and fifth positions, not just the first and second.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The X's in the third row of my grid appear to be isolated to just that one row, with no relation to the surrounding rows, and do not seem to be part of a larger pattern or structure that spans the entire grid, as the other rows are completely filled with ▢'s and do not contain any X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
