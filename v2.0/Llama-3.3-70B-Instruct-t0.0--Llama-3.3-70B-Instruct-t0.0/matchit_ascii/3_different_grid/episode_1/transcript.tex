	 ANSWER: There are no empty or blank cells in my grid, as all cells are filled with either X's or ▢'s, and the ▢'s represent the filled cells that are not X's, so every cell in my grid has a symbol, either an X or a ▢.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does the first and last column of your grid have the same arrangement of X's and ▢'s, or are they different, and if they are different, how do\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
