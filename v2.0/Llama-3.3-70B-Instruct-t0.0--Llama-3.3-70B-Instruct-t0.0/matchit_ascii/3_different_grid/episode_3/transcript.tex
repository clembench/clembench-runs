	 ANSWER: Yes, the top row of my grid has only a single X, and the four remaining squares in the row are empty, with the single X being positioned at the end of the row, specifically in the fifth column, and the four empty squares being positioned in the first four columns, creating a row with a sequence of four empty squares followed by a single X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
