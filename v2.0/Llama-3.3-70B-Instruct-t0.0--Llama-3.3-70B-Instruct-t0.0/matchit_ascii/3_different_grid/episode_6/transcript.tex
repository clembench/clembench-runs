	 ANSWER: The solid sequence of three X's in one of the middle rows of my grid is positioned at the left edge of the row, occupying the first three columns, and is immediately followed by a blank square, and then another X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
