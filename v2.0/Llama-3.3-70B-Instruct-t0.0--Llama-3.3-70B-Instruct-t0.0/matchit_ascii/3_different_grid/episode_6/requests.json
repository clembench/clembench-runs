Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The top and bottom rows of my grid have X's on the very edges (first and last column), and the second, third, and fourth columns of those rows are empty, so beyond the first column, there are no X's in the top and bottom rows, they are empty except for the edge X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
