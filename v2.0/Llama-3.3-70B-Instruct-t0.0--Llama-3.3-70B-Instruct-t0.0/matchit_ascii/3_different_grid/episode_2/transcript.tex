	 ANSWER: Yes, there are X's in the middle column of my grid, and in fact, the middle column contains a total of 5 X's, with one X in each of the 5 rows, and they are distributed evenly throughout the column, with one X per row, forming a vertical line of X's that spans the entire height of the grid.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any rotational symmetry, meaning that if you were to rotate the grid by 90 degrees, it\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
