Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The X's in my grid are limited to the edges, with no X's in the interior of the grid, within the 3x3 middle section, and no, my grid does not have any rows or columns that contain exactly two X's, with the rest of the spaces in that row or column being blank.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the X's on the edges of my grid are continuous, meaning that every space on the edge is filled with an X, with no blank spaces on the edges, the edges are completely filled with X's, forming a solid border around the inner 3x3 section of blank spaces.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
