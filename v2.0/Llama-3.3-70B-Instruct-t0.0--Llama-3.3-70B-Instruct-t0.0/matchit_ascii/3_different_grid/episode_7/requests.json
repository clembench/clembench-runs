Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The symmetry I mentioned does apply to the entire grid, meaning that if you were to fold the grid in half horizontally along the middle row, the two halves would match perfectly. As for the columns, there are no columns that contain only ▢'s, with no X's present, as all columns have at least one X in them, often multiple X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
