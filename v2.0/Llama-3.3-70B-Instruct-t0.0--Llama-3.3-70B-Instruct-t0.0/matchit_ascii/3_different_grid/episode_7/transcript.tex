	 ANSWER: The gaps in the top and bottom borders of my grid are singular ▢'s, and they are symmetrically positioned, with one ▢ on each side of the grid, creating a sense of balance and mirroring.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given the symmetry and patterns you've described in your grid, do you think it's possible for your grid and my grid to be identical, or are there any features that you've mentioned that would necessarily distinguish them?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
