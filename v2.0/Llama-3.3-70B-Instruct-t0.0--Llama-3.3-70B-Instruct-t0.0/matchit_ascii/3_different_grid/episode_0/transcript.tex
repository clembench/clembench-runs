	 ANSWER: Yes, the size of my grid is also 5x5, and the X's on the perimeter of my grid are one cell thick, occupying only a single row and column on the edges, which matches the description of your grid, suggesting that the overall structure and size of our grids are identical, with the main difference potentially being the arrangement of X's inside the grid.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
