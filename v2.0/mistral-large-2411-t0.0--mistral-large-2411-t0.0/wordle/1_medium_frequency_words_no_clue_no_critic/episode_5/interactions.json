This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:40:36.113816", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start with the word \"arise\" as it contains common vowels and consonants.\nguess: arise"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:40:36.114156", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = silly\nguess = arise\nguess_feedback = a<red> r<red> i<yellow> s<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:40:36.114312", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> r<red> i<yellow> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:40:38.234675", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" and \"s\" are in the word but in the wrong position.
