You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ Y Y Y\n▢ ▢ ▢ Y ▢\nY ▢ Y ▢ Y\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Y\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCommand: Put a Y in the first row, third, fourth, and fifth columns<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next command?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCommand: Put a Y in the second row, fourth column<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next command?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCommand: Put a Y in the third row, first, third, and fifth columns<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next command?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nCommand: Put a Y in the fourth row, fifth column<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-20 15:14:35.694914", "call_duration": "0:00:00.410038", "response": "Command: Put a Y in the fourth row, fifth column", "model_name": "llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_playpen"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-03-20T15:14:37.095432", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "Let us draw something together.
