The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Home office. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: south<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Wine cellar. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: north<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Home office. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: south<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Wine cellar. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: south<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Game room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: north<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Wine cellar.

Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: north\n\n(Note: The assumption here is that the Game room has already been visited and there are no new rooms to explore in the north direction. If the Game room has not been fully explored or if there are new rooms to the north, the command would be appropriate. However, if the Game room has no new directions to explore, the user should recognize this and respond with \"DONE\" when they are certain there are no new rooms to visit.)\n\nSince the problem does", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 23:01:19.769928", "call_duration": "0:00:09.053709", "response": "GO: north\n\n(Note: The assumption here is that the Game room has already been visited and there are no new rooms to explore in the north direction.
