Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Library. Currently available directions: west, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: north<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Basement. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: south<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Library. Currently available directions: west, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: west<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Workshop. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: north<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Laundry room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next command?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: south<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Workshop.

The north direction leads to the Bedroom, which has not been visited yet. However, since the task is to visit all rooms with the fewest number of room changes and we are aware that going north from the Library leads to the Bedroom and then potentially to other rooms, we continue in that direction.
