This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n<|assistant|>\nDESCRIPTION: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with X's in positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,5) and the rest are empty spaces (▢).\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the first row?
