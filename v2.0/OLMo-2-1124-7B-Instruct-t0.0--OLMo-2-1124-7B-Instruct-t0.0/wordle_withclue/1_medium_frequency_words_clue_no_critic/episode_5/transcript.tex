	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: fatuous\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue "fatuous" suggests a word that conveys a sense of silly or foolishness. Considering the word length and the clue, I will guess a word that might fit this description and has five lowercase letters. One such word is "dunce," which refers to a person regarded as stupid or foolish.\\ \tt guess: dunce

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that none of the letters in the guess "dunce" match the target word. The red letters suggest that none of those specific letters appear in the target word, while the absence of green letters means no letter is in the correct position. Given this information, I will exclude "d," "u," "n," "c," and "e" from my next guess and consider other words that might fit the clue "fatuous."\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: sage
