However, based on the goal and the actions that logically follow from the given scenario, let's proceed with the assumption that there is indeed a wardrobe, even if it's not explicitly visible in the current description.\n\nSince the freezer is empty and we need to place the broom there, we'll assume there's a way to interact with the space that represents the freezer, even if it's not described as such. Let's continue with the assumption that there's a way to place the broom in the freezer, even if the game doesn't explicitly describe it.\n\nGiven these assumptions, here's the next logical step:\n\n> place broom in freezer\n\nNext actions: put apple in cupboard, put book in invisible wardrobe, close freezer, confirm all items are in their intended locations based on the goal.\n\nIf the game does not allow for this action due to a lack of explicit description, we might need to consider alternative interpretations or actions within the given constraints. However, based on the goal and typical adventure game logic, placing the broom in the freezer seems the intended next step.\n\nGiven the current information and the goal, if the game does not allow placing the broom in the freezer directly, we might need to explore other interactions or confirm if there's a different way to achieve the goal as intended. If the game environment or rules allow for creative problem-solving"}}]
