Let's reassess the situation based on the current information:\n\nYou are in a pantry with a refrigerator and a freezer. There is a passage to a kitchen here.\n\nGiven that neither a cupboard nor a table is visible in the pantry, we need to consider the logical next steps:\n\n1. **Explore the kitchen**: Since there's a passage to a kitchen, it's likely that a table and a shelf are located there, which would be essential for placing the items as described.\n\n2. **Check the kitchen**: If we assume that the kitchen is the next area to explore, we should look for a table and a shelf there.\n\nLet's proceed with exploring the kitchen:\n\n> go to kitchen\n\nNext actions: place potted plant on table (if found), put orange on table (if found), place book on shelf (if found)<|endoftext|>"}}]
