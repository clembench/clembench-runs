	 I apologize for the confusion. In text adventures, directions like "north," "south," "east," and "west" are used to represent movement towards specific areas of the game environment. Here's a clearer explanation:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **North (N)**: Move in the direction of the top of a map, often towards a colder or more northern area.\\ \tt - **South (S)**: Move in the direction of the bottom of a map, often towards a warmer or more southern area.\\ \tt - **East (E)**: Move in the direction of the right side of the map, often towards a more eastern location.\\ \tt - **West (W)**: Move in the direction of the left side of the map, often towards a more western location.\\ \tt \\ \tt In this scenario:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **East (E)** would mean moving towards the right.\\ \tt - **West (W)** would mean moving towards the left.\\ \tt - **North (N)** would mean moving upwards.\\ \tt - **South (S)** would mean moving downwards.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since you are currently in a kitchen and there's a door to the east (right) and another broom closet to the west (left), **"go west"** means to move to the left, towards the broom closet.\\ \tt \\ \tt If you're still unsure, let's simplify:\\ \tt \\ \tt - **Turn left** (which is the same as **"go west"** in game terms).\\ \tt \\ \tt Next actions: get plate, put plate on dining table\\ \tt \\ \tt You turn left and find yourself in
