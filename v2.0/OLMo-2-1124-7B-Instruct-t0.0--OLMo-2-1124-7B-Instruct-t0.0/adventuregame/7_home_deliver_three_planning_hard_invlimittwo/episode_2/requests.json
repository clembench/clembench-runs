In text adventures, directions like \"north,\" \"south,\" \"east,\" and \"west\" are used to represent movement towards specific areas of the game environment. Here's a clearer explanation:\n\n- **North (N)**: Move in the direction of the top of a map, often towards a colder or more northern area.\n- **South (S)**: Move in the direction of the bottom of a map, often towards a warmer or more southern area.\n- **East (E)**: Move in the direction of the right side of the map, often towards a more eastern location.\n- **West (W)**: Move in the direction of the left side of the map, often towards a more western location.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **East (E)** would mean moving towards the right.\n- **West (W)** would mean moving towards the left.\n- **North (N)** would mean moving upwards.\n- **South (S)** would mean moving downwards.\n\nSince you are currently in a kitchen and there's a door to the east (right) and another broom closet to the west (left), **\"go west\"** means to move to the left, towards the broom closet.\n\nIf you're still unsure, let's simplify:\n\n- **Turn left** (which is the same as **\"go west\"** in game terms).\n\nNext actions: get plate, put plate on dining table\n\nYou turn left and find yourself in"}}]
