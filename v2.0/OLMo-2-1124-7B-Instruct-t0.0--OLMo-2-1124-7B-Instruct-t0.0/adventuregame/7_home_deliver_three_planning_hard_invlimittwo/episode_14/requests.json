In this game, you can interact with objects by using simple commands like \"take,\" \"open,\" \"close,\" \"look at,\" \"read,\" etc. Since there's no explicit command for examining furniture, let's try a different approach.\n\n> look around the living room\n\nNext actions: if a wardrobe is visible, take the plate and place it inside, return to the kitchen to get the broom, continue with tasks. If no wardrobe is found, proceed to the kitchen and then explore other options.<|endoftext|>"}}]
