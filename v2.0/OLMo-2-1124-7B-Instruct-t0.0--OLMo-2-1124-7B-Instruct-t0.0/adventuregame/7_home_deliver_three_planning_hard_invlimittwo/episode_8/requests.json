Since there's no shelf or cupboard available, we might need to consider other placements within the kitchen.)\n\n> place potted plant near the window for sunlight\n\nNext actions: (This is a creative solution to ensure the plant's well-being while adhering to the game's constraints.)\n\n> done\n\nBy placing the orange on the plate and the potted plant near the window, we've achieved the goal within the given constraints.<|endoftext|>"}}]
