In text adventure games, the command \"look\" is typically used to examine your surroundings for items or details. Since we're focusing on placing specific items on the table, let's adjust the approach.\n\nGiven that the wardrobe is empty, we'll proceed with the assumption that the book might be on the bed. Here's a revised plan:\n\n> examine bed\n\nNext actions: if book is found, pick up book and place pillow and book on table, find plate, place plate on table. If no book is found, proceed to look for a plate in the hallway or another room.<|endoftext|>"}}]
