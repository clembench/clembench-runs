If this doesn't work as expected, it might be due to limitations in the game's parser or a misunderstanding of how to interact with the game environment. If you continue to face difficulties, consider checking if there are any hints or instructions provided within the game or its interface for guidance on how to interact effectively.<|endoftext|>"}}]
