You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:49:28.151508", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common five-letter English word, \"apple,\" to establish a baseline guess based on the typical structure of English words.\nguess: apple", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:49:28.151623", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = guava\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:49:28.151748", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:49:31.801741", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'a' is a correct letter but in the wrong position, 'p' is incorrect, both 'p' and 'l' are incorrect positions, and 'e' is incorrect.
