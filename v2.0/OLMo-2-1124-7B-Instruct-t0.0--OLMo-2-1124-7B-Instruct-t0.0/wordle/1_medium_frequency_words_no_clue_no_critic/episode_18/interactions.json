This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:50:05.689540", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common five-letter English word, \"apple,\" to establish a baseline guess based on the typical structure of English words.\nguess: apple", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:50:05.689653", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = verve\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:50:05.689787", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word", "label": "context"}}, {"from": "Player 1 (Guesser)", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-07T14:50:09.381260", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that 'a', 'p', 'p', 'l', and 'e' are not in the target word, while 'e' is in the correct position.
