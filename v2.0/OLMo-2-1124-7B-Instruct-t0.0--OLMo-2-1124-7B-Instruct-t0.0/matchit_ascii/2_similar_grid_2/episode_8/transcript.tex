	 ANSWER: The cell in the center of the third row, which contains a single ▢, does not have any specific color or design compared to the other empty cells (▢) in my grid. The 'X' in my grid is represented by a red cross, typically thicker and more distinct than the empty cells.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
