	 DECISION: different grids\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the descriptions provided, there are discrepancies in the number and positioning of filled and empty squares in the respective grids. For instance, the number of filled squares in the third position of the top row, the number of filled squares consecutively at the end of the third row, and the number and positioning of empty squares in the second and first rows all differ between the two descriptions. These differences suggest that the grids are not the same.
