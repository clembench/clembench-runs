    <div speaker="Player 2 (MatchItPlayer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>ANSWER: My grid exhibits rotational symmetry of order 2. This means that if you rotate the grid 180 degrees around its center, it will look the same. The grid&#x27;s layout is such that each half of the grid, when divided down the middle vertically, mirrors the other half. There are no reflectional, diagonal, or other forms of symmetry present in the grid. It is primarily characterized by its rotational symmetry of order 2.</p>
