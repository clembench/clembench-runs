	 ANSWER: My grid exhibits rotational symmetry of order 2. This means that if you rotate the grid 180 degrees around its center, it will look the same. The grid's layout is such that each half of the grid, when divided down the middle vertically, mirrors the other half. There are no reflectional, diagonal, or other forms of symmetry present in the grid. It is primarily characterized by its rotational symmetry of order 2.

	 Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 DECISION: different grids\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the descriptions provided, while both grids are 3x3 and consist of ▢'s and X's, the specific arrangements and color schemes differ. My grid has a monochromatic black background with black ▢'s and white X's, arranged in a straightforward manner with no additional symbols or patterns. In contrast, your grid has a similar structure but with black ▢'s and X's on a black background, and it includes a specific
