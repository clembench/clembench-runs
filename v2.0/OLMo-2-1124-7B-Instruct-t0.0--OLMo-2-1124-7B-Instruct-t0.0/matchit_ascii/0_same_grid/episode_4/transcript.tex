	 ANSWER: In my grid, the fourth column has one X in the first row, two ▢ symbols in the second row, and one X in the third row. This arrangement differs from the fourth column in your grid, which has one X in the first and third rows and two ▢ symbols in the second row.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 DECISION: different grids\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the detailed descriptions provided for each grid, there are clear differences in the arrangements of Xs and ▢ symbols, particularly in the second and third rows, as well as in the fourth column. These discrepancies indicate that the two grids are not the same.
