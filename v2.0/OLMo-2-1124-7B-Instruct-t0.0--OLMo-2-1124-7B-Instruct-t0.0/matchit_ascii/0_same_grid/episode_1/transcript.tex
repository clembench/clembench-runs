	 ANSWER: There are no filled spaces in the ninth row. This is a change from the previous eight rows, which all contained at least one filled space. The ninth row is unique in this regard.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 DECISION: different grids\\ \tt \\ \tt The differences in the arrangement of filled spaces across the rows indicate that the two grids are not the same. Specifically, the presence or absence of filled spaces in the ninth rows of the grids is inconsistent, suggesting that the overall patterns and configurations of the two grids are distinct.
