It does not have any specific color or shape variation and contrasts with the Xs primarily by its absence of lines, as the Xs are cross shapes.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: The background color of my grid is white, providing a stark contrast to the black Xs. The ▢ symbol, when present in your description, would also contrast against the white background due to its black color. There are no specific rules or instructions associated with the placement of the Xs and the ▢ in my grid that differ from a typical 3x3 grid.
