        <p>DECISION: different grids<br/><br/>The descriptions provided reveal that while both grids have a specific pattern, there are notable differences in the arrangement of filled and empty cells, particularly in the second row. My grid includes a filled cell (▢) in the second row, whereas your grid has three consecutive empty cells (X X X) in the same position.
