        <p>DECISION: different grids<br/><br/>The grids described are different due to the variations in the number and positions of filled and empty squares across the rows. My grid has a specific pattern with alternating filled and empty cells, with deviations in the middle rows, while your grid follows a more consistent alternating pattern with additional deviations in the third row. The differences in the number of filled and empty squares in the rows and their specific positions create unique visual characteristics for each grid, making them distinct from one another.</p>
