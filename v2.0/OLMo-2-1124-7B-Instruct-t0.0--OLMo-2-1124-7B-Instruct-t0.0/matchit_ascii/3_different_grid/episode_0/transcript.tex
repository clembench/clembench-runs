The empty\\ \tt QUESTION: In your grid description, you mentioned that the "▢" symbols create vertical lines that divide the grid into three sections. Could you describe how these vertical lines influence the perception of the grid's orientation or orientation relative to the viewer? Additionally, are there any other elements or features in your grid that might affect the orientation or perspective from which the grid is best viewed? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.

	 ANSWER: The vertical lines created by the "▢" symbols do not significantly alter the orientation of the grid itself, as it remains a standard 3x3 grid. However, they do provide visual cues that help orient the viewer to the structure of the grid, making it easier to understand the arrangement of the "X" and "▢" symbols. There are no other elements or features in the grid that would affect the orientation or perspective; the grid is straightforward and does not require

My grid has "X" symbols in the first and last columns of the first and third rows, with "▢" symbols creating vertical lines in the second and third rows.
