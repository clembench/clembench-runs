	 ANSWER: In my grid, the positions of the Xs in the second row are such that there is an X in the third position, with two ▢s in the first and fourth positions. In the fourth row, the arrangement mirrors the first row, with an X in the first and last positions and two ▢s in the second and third positions. There is no specific rule for the placement of Xs in these rows beyond the mentioned mirroring pattern and the requirement that the middle\\ \tt Now come to a decision.

My grid has a consistent pattern with Xs in the first and last positions of the top and bottom rows, and a ▢ in the middle of the second row, with another ▢ in the middle of the third row. In
