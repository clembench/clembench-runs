The filled squares are clustered together with an empty square in between each pair of filled squares. Specifically, there is one filled square in the middle with an empty square on either side, forming a small cluster of three squares (▢ X ▢) with the X&#x27;s being the empty squares.

    <div speaker="Player 2 (MatchItPlayer) to Game Master" class="msg b-gm" style="">
        <p>ANSWER: In my description, the orientation of the two filled squares and the single empty square in the third row is not uniform. The filled squares are positioned horizontally next to each other, with the empty square directly above them. This means the filled squares form a horizontal line at the bottom of the third row, while the empty square is vertically aligned above this line, creating a staggered pattern where the filled squares are horizontally adjacent and the empty square is vertically above them.</p>
