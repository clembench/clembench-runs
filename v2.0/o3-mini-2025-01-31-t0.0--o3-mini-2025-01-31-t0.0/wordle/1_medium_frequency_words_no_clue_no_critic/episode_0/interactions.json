You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:52:36.941839", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: \"crane\" is a common starting guess in Wordle, covering several common letters including both vowels and consonants.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:52:36.942235", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = squat\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:52:36.942402", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:52:45.044910", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: from the previous feedback we know that only the letter \"a\" is in the target word (but not in the third position) and letters \"c\", \"r\", \"n\", and \"e\" are incorrect.
