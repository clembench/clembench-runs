You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:42:40.450583", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with \"crane\" because it's a common five-letter English word that contains frequently used letters, which can help identify correct letters and positions.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:42:40.450976", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = place\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<yellow> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:42:40.451134", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<yellow> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:42:45.806736", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"a\" and \"e\" are correctly placed in positions 3 and 5, and \"c\" is included but not in the first position.
