You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:09.691119", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, which might give me the most information from the feedback.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:09.691595", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = never\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:09.691758", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:11.891851", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters except \"e\" are marked as incorrect, my next guess will be a word that includes \"e\" and excludes \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" to try to find other correct letters.\nguess: theme"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:11.892566", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = never\nguess = theme\nguess_feedback = t<red> h<red> e<yellow> m<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:11.892731", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> h<red> e<yellow> m<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:48:13.957267", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback still shows \"e\" as correct but in the wrong position, and all other letters are incorrect.
