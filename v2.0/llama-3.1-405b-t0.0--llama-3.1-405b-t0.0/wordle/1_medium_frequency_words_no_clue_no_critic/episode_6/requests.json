You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: I am starting my guess with a common five-letter English word, often found in many contexts and widely known.\nguess: house"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: My next guess will include the letter \"e\" in a different position since it appeared as yellow in the previous feedback, and exclude the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" since they appeared as red.\nguess: fence"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> e<yellow> n<green> c<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: Since the letter \"n\" appeared as green, I will keep it in the same position, and try to utilize the yellow \"e\" in a different position again.
