	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has an X in the 3rd cell of no, the 5th row's 3rd cell is empty, and yes it has X's in the corner cells of the 5th row.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have X's in the 1st and 5th cells of the 3rd row?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
