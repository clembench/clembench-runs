	 ANSWER: Yes, the orientation of my grid is standard, with the top row being the one with all X's and the subsequent rows having increasing empty squares (▢) below it, rather than being rotated 90 degrees or mirrored in any way.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the X's and empty squares (▢) in your grid presented in a monochrome color scheme, with no differences in color, shading, or texture between them, other than the difference in symbol?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
