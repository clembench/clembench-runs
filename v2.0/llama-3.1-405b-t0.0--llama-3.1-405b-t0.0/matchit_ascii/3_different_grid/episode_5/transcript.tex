	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has one completely filled row with X's, the middle row (3rd row) is filled horizontally across the entire row but also only the 3rd row has a completely filled row of X's, however, the 3rd column is also completely filled with X's in all rows, vertically.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the last row and the last column of your grid completely filled with X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
