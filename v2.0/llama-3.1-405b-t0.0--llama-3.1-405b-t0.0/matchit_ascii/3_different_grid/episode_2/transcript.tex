	 ANSWER: The outer columns of my grid are not entirely filled with X's, specifically the first and last columns contain a mix of X's and empty squares, with the top two cells in each column being empty, and the empty squares at the top form two separate rectangular shapes that are symmetrical.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does the rightmost column of your grid contain any X's, aside from possibly the top and bottom row?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
