	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has a single row that contains the most X's, but it is located at the bottom, not the top, and every row in my grid has its X's grouped together in a single block or sequence without any empty squares separating them within that row, specifically the X's are always contiguous and located at the right end of each row.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
