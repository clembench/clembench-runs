	 ANSWER: Yes, the X's and empty squares in my grid are arranged in a perfectly rectangular shape, with all rows and columns having the same width and height, and with no visible distortions.\\ \tt  Yes, my grid uses a monochrome or grayscale-like, or at the least black and white, color scheme represented by  X and symbols.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any subtle or explicit gridlines that separate the individual cells, rows, or columns from each other?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
