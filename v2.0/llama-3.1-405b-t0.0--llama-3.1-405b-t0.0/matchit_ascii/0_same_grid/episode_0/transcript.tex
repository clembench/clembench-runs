	 ANSWER: The X's in my grid are made up of straight lines that intersect at a perfect 90-degree angle, forming a sharp and precise "X" shape.\\ \tt QUESTION: Is the text or symbol size of the X's in your picture the same as the default size I provided in my original grid description, or is it proportionally larger or smaller compared to the size of the grid?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
