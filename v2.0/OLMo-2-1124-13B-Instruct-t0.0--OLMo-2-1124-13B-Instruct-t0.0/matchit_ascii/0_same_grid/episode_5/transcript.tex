	  \tt {\tiny [A$\rangle$GM]}  
	 DECISION: different grids\\ \tt \\ \tt The grids differ in several key aspects. While both grids share the same pattern in the first and fifth rows, the third row in my grid contains five consecutive empty squares ('▢'), which is not the case in your grid. Additionally, your grid lacks a column with all empty squares ('▢'), and it does not have an 'X' in the center position. These differences indicate that the grids are not the same.
