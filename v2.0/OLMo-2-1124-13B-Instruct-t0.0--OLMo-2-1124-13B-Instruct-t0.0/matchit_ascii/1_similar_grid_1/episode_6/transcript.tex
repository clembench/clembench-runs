	 ANSWER: No, the positions of the filled squares in the second row of your grid are not the same as the positions of the empty squares in the second row of my grid. In your grid, the second row has two empty squares (▢) followed by two crosses (X) and one empty square (▢). In my grid, the second row has two crosses (X) followed by two empty squares (▢) and one empty square (▢) at the end\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
