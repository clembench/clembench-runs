What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n\n<|assistant|>\nDECISION: different grids<|endoftext|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 22:46:06.374589", "call_duration": "0:00:00.469941", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "OLMo-2-1124-13B-Instruct"}}}]
