The second row has three Xs and two empty spaces represented by ▢. The third row mirrors the second row with three Xs and two empty spaces in the same positions. The fourth row is identical to the third row, maintaining the pattern of three Xs and two empty spaces.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 5x5 matrix. The pattern is as follows: The first and last rows are identical, each containing three X's and two empty spaces. The second row has one X followed by three empty spaces, then another X. The third and fourth rows are identical, each containing two X's in the middle, surrounded by empty spaces on both sides.\nQUESTION: Are the empty spaces in the second, third, and fourth rows aligned vertically in the same positions as in your description? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: No, the empty spaces in the second, third, and fourth rows of my grid are not aligned vertically in the same positions as in your description. In my grid, the second row has two empty spaces side by side in the middle, with an X on either side. The third and fourth rows mirror this pattern exactly.
