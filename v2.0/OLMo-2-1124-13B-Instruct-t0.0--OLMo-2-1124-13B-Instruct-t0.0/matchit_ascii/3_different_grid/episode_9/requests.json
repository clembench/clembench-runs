The third row has an '\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that are identical to any rows in my grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: No, there are no rows in my grid that are identical to any rows in your grid.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns where 'X' symbols are only present in the middle positions?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has columns where 'X' symbols are only present in the middle positions. Specifically, in the third column, the 'X' is in the third position, and in the fourth column, the 'X' is in the fourth position.\nQUESTION: Are there any columns in your grid where 'X' symbols are only present in the first and last positions?

For example, in the first row, the 'X' in the first position is adjacent to the 'X' in the third position, and in the third row, the 'X' in the third position is adjacent to the 'X' in the fifth position. Similarly, in the second column, the 'X' in the second position is adjacent to the 'X' in\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
