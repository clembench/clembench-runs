	 ANSWER: No specific pattern or shape is formed by the arrangement of 'X's and '▢'s in the second and third rows when viewed together. They are distributed without creating a recognizable shape.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
