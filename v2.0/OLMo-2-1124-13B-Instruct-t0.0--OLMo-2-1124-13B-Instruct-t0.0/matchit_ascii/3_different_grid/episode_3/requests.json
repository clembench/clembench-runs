Specifically, the third row has two filled squares in the first two positions, which means there are two filled squares in the first column.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the filled squares create a symmetrical pattern when viewed horizontally. Specifically, the first and fifth rows are mirror images of each other, and the second and fourth rows also mirror each other.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
