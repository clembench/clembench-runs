Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that have exactly three filled squares (X) and two empty squares (▢) in the exact same positions as the second and fourth rows in my description?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, the second and fourth rows in your description have exactly three filled squares (X) and two empty squares (▢) in the exact same positions.\nQUESTION: Are the filled squares (X) in the second and fourth rows positioned symmetrically around a central empty square (▢)? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: No, the filled squares (X) in the second and fourth rows are not positioned symmetrically around a central empty square (▢). They are aligned in a straight line with the empty squares (▢) on either end.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that have a pattern of one filled square (X), followed by two empty squares (▢), and then another filled square (X), similar to the pattern in the first and fourth rows of my description?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, the first and fourth rows in your description follow the pattern of one filled square (X), followed by two empty squares (▢), and then another filled square (X).\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that have four or more consecutive filled squares (X)? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: No, there are no rows in my grid that have four or more consecutive filled squares (X).<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Does your grid contain any rows that are identical to each other in terms of the arrangement of filled (X) and empty (▢) squares?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: Yes, my grid contains rows that are identical to each other. The first and fourth rows are identical, as are the second and fourth rows in terms of the arrangement of filled (X) and empty (▢) squares.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n\n<|assistant|>\nDECISION: different grids<|endoftext|>"}}]
