In text adventure games, the \"use\" command is often used to interact with items in a specific way. However, since the context of \"use\" can vary widely depending on the game's parser and the items involved, let's clarify the action with the broom and mop:\n\nGiven that the broom and mop are both on the floor, and assuming the game allows for such actions, you might want to:\n\n1. Pick up the broom.\n2. Use the broom to push or move the mop aside.\n\nSince the goal is to clear a path or perform a specific action with these items, let's adjust the plan accordingly:\n\n> pick up the broom\nNext actions: use the broom to move the mop, go to hallway, look for freezer, side table, and table, put the banana in the freezer, the book on the side table, and the plate on the table\n\n> use the broom to move the mop\nNext actions: go to hallway, look for freezer, side table, and table, put the banana in the freezer, the book on the side table, and the plate on the table\n\n> go to hallway\n> look for freezer, side table, and table\n\n> once found, put the banana in the freezer, the book on the side table, and the plate on the table\n> done<|endoftext|>"}}]
