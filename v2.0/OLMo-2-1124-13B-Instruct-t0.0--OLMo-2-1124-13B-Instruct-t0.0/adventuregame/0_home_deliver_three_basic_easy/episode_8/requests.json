The goal is to put the pillow, book, and plate on the table, but since none of these items are mentioned as being in the pantry or accessible from here, we must assume they are located in another room, likely the kitchen.\n\nGiven the pantry's description and the lack of specified items, the logical next step would be to move to a location where these items are accessible. Since the kitchen is mentioned as having a passage from the pantry, it's reasonable to assume the items needed for the goal are there.\n\nLet's proceed with the assumption that the items needed are in the kitchen:\n\n> go kitchen\n\nNow, in the kitchen, we need to locate and gather the pillow, book, and plate to place them on the table. Since the game does not provide immediate access to these items in the kitchen description, we'll have to explore or interact with the environment further to find them. However, without explicit details on what's in the kitchen, we'll have to make educated guesses based on typical adventure game logic:\n\nAssuming the kitchen contains a table and the necessary items:\n\n> look around\n> take pillow\n> take book\n> take plate\n> go to table\n> put pillow"}}]
