Since the cupboard is empty, we need to explore other areas to find items that can be placed on the table.\n\nHere's how you can proceed:\n\n> look around kitchen\n\nThis command will describe the kitchen area in more detail, potentially revealing items that were not initially mentioned.\n\nNext actions: based on the description, take any items found and place them on the table.\n\nIf the kitchen description doesn't reveal any new items:\n\n> go to living room\n> look around living room\n\nNext actions: if items are found in the living room, take them and bring them back to the kitchen to place on the table.\n\nIf the living room also doesn't provide new items:\n\n> go to hallway\n> look around hallway\n\nNext actions: similarly, if items are found in the hallway, take them and bring them back to the kitchen.\n\nIf the hallway doesn't yield new items:\n\n> go to pantry\n> look around pantry\n\nNext actions: if items are found in the pantry, take them and bring them back to the kitchen to place on the table.\n\nIf none of these areas provide items:\n\n> think of another way to achieve the goal\n\nSince the cupboard is empty, we might need to think creatively. Perhaps there's an item in another room that can be used as a substitute for a pillow,"}}]
