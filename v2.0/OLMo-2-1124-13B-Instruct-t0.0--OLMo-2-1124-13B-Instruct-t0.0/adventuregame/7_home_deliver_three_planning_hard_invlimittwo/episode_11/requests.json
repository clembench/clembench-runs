In text adventure games, the \"look\" command is used to examine your surroundings and any objects within them. It often provides a detailed description of what you can see, which can include items you can interact with. Here's how you might proceed more specifically:\n\n> look\n\nThis command will give you a description of the living room. Let's assume the description includes:\n\n- A side table with a book on it.\n- A shelf with no book visible.\n- A kitchen passage with a sandwich on the counter.\n- A hallway with a broom leaning against the wall.\n\nBased on this new information:\n\n> take book from side table\n\nNext actions: if the book is successfully taken, go to the living room table; if the book is not there, check the shelf again or proceed to the kitchen to get the sandwich; if the book is taken, then move to the living room table to place it\n\n> go to living room table\n\nNext actions: place the book on the table; if the book is already placed, proceed to the kitchen to get the sandwich; once both items are secured, head to the appropriate location to place them as per the goal\n\n> go to kitchen\n\nNext actions: take the sandwich from the counter; if the sandwich is not there, return to the living room to check the side table for any missed items; if the sandwich is taken, head back to the living room table to place it with the book\n\n> take"}}]
