In text adventure games, the \"look\" command is used to examine the surroundings or an object more closely. It often provides additional details about the environment or item that weren't initially described. Here's how you might proceed:\n\n> look at table\n\nThis command will give you a more detailed description of the table, possibly revealing items or features that weren't mentioned in the initial description.\n\n> look at side table\n\nThis command will provide a detailed description of the side table, which might include a pillow or other relevant items.\n\n> take pillow if it's on the side table\n\nIf the pillow is indeed on the side table, you would then take it with the \"take\" command. If it's not there, you would continue to look around the room for the pillow.\n\n> look around the room\n\nThis command will allow you to examine the couch, chair, and any other areas of the living room for the pillow.\n\n> head to hallway\n\nOnce you've located the pillow (or determined it's not in the living room), you would move to the hallway with this command.\n\n> look for refrigerator\n\nIn the hallway, you would use this command to search for the refrigerator.\n\n> place pillow in refrigerator\n\nAssuming you've found the refrigerator, you would then put the pillow inside with this command.\n\n> look for wardrobe\n\nYou would use this command to search for the wardrobe.\n\n> place book in wardrobe\n\nAfter finding the wardrobe, you would put the"}}]
