In text adventure games, the \"look\" command is used to examine your surroundings more closely. It often provides additional details about objects, characters, and potential interactions in the environment. Here's how you might proceed with more specific actions:\n\n> look around\n\nNext actions: Based on the description, look for a potted plant, a plate, and a mop or freezer. If a potted plant is visible, take it. If a plate is visible, take it. If a mop or freezer is visible, note their location.\n\n> take potted plant if visible\n\nNext actions: If a potted plant is taken, proceed to the living room side table to place it. If no potted plant is found, continue searching.\n\n> take plate if visible\n\nNext actions: If a plate is taken, head to the kitchen to look for a shelf to place it on. If no plate is found, continue searching for one.\n\n> go to kitchen\n\nNext actions: Once in the kitchen, look for a shelf or a suitable place to put the plate. If a shelf is found, place the plate on it. If no shelf is found, consider other locations like the hallway or bedroom.\n\n> look for a shelf in the kitchen\n\nNext actions: If a shelf is found, place the plate on it. If no shelf is found, continue searching for a suitable place to put the plate.\n\n> place plate on shelf if found\n\nNext actions: If"}}]
