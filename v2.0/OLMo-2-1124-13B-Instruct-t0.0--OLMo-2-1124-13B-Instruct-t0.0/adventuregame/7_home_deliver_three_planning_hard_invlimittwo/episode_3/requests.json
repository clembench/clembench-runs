However, let's adapt the plan to work within the constraints provided:\n\nSince there's no freezer, we'll need to find an alternative way to handle the apple. Perhaps there's a way to store it temporarily or use it in another part of the game. Let's revise our plan:\n\n**Plan Adjustment:**\n\n1. **Handle the Apple:** Since there's no freezer, we'll need to think creatively. One option could be to use the apple in a different context, like giving it to someone or using it in a recipe if that's an option in the game.\n\n2. **Plate on Side Table:** This step remains unchanged. We'll take the plate from the table and place it on the side table.\n\n3. **Mop on Shelf:** This step also remains unchanged. We'll take the mop and place it on the shelf.\n\n**Revised Actions:**\n\n> go to living room\n\nNext actions: take plate from table, go to kitchen, place plate on counter, go to living room, take mop from near chair, go to kitchen, place mop on shelf, go to living room, confirm all items are in place\n\n> take plate from table\n\nNext actions: go to kitchen, place plate on counter, go to living room, take mop from near chair, go to kitchen, place mop on shelf, go to living room"}}]
