In text-based adventure games, the \"use\" command is often used to interact with objects in a specific way, but it can be a bit vague. Since you're new to this, let's simplify the actions using more direct commands:\n\n> take broom\n\nNow you have the broom in your inventory.\n\n> move mop with broom\n\nTo move the mop with the broom, you would typically just state the action directly:\n\n> push mop with broom\n\nNext actions: After moving the mop, you would proceed to the hallway and look for the freezer, side table, and dining table to complete your goal.\n\n> go to hallway\n\nOnce in the hallway:\n\n> look for freezer, side table, and table\n\nUpon finding these items:\n\n> put banana in freezer\n> place book on side table\n> put plate on table\n\nAfter completing these actions:\n\n> done\n\nThis should guide you through the necessary steps to achieve your goal in the text adventure game. Remember, the commands should reflect simple actions like \"put,\" \"place,\" \"take,\" \"go,\" \"look,\" etc., to interact with the environment and objects around you.<|endoftext|>"}}]
