There is a counter with a plate on it, a closed cupboard, and a passage leading to a living room.\"\n- **Specific:** If you want to examine the plate more closely, you could type \"look plate.\" The game might then give you a detailed description of the plate, such as its size,", "label": "response"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-08T09:08:31.871608", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Round: 9"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-08T09:08:31.871643", "action": {"type": "invalid_format", "content": "command_tag_missing"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-05-08T09:08:31.871658", "action": {"type": "game_result", "content": {"goal_states_achieved": [], "game_successfully_finished": false}}}]], "adventure_info": {"variant": "plan", "max_turns": 50, "optimal_turns": 10, "goal_count": 3}}
