	 Okay, I need to help the other player guess the word "troubleshoot" without using the target word or any of the related words like debug, trouble-shoot, or troubleshooting. Let me think about what troubleshooting means. It's about solving problems, fixing issues, maybe in a system or machine. So I should focus on actions like solving problems, finding solutions, fixing errors.\\ \tt \\ \tt First clue: Maybe something like "Find and fix issues in a system." But wait, does that use any
