Let me think about synonyms or related concepts. \"Rough\" can mean something that's not smooth, maybe like sandpaper? Or maybe something that's uneven in texture. Wait, but I can't mention \"texture\" because that's close to \"sensation\"? Hmm, the related words include \"sensation,\"", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:44:06.508803", "call_duration": "0:00:06.495615", "response": "Okay, I need to help the other player guess the word \"rough\" without using the word itself or any of the related words: ciliated, sensation, or roughish.
