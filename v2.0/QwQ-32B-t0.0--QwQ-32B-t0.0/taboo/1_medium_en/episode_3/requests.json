Let's think.\n\nFirst, \"nelson\" is a type of wrestling hold, but I can't mention any of those words. Hmm. Maybe describe the action or the body part involved.

So maybe something like \"a move that twists the arm behind the back and under the head\"?", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:43:59.992069", "call_duration": "0:00:06.469324", "response": "Okay, I need to help the other player guess the word \"nelson\" without using the target word or the related words: hold, nell, wrestling.
