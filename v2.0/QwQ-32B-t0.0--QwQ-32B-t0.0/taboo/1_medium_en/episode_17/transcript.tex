	 Okay, I need to describe the word "dozen" without using the word itself, "12", "twelve", or "hundredweight". Let's think. A dozen is a group of 12 items. So maybe mention grouping or a common quantity. Eggs often come in dozens. But I can't say 12 or twelve. Maybe "a common grouping of items like eggs" but that uses "grouping". Alternatively, "a standard set of twelve" but
