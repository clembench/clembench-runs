	 Okay, I need to help the other player guess the word "int" without using "int" or any of the related words: rpg, intelligence, programming. Let me think about what "int" could stand for. Oh right, in programming, "int" is a data type for integer. But I can't mention programming. Hmm. The related words include "programming" so I have to avoid that. Maybe I can refer to numbers or whole numbers? Or something about coding without
