	 Okay, the target word is "pool." The related words are "swiming," "group," and "Swimming." I need to make sure not to use any of those. Let's think about synonyms or related concepts. "Pool" can refer to a swimming pool, but I can't mention swimming. Maybe focus on the physical structure? Like a rectangular water-filled area. Or maybe the activity people do there, but without using swim-related terms. Alternatively, "pool" can also mean
