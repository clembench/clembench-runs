I need to describe it without using \"fort\" or any related words like \"meet\", \"garrison\", or \"fortify\". Let's think about what a fort is. It's a fortified structure, usually for defense. Maybe mention walls, military, or protection. But I can't say \"fortify\". Maybe \"a protected place where soldiers stay\"? Wait, \"garrison\" is related, so I can't use that either.
