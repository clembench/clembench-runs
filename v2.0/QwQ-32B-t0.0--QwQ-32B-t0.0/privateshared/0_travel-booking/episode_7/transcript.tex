	 Okay, the user is asking if the travel agent knows where they're leaving from. Let me check the details provided. The user mentioned their trip is from London to Madrid by train in economy next month's first week. The agent hasn't been informed yet. The question is whether the agent would know the departure city. Since the agent doesn't know about the travel details yet, the answer should be no. But wait, the user is simulating a scenario where they're the customer. The user
