	 Okay, the user is asking if the questioner knows what's on my left. Let me check the setup again. The positions are defined with LEFT being carbon. The questioner's knowledge is supposed to be unknown because "things are in different places, but the questioner does not know about it yet." The user's question is phrased as "ME: Does the questioner know what is on your left?" Since the scenario states the questioner doesn't know the positions yet, the
