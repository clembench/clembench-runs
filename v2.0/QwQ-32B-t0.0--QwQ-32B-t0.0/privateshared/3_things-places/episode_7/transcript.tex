The items are placed in different directions, and the questioner doesn't know about their locations yet. The LEFT is assigned to a paintbrush. But the question is whether the questioner knows this. The initial instruction says "Things are in different places, but the questioner does not know about it yet." So the answer should be no. The user's question is to confirm

The items are placed in different directions, but the note says "the questioner does not know about it yet." The positions like LEFT: paintbrush are part of the scenario the questioner is supposed to figure out. So the questioner doesn't have that knowledge yet.
