	 Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user set up a scenario where different items are located in various directions and positions. The question is whether the questioner knows what's on "my" left. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to clarify the perspective. The setup lists items under directions like LEFT: cherry, RIGHT: lip gloss, etc. The questioner is asking if they (the questioner) know what's on the left.
