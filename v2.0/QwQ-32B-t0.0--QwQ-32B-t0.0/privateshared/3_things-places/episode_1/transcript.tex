	 Okay, the user is asking if the questioner knows what's on my left. Let me check the setup again. The positions are given with LEFT being daisy. The questioner's knowledge is supposed to be unknown since the prompt says "Things are in different places, but the questioner does not know about it yet." So the questioner doesn't know the locations. The user's question is whether the questioner knows the left item. Since the questioner is supposed to be unaware,
