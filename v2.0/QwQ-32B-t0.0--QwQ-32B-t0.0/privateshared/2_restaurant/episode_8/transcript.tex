The user provided their order, including Bruschetta as the appetizer, but the note says the waiter doesn't know yet. The question is from the user, so I need to answer with "ASIDE: no" since the waiter hasn't been told yet. Just need to confirm that the appetizer is mentioned but the waiter is unaware. Yep, the answer

The user wants a direct answer, so just "no" followed by stopping. Make sure not to add any extra information
