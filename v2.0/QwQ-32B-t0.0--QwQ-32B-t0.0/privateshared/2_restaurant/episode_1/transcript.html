        <p>Okay, the user wants me to determine if the waiter is aware of their appetizer choice. The user provided their order, which includes Antipasti as the appetizer. The scenario says the waiter doesn&#x27;t know yet. The question is asking if the waiter is aware. Since the setup clearly states the waiter isn&#x27;t aware, the answer should be no.
