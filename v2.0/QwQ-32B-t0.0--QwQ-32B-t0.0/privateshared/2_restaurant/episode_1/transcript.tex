The user provided their order, including Antipasti as the appetizer, but the note says the waiter doesn't know yet. The question is from the user, so I need to answer with "ASIDE: no" since the waiter hasn't been informed yet. Just need to confirm that the appetizer is listed and the waiter is unaware.
