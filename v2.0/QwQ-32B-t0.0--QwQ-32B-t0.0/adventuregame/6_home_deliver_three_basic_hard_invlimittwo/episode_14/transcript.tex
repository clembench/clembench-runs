	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the broom on the shelf, the potted plant on the counter, and the plate in the wardrobe. But first, I need to figure out where all these items are. The current room is the living room with a couch, book, side table, and chair. The book is on the side table. The passages lead to hallway, kitchen, and bedroom.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the problem is I don't see the broom, potted plant
