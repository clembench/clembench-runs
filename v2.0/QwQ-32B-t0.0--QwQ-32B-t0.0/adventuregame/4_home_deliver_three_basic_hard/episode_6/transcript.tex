	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the sandwich on the side table, the book on the shelf, and the mop in the cupboard. First, I should figure out where each item is right now. The user mentioned being in a kitchen with a cupboard and a counter. The cupboard is closed, so maybe the mop is inside? Wait, but the goal is to put the mop in the cupboard, so maybe it's not there yet. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt The sandwich and book might be on
