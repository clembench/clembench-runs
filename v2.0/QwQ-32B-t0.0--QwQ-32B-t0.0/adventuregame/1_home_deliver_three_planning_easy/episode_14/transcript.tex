	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Write your plan for your next actions on the line below your action, starting with "Next actions:".\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt Next actions: take orange, eat orange\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the pillow on the table, the book on the table and the plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a book, a shelf, a side table and a chair. The book is on the side table. There are passages to a hallway, a kitchen and a bedroom here.

	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the pillow, book, and plate on the table. First, the book is already on the side table, so maybe that's one of the items? Wait, the goal says the book should be on the table. Wait, the side table is part of the living room. Hmm, maybe the side table is the table they're referring to? Or is there another table? The problem says "the table" so maybe there's only one table
