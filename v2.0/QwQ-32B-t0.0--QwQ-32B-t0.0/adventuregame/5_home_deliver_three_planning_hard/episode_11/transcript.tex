	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the book on the shelf, the sandwich on the table, and the broom on the counter. First, I should figure out where each item is currently. The living room has a couch, shelf, side table, and chair. The passages lead to hallway, kitchen, and bedroom.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the shelf is already here, so maybe the book is somewhere else. The sandwich might be on the table, but the goal says to put it there
