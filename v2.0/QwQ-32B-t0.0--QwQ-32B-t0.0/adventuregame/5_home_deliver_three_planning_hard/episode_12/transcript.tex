	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Write your plan for your next actions on the line below your action, starting with "Next actions:".\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt Next actions: take orange, eat orange\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the pillow in the freezer, the broom on the bed and the plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a hallway now. There is a potted plant. The potted plant is on the floor. There are passages to a living room, a broom closet and a kitchen here.

	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the pillow in the freezer, the broom on the bed, and the plate on the table. First, I should figure out where each of these items is located. The user mentioned being in a hallway with a potted plant on the floor. The available rooms are the living room, broom closet, and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt The broom is probably in the broom closet, right? So I should go there first. Let me check that.
