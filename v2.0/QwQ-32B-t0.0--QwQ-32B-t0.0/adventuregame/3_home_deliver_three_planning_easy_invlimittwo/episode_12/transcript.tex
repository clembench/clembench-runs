	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the pillow, book, and plate all on the table. But first, I should figure out where each item is. The description says I'm in a kitchen with a cupboard, a plate, and a counter. The plate is already on the counter. Wait, but the goal is to put the plate on the table. So maybe the table isn't mentioned here. Hmm, maybe the table is in another room? Or maybe I need to move
