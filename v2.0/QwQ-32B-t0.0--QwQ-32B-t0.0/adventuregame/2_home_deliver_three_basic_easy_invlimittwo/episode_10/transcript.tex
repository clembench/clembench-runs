	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the pillow on the table, the book on the table and the plate on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a book, a shelf, a side table and a chair. The book is on the side table. There are passages to a hallway, a kitchen and a bedroom here.

	 Okay, let's see. I need to put the pillow, book, and plate on the table. First, the book is already on the side table, so maybe that's one of the tables mentioned. Wait, the goal says "the table"â€”are there multiple tables? The living room has a side table, so maybe that's the one. But the pillow and plate aren't here. The couch and chair might have the pillow. Let me check.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should probably start by looking around
