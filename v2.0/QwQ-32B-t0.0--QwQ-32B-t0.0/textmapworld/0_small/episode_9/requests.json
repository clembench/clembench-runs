The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point.

To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

I need to figure out the path through the rooms starting from the Gallery, moving east first. The goal is to visit all rooms with as few room changes as possible. Hmm, so I should probably use a strategy like depth-first search but try to cover as much as possible without backtracking too much. Wait, but the problem says to use the fewest number of moves, so maybe a greedy approach where each move leads to a new room if possible.\n\nStarting in", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:54:23.434012", "call_duration": "0:00:06.474576", "response": "Okay, let's see.
