The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: west.

I need to figure out the path through the rooms with the fewest room changes. The user starts in the Guest room, and the only direction available is west. So first move must be GO: west. Let's say that takes them to the next room. But I need to track all visited rooms and make sure I don't loop. Since the example ended when there were no new rooms, I should use a strategy that explores all possible paths without backtracking unnecessarily"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-18T22:53:30.670066", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
