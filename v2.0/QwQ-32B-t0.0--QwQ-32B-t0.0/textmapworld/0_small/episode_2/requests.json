I need to figure out the path through the rooms starting from the Pantry, trying to visit all rooms with as few room changes as possible. The goal is to minimize the number of steps, so I should probably use a strategy like depth-first search but maybe optimized for fewest moves. Wait, actually, the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible,\" which I think means the least number of steps. So I need to find the shortest path that covers", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:53:37.565637", "call_duration": "0:00:06.491477", "response": "Okay, let's see.
