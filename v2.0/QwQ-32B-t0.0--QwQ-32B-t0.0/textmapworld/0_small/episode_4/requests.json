The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

I need to figure out the path through all the rooms with the fewest room changes. The user starts in the Home gym, and the only direction available is west. So first move has to be west. Let me note that down.\n\nAfter going west, they end up in the next room.
