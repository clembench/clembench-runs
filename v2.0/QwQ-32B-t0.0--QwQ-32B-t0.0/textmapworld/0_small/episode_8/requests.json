The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

I need to figure out the path through all the rooms with the fewest room changes. The goal is to visit every room and then stop when there are no new ones left. The example they gave uses a sort of depth-first approach, but maybe I should think of it as trying to cover all rooms efficiently.\n\nStarting in the Laundry room.
