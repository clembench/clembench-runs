The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So I need to find a path that covers every room without backtracking more than necessary. The example given uses a straightforward approach, moving in a direction until there are no new rooms left. \n\nStarting in the Studio, the only available direction is north. So first move north. Let's say that takes me to the next room.
