To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

I need to figure out the path through all the rooms with the fewest room changes. The user starts in the Game room, and the only direction available is south. So first move has to be GO: south.
