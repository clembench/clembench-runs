	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next command?

	 Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the path through the rooms starting from the Cellar, trying to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. The directions given here are south and east. Hmm, the goal is to minimize the number of room changes, so I should probably take the path that leads to the most unvisited rooms first. But since I don't know the layout yet, I have to explore systematically.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Cellar. The first move could be
