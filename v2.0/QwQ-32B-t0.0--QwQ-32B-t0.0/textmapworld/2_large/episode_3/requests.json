I need to figure out the path through all the rooms with the fewest room changes. The goal is to visit every room and then stop when there are no new ones left. The starting point is the Wine cellar with directions west and east. Hmm, I should probably start by choosing one direction first, maybe west, to explore that path. But I need to keep track of where I've been to avoid loops. Wait, but how do I know which direction leads", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:55:54.804640", "call_duration": "0:00:06.486382", "response": "Okay, let's see.
