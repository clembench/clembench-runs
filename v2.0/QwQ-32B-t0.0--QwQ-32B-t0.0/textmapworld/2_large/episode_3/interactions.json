The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

But I need to keep track of where I've been to avoid loops. Wait, but how do I know which direction leads"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-18T22:56:01.291199", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": "abort game"}}]]}
