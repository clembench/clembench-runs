I need to figure out the path through the rooms starting from the Library, trying to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. The directions given here are west and north. Hmm, the first step is to choose a direction. Since I want to explore as much as possible, maybe I should pick one direction first and see where it goes. Let me think of this as a graph traversal problem. Probably a depth-first search (DFS) approach would work here,", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-03-18 22:56:14.355026", "call_duration": "0:00:06.476722", "response": "Okay, let's see.
