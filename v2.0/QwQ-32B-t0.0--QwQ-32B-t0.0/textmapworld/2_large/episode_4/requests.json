The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

I need to figure out the path through all the rooms with the fewest room changes. The goal is to visit every room and then stop when there are no new ones left. The starting point is the Home theater, and the available directions are south and north. Hmm, I should probably choose one direction first. Let me think of this as a graph where each room is a node and the directions are edges.
