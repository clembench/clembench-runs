I need to figure out the path through the rooms with the fewest room changes. The user starts in the Closet and can only go west. So first move must be GO: west. Let's say that takes them to the next room. Then, in each subsequent room, I have to choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms, right? The goal is to visit all rooms with as few steps as possible.
