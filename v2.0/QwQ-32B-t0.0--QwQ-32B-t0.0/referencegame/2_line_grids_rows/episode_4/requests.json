I need to describe the target grid in a way that clearly distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let me start by analyzing each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid is a 5x5 grid where each row has three X's in the middle three columns. So every row is \"▢ X X X □\". That means the X's form a solid rectangle in the center, spanning all five rows but only three columns.
