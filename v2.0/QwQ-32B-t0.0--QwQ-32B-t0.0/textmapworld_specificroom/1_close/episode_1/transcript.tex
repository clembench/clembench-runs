	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south.

	 Okay, let's see. The target is the Library, and I'm starting in the Basement. The available directions from here are east, north, and south. Hmm, I need to figure out which way to go first. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to keep track of the rooms I visit. Maybe I should try going north first? But wait, sometimes in these kinds of puzzles, the target might be in a different direction. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt If I go
