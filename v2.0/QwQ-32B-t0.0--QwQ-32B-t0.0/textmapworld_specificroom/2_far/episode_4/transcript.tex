	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Closet. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Okay, let's see. The target room is the Closet, and I'm starting in the Bedroom with only the north direction available. So first, I need to go north. Let me write that down: GO: north.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, after moving north, the user would tell me the new room and available directions. But since I don't have that info yet, I have to assume the next step. Wait, actually, the user will provide the feedback after each move. Oh right, the
