The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target is the Laundry room, and I'm starting in the Bar with only the west direction available. So first move has to be west.

But since I don't have that info yet, I'll just proceed step by step.
