You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:32:47.383333", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with \"table\", a common five-letter English word that uses frequently occurring letters.\nguess: table"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:32:47.383790", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = month\nguess = table\nguess_feedback = t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:32:47.383936", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:32:48.666955", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback shows that \"t\" is in the word but not in the first position, and the other letters are not present.
