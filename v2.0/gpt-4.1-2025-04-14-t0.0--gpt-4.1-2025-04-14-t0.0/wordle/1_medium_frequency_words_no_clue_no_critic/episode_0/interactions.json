You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:33:49.462611", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: this is a common five-letter English word with a good mix of vowels and consonants, useful for gathering information about letter positions.\nguess: table"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:33:49.463076", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = squat\nguess = table\nguess_feedback = t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:33:49.463216", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-15T08:33:51.000224", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: \"t\" and \"a\" are in the word but not in the correct positions; \"b\", \"l\", and \"e\" are not in the word.
