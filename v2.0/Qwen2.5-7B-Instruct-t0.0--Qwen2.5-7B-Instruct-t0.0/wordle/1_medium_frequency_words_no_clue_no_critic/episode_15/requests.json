You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Starting with a common five-letter word that often appears in word games, I choose \"crane\".\nguess: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'r' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'e' is correct but in the wrong position. The letters 'c', 'a', and 'n' are incorrect. This means the target word does not contain 'c', 'a', or 'n'. I will now focus on letters that are either yellow or not present in the feedback, such as 'r' and 'e', and try to place them correctly.\nguess: treeb<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game.

Since 'r' and 'e' are the only letters from the previous guess that received yellow feedback, and they are not part of 'treeb', I will construct a new guess focusing on 'r' and 'e' while ensuring it is a valid word.
