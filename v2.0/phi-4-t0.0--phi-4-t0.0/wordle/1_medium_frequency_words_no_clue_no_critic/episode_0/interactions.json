You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T20:59:25.995722", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants, which can help identify the presence and position of these letters in the target word.\nguess: crane\n\n---\n\nOnce I receive feedback, I'll use it to refine my next guess.<|im_end|>"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T20:59:25.995971", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The response should contain only the 'guess:' and 'explanation:' keywords and associated information."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T20:59:25.996053", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 1, "Complete turns": 0, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1], "Parsed Request Count": [0], "Violated Request Count": [1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "squat", "target_word_clue": "play catcher, say", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [], "guess_explanation": [], "critic_feedback": {}}}
