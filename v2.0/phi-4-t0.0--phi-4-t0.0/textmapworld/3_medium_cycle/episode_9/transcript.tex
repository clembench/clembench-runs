	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Gallery. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next command?

	 To achieve the goal of visiting all rooms with the fewest number of room changes, we need to explore systematically. Here's a step-by-step approach:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. **Start in the Gallery**: \\ \tt    - Available directions: west, east.\\ \tt    - Choose one direction to explore first. Let's go east.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. **Move to the next room**:\\ \tt    - GO: east\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. **Continue exploring**:\\ \tt    - From each new room, choose a direction that leads to an
