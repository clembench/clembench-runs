The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in.

To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.
