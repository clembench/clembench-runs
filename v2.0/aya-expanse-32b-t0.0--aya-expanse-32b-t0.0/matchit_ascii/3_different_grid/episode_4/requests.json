Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>ANSWER: Yes, there is a distinct rectangle of empty squares in the center of my grid.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>QUESTION: Are the X's in your grid evenly distributed across the entire grid, or are they concentrated in certain areas?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>ANSWER: The X's in my grid are concentrated in the middle, forming a cross, with no X's in the corners or on the edges.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>DECISION: different grids<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 22:33:08.790083", "call_duration": "0:00:00.535434", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "aya-expanse-32b"}}}]
