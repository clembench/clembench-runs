The bottom row has two Xs, while the other rows have one X each. Similarly, the leftmost column has two Xs, and the other columns have one X each.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
