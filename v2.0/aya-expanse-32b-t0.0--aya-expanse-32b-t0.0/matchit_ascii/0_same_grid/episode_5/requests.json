No diagonal or vertical elements.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>DECISION: different grids<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 22:21:32.954449", "call_duration": "0:00:00.528021", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "aya-expanse-32b"}}}]
