The top row is filled with X, and the rest of the grid has a descending pattern of X and ▢, with the number of ▢ increasing in each row.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>This is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x4 grid with a pattern of squares and empty spaces. The pattern starts with a solid row of X's at the top, followed by four rows of decreasing length, each starting with one more empty space than the previous row.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a symmetrical pattern when viewed from left to right? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>ANSWER: No, the pattern is not symmetrical due to the increasing number of ▢ symbols in each row.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>QUESTION: Are all the rows in your grid the same length?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>ANSWER: Yes, all the rows in my grid are of the same length.\nQUESTION: Is there a consistent number of X's in each row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>ANSWER: No, the number of X's in each row varies, decreasing by one in each subsequent row.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>QUESTION: Does your grid have any rows with all ▢ (empty spaces) or all X's?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>ANSWER: No, there are no rows with all ▢ or all X's in my grid. Each row contains a combination of both symbols.\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid always arranged in a straight line within each row? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>ANSWER: Yes, the X's in my grid are always arranged in a straight line within each row.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

There are more X's than ▢ symbols.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
