Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>QUESTION: Is the pattern of 'X' marks in your grid symmetrical in any way (e.g., vertically, horizontally, or diagonally)?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>ANSWER: Yes, the pattern of 'X' marks in my grid is vertically symmetrical.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
