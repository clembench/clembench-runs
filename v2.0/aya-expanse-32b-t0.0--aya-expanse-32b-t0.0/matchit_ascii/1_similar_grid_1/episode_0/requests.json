The top-left and bottom-right corners have a single square marked 'X'. The top-right and bottom-left corners have two adjacent squares marked 'X'. The center of the grid has a 3x3 square marked '▢' (empty space).<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>This is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with an H-shaped pattern of X's, where the horizontal bars of the H are in the second and fourth rows, and the vertical bar is in the center column.
