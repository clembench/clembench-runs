	 ANSWER: No, there are no positions in the grid where the 'X's form a continuous path or shape that is not present in your grid. Both grids have the same arrangement of 'X's.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
