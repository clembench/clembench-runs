It has 'X' characters forming a pattern that includes two diagonal lines from top-left to bottom-right and one vertical line from left to right through the middle column. There are also several empty spaces ('□') scattered throughout the grid, creating a checkerboard-like appearance with some additional empty spaces filling in the gaps between the 'X's.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. It contains 'X' characters and an empty space represented by '▢'. The pattern appears to be symmetric along both the vertical and horizontal axes. There are four 'X's in the first row, two 'X's in the second row, five '▢'s in the third row, two 'X's in the fourth row, and four 'X's in the fifth row. The middle column has three 'X's\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Additionally, there are several '▢'s that create a checkerboard-like appearance, with some extra '▢'s filling in the gaps between the 'X's.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any symmetries, such as being symmetric along the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal axes?
