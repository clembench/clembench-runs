The fifth row contains five consecutive 'X's.\nQUESTION: Is there any difference in the number of 'X's between the first and second rows? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, there is a difference in the number of 'X's between the first and second rows. The first row has 1 'X', while the second row has 4 'X's.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
