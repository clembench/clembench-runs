Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nI I I ▢ I\n▢ ▢ I ▢ ▢\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nI I ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put an E in fourth row first column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put an E in fifth row first column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: Put an E in fifth row second column<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nCommand: DONE<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-30 17:35:35.174283", "call_duration": "0:00:00.156448", "response": "Command: DONE", "model_name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct"}}}]
