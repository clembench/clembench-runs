Let me see if I can find a few more options:\n\n15. \"Adult\" could connect:\n    - sex (adult activity)\n    - apartment (adult living situation)\n    - woman (adult female)\n    - information (adult information)\n\n\"Adult\" seems to have fewer connections to opponent/distractor words.\n\nConsidering all options, I think \"residence\" is a good choice as it connects to at least 3 words (apartment, street, dinner) without obvious connections to opponent/distractor words.\n\n\"Adult\" is also a good choice, connecting to 4 words (sex, apartment, woman, information).\n\nI think I'll go with \"residence\" as it has fewer potential connections to opponent/distractor words while still connecting to several team words.\n\nCLUE: RESIDENCE\nTARGETS: apartment, street, dinner", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "CLUE: RESIDENCE\nTARGETS: apartment, street, dinner", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 374, "output_tokens": 1429}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 12:58:49.050807", "call_duration": "0:00:20.930383", "response": "CLUE: RESIDENCE\nTARGETS: apartment, street, dinner", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-25T12:59:17.281191", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 3 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'residence'.
