Afterworld - relates to the concept of an existence after death, a spiritual realm\n2. Probability - relates to likelihood, statistics, chance\n3. Existentialism - philosophy about existence, meaning, choice\n4. Bonkers - crazy, mad, wild\n5. Ungodliness - lack of godliness, impiety, sinfulness\n6. Heyday - prime time, golden era, peak\n7. Imposition - forcing something on someone, burden\n8. Cunningness - being clever, crafty, sly\n9. Ambivalence - having mixed feelings, uncertainty\n\nPotential thematic groupings:\n\nPhilosophy/Belief:\n- afterworld\n- existentialism\n- ungodliness\n\nTime/State:\n- heyday\n- probability (as in states of being)\n\nMental state:\n- bonkers\n- ambivalence\n- cunningness\n\nLet me consider some potential clue words:\n\n\"Philosophy\" - connects to existentialism, afterworld, maybe ungodliness\n\"Belief\" - connects to existentialism, afterworld, ungodliness\n\"Mind\" - connects to existentialism, bonkers, cunningness, ambivalence\n\"Chaos\" - could relate to bonkers, probability, existentialism, ambivalence\n\"Metaphysics\" - relates to afterworld, existentialism, probability\n\"Soul\" - connects to afterworld, existentialism, ungodliness\n\nLet me check these against opponent and distractor words to avoid unintended connections:\n\nOpponent words: desirability, endlessness, extent, atonement, misconception, volition, humbug, dissolution\n\nDistractor words: uselessness, readiness, synthesis, misperception, perpetration, materialism, pacifism\n\nKill word: steadfastness\n\n\"Philosophy\" might connect to materialism (distractor)\n\"Belief\" might connect to misconception, humbug (opponent)\n\"Mind\" might connect to volition (opponent)\n\"Chaos\" might connect to dissolution (opponent)\n\"Metaphysics\" might connect to materialism (distractor)\n\"Soul\" might connect to atonement (opponent)\n\nLet me try a different approach. What about:\n\n\"Uncertainty\" - connects to probability, ambivalence, existentialism\nBut this might connect to misconception (opponent)\n\n\"Mortality\" - connects to afterworld, existentialism, ungodliness\nThis seems safer from opponent words\n\n\"Absurdity\" - connects to bonkers, existentialism, maybe ungodliness\nThis might be a good one with fewer connections to opponent words\n\n\"Paradox\" - connects to probability, existentialism, ambivalence\nMight connect to misconception (opponent)\n\n\"Essence\" - connects to existentialism, afterworld, perhaps heyday\nCould connect to extent (opponent)\n\nI think \"mortality\" or \"absurdity\" are the strongest candidates that connect multiple team words while avoiding opponent words.\n\nLet's go with \"absurdity\" as it connects to:\n1. bonkers (direct connection - absurd means crazy/bonkers)\n2. existentialism (philosophical concept of absurdism is related)\n3. ambivalence (holding contradictory views can be seen as absurd)\n4. cunningness (crafty plans can be absurdly complex)\n\nActually, I should make sure \"absurdity\" doesn't connect to any opponent or distractor words:\n- desirability - not really connected\n- endlessness - not directly connected\n- extent - not connected\n- atonement - not connected\n- misconception - possibly connected but weak\n- volition - not connected\n- humbug - possibly connected but weak\n- dissolution - not directly connected\n- uselessness - not directly connected\n- readiness - not connected\n- synthesis - not connected\n- misperception - possibly connected but weak\n- perpetration - not connected\n- materialism - not directly connected\n- pacifism - not connected\n- steadfastness (kill word) - opposite of absurdity, so not connected\n\n\"Absurdity\" has some weak connections to opponent words, but seems reasonably safe.
