You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: match, ham, australia, strike, boom, germany, ray, moon, eagle.\nYour opponent's team words are: pistol, cold, oil, czech, kiwi, dance, pitch, draft.\nDistractor words are: stick, spike, washer, carrot, duck, hook, link, lion.\nThe kill words are: ."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01LewBGSmtAvUPXcP8Byiij3", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAO75BFwIHV/D58/gtPZRXcg96hAt3OUdEPaiTw7rv3qQb+pa7tYyve3ZZx8lDEo6cVnuflb4HfbS2swVLmfxKWRIMKIzWA4kpk0WTc5+SGgxrPWvXOjIO68szKD8iMAnMHxPy4/VYEkjQNCkxLkqDlFje7+VsZpplkV9C/pp9XhworLCHtbmOaDmNEQZdVCpQXXEbr5c9+Ymn8Hj2CVOPeFyTq/WcXNwrpgzVUR8pGXlEvvaod4G/cirBO3xfdExUWEBczby/qpjt1cO0WKXdkeVUJ104CxozWCoD6o6Qfec=", "thinking": "Let me analyze the word lists and find semantic relationships:\n\nOur team's words:\n1. match: could refer to a flame/fire, a game/competition, a pairing\n2. ham: a type of meat, a radio amateur\n3. australia: a country in Oceania\n4. strike: hit something, labor stoppage, bowling term\n5. boom: loud noise, economic prosperity, part of sailing equipment\n6. germany: a country in Europe\n7. ray: beam of light, type of fish, mathematical concept\n8. moon: celestial body, satellite of Earth\n9. eagle: bird, golf term, symbol\n\nOpponent's words:\n1. pistol: a handgun\n2. cold: low temperature, illness\n3. oil: lubricant, petroleum product\n4. czech: relating to Czech Republic\n5. kiwi: fruit, bird, New Zealander\n6. dance: rhythmic movement\n7. pitch: throw, musical note, sales presentation\n8. draft: preliminary version, conscription, air current\n\nDistractor words:\n1. stick: wooden object, adhere to something\n2. spike: sharp point, sudden increase\n3. washer: cleaning device, metal ring\n4. carrot: vegetable, incentive\n5. duck: bird, to lower quickly\n6. hook: curved device for catching, musical element\n7. link: connection, segment of chain\n8. lion: large cat, astrological sign\n\nLet me look for possible connections between our team's words:\n\n1. Countries: australia, germany\n2. Space/Celestial: moon, ray (as in ray of light from celestial bodies), eagle (as in \"Eagle has landed\" Apollo reference)\n3. Fire/Energy: match, strike, boom\n4. Animals: eagle, ham (from pig)\n5. Sports terms: match (competition), strike (bowling), eagle (golf)\n\nI need to find a clue word that connects as many of our team words as possible without connecting to opponent or distractor words.\n\nLet me consider some possible clue words:\n\n1. \"Countries\" - connects australia and germany, but not many others\n2. \"Space\" - connects moon, ray, eagle (space mission)\n3. \"Fire\" - connects match, strike, boom\n4. \"Sports\" - connects match, strike, eagle\n5. \"Flight\" - could connect eagle, moon (space flight), ray (flying through air), boom (sonic boom from aircraft)\n6. \"Apollo\" - connects moon (moon landing), eagle (lunar lander name), ray (sunlight), but might be too specific\n7. \"Flag\" - connects australia, germany (national flags), eagle (on some flags)\n8. \"Global\" - connects australia, germany (global nations), moon (orbits globe)\n9. \"National\" - connects australia, germany, eagle (national symbol)\n\nLet me check each of these for possible connections to opponent or distractor words:\n\n\"Countries\" - could connect to czech (opponent word)\n\"Space\" - probably safe\n\"Fire\" - might connect to \"oil\" (flammable)\n\"Sports\" - might connect to \"pitch\" (baseball), \"draft\" (sports draft)\n\"Flight\" - might connect to \"duck\" (flies)\n\"Apollo\" - probably safe\n\"Flag\" - probably safe\n\"Global\" - probably safe\n\"National\" - might connect to \"czech\" (nation)\n\nLet me try a different approach and look for less obvious connections among more of our words:\n\n\"Mission\" could connect:\n- moon (moon mission)\n- eagle (Apollo 11 Eagle lander)\n- ray (mission equipment)\n- australia (mission stations)\n- germany (mission history)\n- boom (economic boom from space race)\n\n\"Olympic\" could connect:\n- australia (host country)\n- germany (host country)\n- eagle (symbol)\n- match (Olympic matches)\n- strike (bowling)\n\n\"Power\" could connect:\n- boom (power boom)\n- ray (power ray)\n- strike (power strike)\n- match (power match)\n- germany (power nation)\n- australia (power nation)\n- eagle (symbol of power)\n\nFrom these options, I think \"mission\" has the most connections to our team's words without obvious connections to opponent or distractor words. It can reasonably connect to moon, eagle, ray, australia, germany, and potentially boom.\n\nMy clue and targets would be:\n\nCLUE: MISSION\nTARGETS: moon, eagle, ray, australia, germany, boom\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The word \"mission\" might potentially connect to \"draft\" (mission draft) from the opponent's words.\n\nLet me try another clue:\n\n\"Sky\" could connect:\n- moon (in the sky)\n- eagle (flies in sky)\n- ray (sun rays in sky)\n- boom (thunder in sky)\n- australia (southern sky)\n- germany (northern sky)\n\nThis seems less likely to connect to opponent words or distractors.\n\nSo my answer could be:\n\nCLUE: SKY\nTARGETS: moon, eagle, ray, boom, australia, germany\n\nLet me check if \"sky\" has potential connections to opponent or distractor words:\n- Could connect to \"duck\" (flies in sky)\n- Might connect to \"kiwi\" (bird, though flightless)\n\nLet me try once more with a different approach:\n\n\"Flag\" could connect:\n- australia (Australian flag)\n- germany (German flag)\n- eagle (on flags like US)\n- moon (flags planted on moon)\n- ray (sun rays on some flags)\n- strike (strike a flag)\n\nThis seems like a good option with minimal connections to opponent words or distractors.\n\nCLUE: FLAG\nTARGETS: australia, germany, eagle, moon, ray, strike\n\nLet me check if there are other good options:\n\n\"International\" could connect:\n- australia (international country)\n- germany (international country)\n- match (international match)\n- moon (international space programs)\n- eagle (international symbol)\n\nBut this might connect to \"czech\" (international country).\n\n\"Star\" could connect:\n- moon (celestial object with stars)\n- ray (star rays)\n- australia (stars on flag)\n- eagle (star performer)\n- germany (European star)\n- boom (star explosion)\n\nThis seems to have good connections to our team words with minimal connections to opponent words or distractors.\n\nCLUE: STAR\nTARGETS: moon, ray, australia, eagle, germany, boom\n\nI think \"star\" is my best option.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "CLUE: STAR\nTARGETS: moon, ray, australia, germany, eagle, boom", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 380, "output_tokens": 1515}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 10:52:41.291238", "call_duration": "0:00:23.779978", "response": "CLUE: STAR\nTARGETS: moon, ray, australia, germany, eagle, boom", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:53:12.429607", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 6 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'star'.

Military/authority connections:\n   - strike (star strikes, though this is a bit tenuous)\n   - draft (military draft might have star rankings, but this is tenuous)\n\n6. Sports connections:\n   - match (star players in sports matches)\n   - pitch (star pitchers in baseball)\n\n7.
