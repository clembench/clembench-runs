stadium and chair, but not many others.\n2. \"Travel\" could connect europe and plane, but it's a bit generic.\n3. \"Vacation\" might connect europe, plane, and possibly stadium (as a tourist attraction).\n4. \"Olympics\" could connect stadium, europe, gold, and maybe even snowman (winter Olympics).\n5. \"Competition\" could connect stadium, gold (medals), europe (competitions between countries).\n6. \"Medal\" connects strongly to gold, and somewhat to stadium (sporting events) and europe (international competitions).\n7. \"Spectator\" could connect stadium and chair.\n8. \"Winter\" connects snowman, and possibly europe (which has cold winters in many parts).\n\nI think \"Olympics\" is a strong contender as it connects multiple words well:\n- stadium (Olympic venues)\n- europe (hosts many Olympics)\n- gold (Olympic medals)\n- snowman (winter Olympics connection)\n\nLet me check if this might accidentally suggest any opponent or distractor words:\n- lab:

winter Olympics related, but not strongly\n- copper: could be related as medal material, but not as strongly as gold\n- web: not directly related\n- hand: not directly related\n\n\"Olympics\" has some slight risk with \"boot\" (winter equipment) and \"copper\" (medals), but the connections aren't strong.\n\nLet me consider \"Championship\" as well:\n- stadium: very related (championships held there)\n- europe: related (European championships)\n- snowman: not strongly related\n- gold: very related (gold medals/trophies for champions)\n- plane: not strongly related\n- chair: not strongly related\n\nSome risks with:\n- belt: championship belts\n- line: finish line\n\nI think \"Olympics\" is the better choice as it connects more team words with relatively low risk.\n\nActually, let me

sit in chairs at events\n\nIt's a bit generic but connects many words.\n\nI think I'll go with \"Olympics\" as it has the strongest connections to multiple team words while minimizing risk of suggesting opponent or distractor words.\n\nWait, I should also consider \"Athlete\":\n- stadium: where athletes perform\n- europe: has many famous athletes\n- snowman: not directly related\n- gold:
