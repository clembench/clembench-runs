You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: berry, forest, ship, point, grass, play, ham, teacher, hole.\nYour opponent's team words are: maple, hollywood, queen, mouth, ketchup, port, calf, vacuum.\nDistractor words are: pumpkin, space, boom, organ, screen, jack, cross.\nThe kill words are: church."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01Ab49uFNx2Hygkgf5zJkjod", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJA9aAr+f9ZdHnKCRc1uF+2CnxEJC1yl0kZ8AJogiDwMHqU6OWo/zVlvN6u5PhvZ9De1sDtBVCxPYMP93IVgQDYaxIMGBvk9dbQbNy6kxTsGgyPlZDYExcl36o5eqIiMDozhLJEpaVSZqvsKKlr45RGMwbSECvzxC8BSaCdUed54qbEIxanu9/L+H9NUYRs2SpQfMaofizlyXF646XUOlKuFcGtxCHxoN9UR3t/EhGngaEUI2kU7iWKPSV4ONNSTkQKyifKAHKkIAxnpYpuF0J+w+xhePK2Gdbv4ZDCNAqxFgM=", "thinking": "I need to choose a single word clue that relates to as many of my team's words as possible without relating to the opponent's words, distractor words, or especially the kill word.\n\nMy team's words are:\n1. berry\n2. forest\n3. ship\n4. point\n5. grass\n6. play\n7. ham\n8. teacher\n9. hole\n\nLet's think about possible connections:\n\nNature/Outdoors theme:\n- berry, forest, grass, hole (animals make holes in the ground)\n\nFood theme:\n- berry, ham\n\nSports/Recreation theme:\n- play, point (scoring points in games)\n\nLet me think about some possible clue words and what team words they might connect to:\n\n1. \"Garden\" could connect to:\n   - berry (grow in gardens)\n   - grass (grows in gardens)\n   - hole (you dig holes in gardens)\n   But might also connect to opponent words like \"maple\"\n\n2. \"Green\" could connect to:\n   - berry (some berries are green)\n   - forest (forests are green)\n   - grass (grass is green)\n   But might connect to \"maple\" (green leaves)\n\n3. \"Wild\" could connect to:\n   - berry (wild berries)\n   - forest (wild forests)\n   - grass (wild grasslands)\n   - ship (wild seas)\n   But might connect to \"maple\" (wild maple trees)\n\n4. \"School\" could connect to:\n   - teacher (works at a school)\n   - play (school plays)\n   - point (pointing at blackboard)\n   But \"school\" could also connect to opponent words\n\n5. \"Field\" could connect to:\n   - grass (fields of grass)\n   - berry (berry fields)\n   - hole (holes in a field)\n   -

point (pointing to teach)\n    - play (educational plays)\n\nLet me check again for any connections I might have missed and also avoid any connections to the opponent's words:\n\nOpponent's words: maple, hollywood, queen, mouth, ketchup, port, calf, vacuum\nDistractor words: pumpkin, space, boom, organ, screen, jack, cross\nKill word: church\n\nFor \"Game\":\n- play (games involve playing)\n- point (scoring points in games)\n- hole (like in golf)\n- teacher (games in class)\n- ship (ship games)\nBut might connect to \"screen\" (video games)\n\nFor \"Ground\":\n- hole (holes in the ground)\n- grass (grows from the ground)\n- berry (grows from the ground)\n- point (point to the ground)\nBut might connect to \"pumpkin\" (grows on the ground)\n\nFor \"Education\":\n- teacher (obvious connection)\n- point (teachers point things out)\n- play (educational plays)\n- forest (learning about forests)\n- berry (learning about berry plants)\n- ship (learning about ships)\n- grass (learning about grass types)\n- hole (science lessons about holes)\n- ham (cooking classes)\nThis connects to many of my team's words, but the connections are somewhat forced for some.\n\nFor \"Lesson\":\n- teacher (gives lessons)\n- play (drama lessons)\n- point (making a point in a lesson)\n- ship (lessons about navigation)\n- forest (lessons about nature)\n- berry (lessons about plants)\n- grass (botany lessons)\n- hole (geology lessons)\n- ham (cooking lessons)\nSimilar to \"Education\" -
