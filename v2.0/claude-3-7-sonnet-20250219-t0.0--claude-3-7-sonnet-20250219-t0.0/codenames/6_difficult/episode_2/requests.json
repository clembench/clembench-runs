Let me double-check these:\n\nFor \"Shape\":\n- triangle: clearly a shape\n- figure: can refer to a shape or form\n- hawk: has a distinctive silhouette/shape (though this is more tenuous)\n- No obvious connection to opponent words, distractors, or kill word.\n\nFor \"Royal\":\n- queen: clearly royal\n- hawk: sometimes associated with royalty (royal hawk)\n- figure: can be a royal figure\n- No obvious connection to opponent words, distractors, or kill word.\n\nI think \"Shape\" is a slightly stronger connection for more words. I'll choose that.\n\nCLUE: SHAPE\nTARGETS: triangle, figure, hawk\n\nWait, let me reconsider if there are any other good clues that might connect more words safely.\n\n\"Nation\" could connect:\n- australia (nation)\n- turkey (nation)\n- queen (head of nation, in some cases)\n- post (postal service is national)\n\nLet me check for potential overlaps:\n- No obvious connection to opponent words, distractors, or kill word.\n\nThis might be better as it connects 4 words.\n\nCLUE: NATION\nTARGETS: australia, turkey, queen, post\n\nLet me think again. Is there an even better clue?\n\n\"Board\" could connect:\n- triangle (board games often have triangular pieces)\n- piano (keyboard)\n- figure (board game piece)\n- queen (chess piece)\n- post (bulletin board)\n\nLet me check for potential overlaps:\n- Might connect to \"watch\" (opponent word) as in watch board/leaderboard, but that's tenuous.\n- Otherwise no obvious connection to opponent words, distractors, or kill word.\n\nThis connects 5 words and seems reasonably safe.\n\nCLUE: BOARD\nTARGETS: triangle, piano, figure, queen, post\n\nLet me check one more time for any other good options.\n\nActually, what about \"Symbol\"?\n- triangle (mathematical symbol, symbolic shape)\n- figure (symbolic representation)\n- hawk (symbol of power/vision)\n- queen (symbol of monarchy)\n- australia (national symbols)\n- turkey (national symbol)\n- post (postal symbols)\n\nLet me check for potential overlaps:\n- No obvious connection to opponent words, distractors, or kill word.\n\nThis potentially connects 7 words, which would be excellent.\n\nCLUE: SYMBOL\nTARGETS: triangle, figure, hawk, queen, australia, turkey, post\n\nThat seems like the strongest option.
