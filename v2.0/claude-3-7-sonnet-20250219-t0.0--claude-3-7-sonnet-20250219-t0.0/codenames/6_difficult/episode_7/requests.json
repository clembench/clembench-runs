This connects 3 words.\n\n5. \"Head\" for school, center, eye\nSchool has a headmaster, center can be head center, eye is in the head. This connects 3 words.\n\n6. \"Office\" for agent, file, center\nAgents work in offices, files are kept in offices, offices can have centers. This connects 3 words.\n\n7. \"Cut\" for diamond (cutting tool), file (filing), bark (can be cut from tree)\nThis connects 3 words.\n\nLet me think if there are any other connections I missed:\n\n\"Dog\" could connect bark (sound) and eye (watchdog)\n\"Wood\" could connect bark and file (wood file)\n\"Stone\" could connect diamond, file (to file stone), school (stone building)\n\"Education\" could connect school, file (educational files), agent (educational agent)\n\n\"Professional\" might connect agent, school (professional training), file (professional documents), eye (professional observation)\n\nI think \"point\" is a good clue as it connects diamond (has points), center (is a point), eye (focal point), jack (point value in cards), and potentially file (pointed tool).\n\nSo I'd say:\n\nCLUE: POINT\nTARGETS: diamond, center, eye, jack, file\n\nActually, let me double-check these connections:\n- Diamond: Has points/corners\n- Center: Is a central point\n- Eye: Focal point, viewpoint\n- Jack: In cards, jack is a point value\n- File: Can have a pointed end as a tool\n\nI think all these connections work, though the file one might be a stretch.\n\nLet me try one more option:\n\n\"Record\" might connect:\n- File (record-keeping)\n- Agent (keeps records)\n- School (keeps student records)\n- Diamond (record sales/prices)\n- Eye (record of observations)\n\nCLUE: RECORD\nTARGETS: file, agent, school, diamond, eye\n\nThe connections for diamond might be a bit forced here.\n\nLet me do one final check for any strong connections I might have missed:\n\n\"Chief\" could connect:\n- Agent (chief agent)\n- Center (chief center)\n- Jack (jack can be a chief in some contexts)\n- School (school chief/principal)\n\n\"Professional\" could connect:\n- Agent (professional agent)\n- School (professional training)\n- File (professional documents)\n- Diamond (professional jeweler)\n- Eye (professional observation)\n\nAfter reviewing these options, I think \"POINT\" is my strongest clue, connecting diamond, center, eye, jack, and possibly file.
