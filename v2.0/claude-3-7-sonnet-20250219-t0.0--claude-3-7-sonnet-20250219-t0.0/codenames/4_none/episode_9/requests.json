Let me analyze my team's words and look for connections:\n\nMy team words: angel, queen, wind, poison, ring, ice, spider, lab, spy\n\nI'll think about possible connections between these words:\n\n1. Royal theme: \"queen\", \"ring\" (as in royal jewelry)\n2. Nature elements: \"wind\", \"ice\", \"spider\"\n3. Dangerous/harmful: \"poison\", \"spider\"\n4. Scientific/investigative: \"lab\", \"spy\"\n5. Supernatural/fantasy: \"angel\", \"queen\" (as in fantasy roles)\n\nLet me try to find a word that could connect multiple of these:\n\n\"Web\" could connect:\n- \"spider\" (spiders create webs)\n- \"wind\" (webs can blow in the wind)\n- \"angel\" (angel networks, though this is a bit abstract)\n- \"spy\" (web of spies, spy networks)\n\n\"Cold\" could connect:\n- \"ice\" (ice is cold)\n- \"wind\" (cold wind)\n- \"poison\" (cold-blooded poisoning)\n- \"spy\" (cold war spies)\n\n\"Evil\" could connect:\n- \"poison\" (used for evil)\n- \"spider\" (often seen as evil/scary)\n- \"queen\" (evil queen trope)\n\n\"White\" could connect:\n- \"angel\" (often depicted as white)\n- \"ice\" (is white/clear)\n- \"lab\" (lab coats are white)\n- \"queen\" (white queen in chess/stories)\n\n\"Power\" could connect:\n- \"queen\" (has power)\n- \"poison\" (has power to kill)\n- \"ring\" (like a ring of power)\n- \"angel\" (has divine power)\n- \"wind\" (power of nature)\n\n\"Magic\" could connect:\n- \"angel\" (supernatural)\n- \"queen\" (fairytale queens with magic)\n- \"ring\" (magical rings)\n- \"ice\" (magical ice powers)\n- \"poison\" (magical potions)\n\nI think \"magic\" connects the most words in a clear way. Let me check if it's too close to any of the opponent's words, distractors, or kill words:\n\nOpponent words: ninja, casino, stream, crown, worm, root, mount, cross\nDistractors: switch, pipe, lemon, dragon, superhero, wave, agent\nKill word: face\n\n\"Magic\" doesn't seem to directly connect to the opponent's words, though there's a slight connection to \"crown\" (magical crowns) and \"superhero\" (some have magical powers).\n\nBut I think \"fairy\" might work even better:\n- \"angel\" (similar otherworldly beings)\n- \"queen\" (fairy queen is a common trope)\n- \"wind\" (fairies often control elements like wind)\n- \"poison\" (fairy potions/poisons)\n- \"ring\" (fairy rings in nature)\n- \"ice\" (fairy ice magic)\n- \"spider\" (fairies interact with small creatures)\n\n\"Fantasy\" could also work:\n- \"angel\" (fantasy creature)\n- \"queen\" (fantasy royalty)\n- \"poison\" (fantasy element)\n- \"ring\" (fantasy object)\n- \"ice\" (fantasy element)\n- \"spider\" (fantasy creature)\n\nLet me evaluate:\n- \"Magic\" connects: angel, queen, ring, ice, poison (5 words)\n- \"Fairy\" connects: angel, queen, wind, poison, ring, ice, spider (7 words)\n- \"Fantasy\" connects: angel, queen, poison, ring, ice, spider (6 words)\n\nI think \"fairy\" connects the most words and is distinct from opponent words. Let me check if it risks making my partner guess any opponent or distractor words:\n\nOpponent words related to fairy: possibly \"crown\" (fairy crowns)\nDistractors related to fairy: possibly \"dragon\" (fairy tale creatures), \"superhero\" (supernatural powers)\n\nThere's some risk with \"fairy\", but I think it's minimal.\n\nLet me try another option: \"Snow\"\n- \"angel\" (snow angels)\n- \"ice\" (snow and ice go together)\n- \"wind\" (snow is blown by wind)\n- \"queen\" (Snow Queen fairy tale)\n- \"spider\" (possible reference to snow spider species)\n\n\"Snow\" connects 4-5 words pretty clearly.\n\nOne more: \"Secret\"\n- \"spy\" (spies keep secrets)\n- \"lab\" (secret laboratory)\n- \"poison\" (secret poisoning)\n- \"ring\" (secret ring of power/people)\n- \"queen\" (royal secrets)\n- \"angel\" (secret guardian angel)\n\n\"Secret\" connects 6 words fairly well.\n\nLet me review my best options:\n1. \"Fairy\" - 7 connections\n2. \"Secret\" - 6 connections\n3. \"Fantasy\" - 6 connections\n4. \"Magic\" - 5 connections\n5. \"Snow\" - 4-5 connections\n\nI think \"fairy\" is the strongest option with the most connections, though \"secret\" is also very good and might be less likely to lead to opponent words.\n\nLet me go with \"fairy\" as my clue, relating to: angel, queen, wind, poison, ring, ice, spider.\n\nActually, I should double-check the game rules again.

Fairy queens are common in folklore (Queen Mab, Titania).\n- spy: Very weak/no connection.\n- face: Weak connection. Fairies have faces but this isn't distinctive.\n- lab: No connection.\n- stream: Moderate connection. Fairies often live near water features including streams.\n- superhero: Weak connection. Both have powers but different domains.\n- ring: Moderate connection. Fairy rings (circles of mushrooms) are a folklore concept.\n- switch: Weak/no connection.\n- root: Moderate connection. Fairies are often associated with plants/nature.\n- pipe: Weak connection.\n- agent: No connection.\n- wave: Weak connection.
