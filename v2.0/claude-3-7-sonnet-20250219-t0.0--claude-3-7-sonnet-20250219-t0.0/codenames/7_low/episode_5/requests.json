It relates to smearing someone's reputation, political attacks, etc.\n\nLightener: Something that makes things lighter - could be in terms of weight, color, mood, etc. It could refer to bleach for hair, something that brightens a mood, etc.\n\nThese words are quite different conceptually, which makes finding a single connecting word challenging. Let me consider possible connections:\n\n- Both involve transformation (muddying someone's reputation vs. making something lighter)\n- Both could relate to media/journalism in a way (mudslinging in politics, lightening content for wider audiences)\n- Both could relate to appearance (muddying vs. brightening)\n\nSome potential clues:\n- \"Transformation\" - but this is a bit abstract\n- \"Media\" - but the connection to lightener is weak\n- \"Appearance\" - could work for both\n- \"Contrast\" - mudslinger creates darkness, lightener creates brightness\n- \"Campaign\" - political mudslinging happens in campaigns, and there are lightening campaigns for hair etc.\n\nI think my best options are:\n1. Give a clue for both with a more abstract connection\n2.
