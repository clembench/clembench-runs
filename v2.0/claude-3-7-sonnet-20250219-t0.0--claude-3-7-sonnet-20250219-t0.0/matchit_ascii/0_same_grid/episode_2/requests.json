In my grid, row 2 has X at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. So there might be a difference in position (2,1) - my grid has an X there, but they didn't mention it in their description of X's around the frame.\n\nI should ask about row 2 to confirm this potential difference.\n\nActually, I already asked about row 2 in my first question, and they answered with \"1, 2, 4, 5\" which matches my grid. So row 2 is identical in both grids.\n\nLet me check the frame description:\n- First column (positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)): My grid has X in all these positions\n- Last column (positions (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)): My grid has X in all these positions\n- First row (positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)): My grid has X only at (1,1) and (1,5)\n- Last row (positions (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)): My grid has X only at (5,1) and (5,5)\n\nSo when they say \"X's forming a frame around the outside edges,\" they might mean only the corners or the entire perimeter. Let me check if there are any differences in columns 2, 3, and 4 that we haven't explicitly confirmed yet.\n\nFor column 2:\n- My grid has X at position (2,2) only\n- Their grid has X at position (2,2) (mentioned in their description)\n\nFor column 3:\n- My grid has X at position (3,3) only\n- Their grid has X at position (3,3) (mentioned in their description)\n\nFor column 4:\n- My grid has X at position (2,4) only\n- Their grid has X at position (2,4) (mentioned in their description)\n\nSo far, it seems our grids might be identical, but I should check about the outer frame to make sure we have the same understanding.
