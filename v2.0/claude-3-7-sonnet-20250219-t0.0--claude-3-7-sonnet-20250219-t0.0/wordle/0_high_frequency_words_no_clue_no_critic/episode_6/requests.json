These don't make sense.\n\nLet's try some actual English words that fit the pattern:\n- \"RETCH\" - No, doesn't end with E and has H\n- \"RETIRE\" - No, too many letters\n- \"RETIE\" - No, wouldn't have T in wrong position if it's in position 2\n- \"PETER\" - No, doesn't end with E\n\nLet me think more systematically. The word is 5 letters ending with E, so the pattern is ____E.\n\nSince I now know there's a second E in the word (from the yellow feedback), and I know it's not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nIf we put T in position 2 (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 4), we'd have _T__E.\n\nNow for R, it can't be in position 2 or 4, so it's either position 1 or 3: RT__E or _TR_E.\n\nIf we go with RT__E and put the second E in position 3 or 4, we'd have RTE_E or RT_EE.\n- RTE_E - I can't think of a valid word like this.\n- RT_EE - I can't think of a valid word like this.\n\nIf we go with _TR_E and put the second E in position 1 or 4, we'd have ETR_E or _TREE.\n- ETR_E - I can't think of a valid word like this.\n- _TREE - \"FTREE\", \"BTREE\", etc. don't sound like valid English words.\n\nI realize I was mistakenly trying to put T in position 2, but the feedback shows T has been yellow, not green, in all guesses. So T can be in position 2, but doesn't have to be.\n\nLet's reconsider. We know the word ends with E: ____E.\nWe have R, T, and another E somewhere in the word.\n\nCommon 5-letter words ending with E that might include R, T, and another E:\n- \"THREE\" - This fits! It has \"T\" in position 1, \"H\" (untested) in position 2, \"R\" in position 3, \"E\" in position 4, and \"E\" in position 5. It contains all our confirmed letters.\n\nLet me check if this works with our feedback:\n- \"THREE\" would have \"T\" in position 1, which we haven't tried yet.\n- \"THREE\" would have \"R\" in position 3, which we haven't tried yet.\n- \"THREE\" would have \"E\" in position 4, which we haven't tried yet.\n- \"THREE\" would end with \"E\", which is confirmed correct.\n- \"THREE\" introduces \"H\", which we haven't tested yet.\n\nThis seems like a good guess.
