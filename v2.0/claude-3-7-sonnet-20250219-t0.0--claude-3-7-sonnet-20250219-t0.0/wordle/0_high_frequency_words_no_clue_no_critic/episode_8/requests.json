The letter 'e' is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n2. The letters 's', 'l', 'a', and 't' are not in the word.\n\nI need to choose a word that:\n- Has 'e' in a position other than the 5th\n- Doesn't contain 's', 'l', 'a', or 't'\n- Contains other common letters that I haven't tried yet\n\nLet me try a word with 'e' in a different position and with other common letters like 'r', 'o', 'i', 'n', 'h', etc.\n\nHow about \"poine\"? No, that's not a valid English word.\n\nLet me try \"rhone\"? Not sure if that's a common enough word.\n\nLet me try \"chore\"?\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'h' is a common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'e' is positioned in the 5th spot, which I know is wrong. Let me reconsider.\n\nHow about \"truce\"? No, it contains 't' which I know is not in the word.\n\n\"price\"? No, it contains 'i' in the 3rd position, which would move 'e' to the 5th position again.\n\nLet me try \"bench\"?\n- 'b' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'e' is in the 2nd position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'h' is a common letter\n\nThis seems like a good next guess. But wait, let me make sure it doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters ('s', 'l', 'a', 't'). It doesn't, so \"bench\" is a valid guess.\n\nActually, I now realize that I've eliminated 4 of the most common letters in English: 's', 'a', 't', and 'l'. This means the word might be a bit less common. I should try to include more common letters that I haven't eliminated yet.\n\nLet me go with \"bripe\"? No, that's not a valid English word.\n\n\"price\"? No, it contains 'c' in the 3rd position and 'e' in the 5th position, which I know is wrong.\n\nI think \"bench\" is still a good guess. It has 'e' in a different position (2nd) and includes several common letters that I haven't eliminated yet.\n\nActually, I realize I've been focusing too much on 'e'. Let me try a word that includes more common letters that I haven't tested yet: 'o', 'i', 'n', 'h', 'r', 'p', etc.\n\nLet me try \"crone\"?\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 5th position, which I know is wrong. Let me reconsider.\n\n\"broil\"? No, it contains 'l' which is eliminated.\n\n\"hiker\"? No, it doesn't include 'e'.\n\n\"hinge\"? No, it has 'e' in the 5th position.\n\nLet me try \"prone\"? No, it has 'e' in the 5th position.\n\nI think I'll go with \"choir\". Wait, I need to check that it contains 'e'. It doesn't, so not a good choice.\n\nLet me go with \"porch\".\n- 'p' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'h' is a common letter\n\nThis doesn't contain 'e', though, which I know is in the word. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, let's go with \"borne\".\n- 'b' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 5th position, which I know is wrong.\n\nOh wait, 'e' in the 5th position is wrong, according to the feedback. I need to ensure 'e' is in a different position.\n\n\"hinge\" has 'e' in the 5th position, so it's not a good choice.\n\nLet me try \"reign\"?\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 2nd position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'i' is a common vowel\n- 'g' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'n' is a common letter\n\nThis looks good! Let's go with \"reign\" as my next guess.\n\nActually, I realize there's a slight issue: \"reign\" has 'e' in the 2nd position, but I'm not sure if that's the correct position for 'e'. It's possible 'e' could be in positions 1, 3, or 4 as well. But I still think \"reign\" is a reasonable guess given the information I have.\n\nHmm, actually I think I made a careless statement earlier. I said 'e' is in position 5 in \"borne\", but it actually is. Let me try \"borne\".\n\nActually, let me go with \"crime\".\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'i' is a common vowel\n- 'm' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 5th position, which ... oh, I keep making this mistake. 'e' can't be in the 5th position.\n\nLet's try \"creep\".\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 2nd and 3rd positions, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'e' is in the 3rd position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'p' is a somewhat common letter\n\nThis looks good! Let's go with \"creep\" as my next guess.\n\nWait, I need to consider that I already know 'e' is not in the 5th position. So I should try to maximize the information I get by using different letters where possible.\n\nLet me try \"irony\".\n- 'i' is a common vowel\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'y' is a somewhat common letter\n\nThis doesn't contain 'e', though. I need to ensure I include 'e' in my guess.\n\nLet me go with \"brode\".\n- 'b' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'd' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 5th position, which I know is wrong.\n\nI keep making the same mistake. I need a word with 'e' in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n\"fiend\"?\n- 'f' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'i' is a common vowel\n- 'e' is in the 3rd position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'd' is a common letter\n\nThis looks good! Let's go with \"fiend\" as my next guess.\n\nWait, I'm not sure if \"brode\" is a valid English word. Let me reconsider.\n\n\"ocher\"?\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'h' is a common letter\n- 'e' is in the 4th position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'r' is a common letter\n\nThis looks good! Let's go with \"ocher\" as my next guess.\n\nWait, I think I should try to maximize the usage of common letters. Given that 's', 'l', 'a', and 't' are not in the word, I should focus on other common letters.\n\nLet me try \"irony\".\n- 'i' is a common vowel\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'o' is a common vowel\n- 'n' is a common letter\n- 'y' is a somewhat common letter\n\nThis doesn't include 'e', though, which I know is in the word.\n\nLet me try \"perch\".\n- 'p' is a somewhat common letter\n- 'e' is in the 2nd position, which is different from my previous guess\n- 'r' is a common letter\n- 'c' is a common letter\n- 'h' is a common letter\n\nThis looks good!
