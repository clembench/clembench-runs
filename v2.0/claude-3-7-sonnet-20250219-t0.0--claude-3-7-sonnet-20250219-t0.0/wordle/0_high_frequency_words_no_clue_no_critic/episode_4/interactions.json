You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:17:55.374922", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a strategic word that contains common vowels (A, I, E) and frequently used consonants (R, S).\nguess: raise"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:17:55.375472", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = forum\nguess = raise\nguess_feedback = r<yellow> a<red> i<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:17:55.375628", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<yellow> a<red> i<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:18:02.665205", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since 'r' is yellow, it's in the word but not in the first position.
