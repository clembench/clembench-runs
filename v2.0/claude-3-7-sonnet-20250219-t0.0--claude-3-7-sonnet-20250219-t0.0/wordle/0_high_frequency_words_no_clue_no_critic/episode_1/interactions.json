You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:14:14.076603", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a word that contains common vowels and consonants to gather information about the target word.\nguess: raise"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:14:14.077144", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = audio\nguess = raise\nguess_feedback = r<red> a<yellow> i<yellow> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:14:14.077303", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<red> a<yellow> i<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:14:20.294369", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, 'a' and 'i' are in the word but in wrong positions, while 'r', 's', and 'e' are not in the word.
