Include 'a' but in a different position (not 3rd)\n2. Use different letters than 's', 't', 'r', 'e'\n3.

But that's still a different position from \"stare\" where 'a' was in the 3rd position.\n\nWait, I'm still confused about the positions. In \"stare\", 'a' is actually in the 3rd position (s=1, t=2, a=3, r=4, e=5). So the feedback is telling me that 'a' is in the word but not in the 3rd position.\n\nLet me try \"claim\" as my next guess:\n- Puts 'a' in the 3rd position (different from the 3rd position in \"stare\")\n- Uses completely new consonants (c, l, i, m)\n- Introduces a new vowel 'i'\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem right. In \"claim\", 'a' would be in the 3rd position, which is the same position it was in for \"stare\".\n\nLet me check the position of 'a' in \"stare\" again:\ns = position 1\nt = position 2\na = position 3\nr = position 4\ne = position 5\n\nSo 'a' is in position 3 in \"stare\", and the feedback says 'a' is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nSo for my next guess, I need a word that:\n1.
