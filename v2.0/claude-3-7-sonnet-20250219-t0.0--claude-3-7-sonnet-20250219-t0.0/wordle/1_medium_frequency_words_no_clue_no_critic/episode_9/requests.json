But wait, 'k' can't be in position 5.\n\nMaybe \"chalk\"?

Let me try an uncommon word that fits all the constraints just to test the letter positions.\n\n\"chalb\" - 'c' (untested), 'h' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'l' in position 4, 'b' (untested). This fits our constraints for 'l' and 'a' but doesn't have 'k'.\n\nActually, I don't think \"chalb\" is a valid English word.\n\nI'll go with \"brawl\" for now to at least test 'l' in position 5 and introduce a couple of new letters. Then I can refine further based on the feedback.\n\nActually, let me double-check if there are common 5-letter words with:\n- 'a' as the 3rd letter\n- 'l' in position 1, 4, or 5\n- 'k' in position 1, 2, or 4\n\n\"plaid\" - 'p' (untested), 'l' in position 2 (which we know is wrong), 'a' in position 3, 'i' (untested), 'd' (untested). This doesn't work because 'l' is in position 2.\n\n\"clark\" - 'c' (untested), 'l' in position 2 (which we know is wrong), 'a' in position 3, 'r' (untested), 'k' in position 5 (which we know is wrong). This doesn't work because 'l' is in position 2 and 'k' is in position 5.\n\nActually, what about \"qualm\"? 'q' (untested), 'u' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'l' in position 4, 'm' (untested). This fits our constraints for 'l' and 'a' but doesn't have 'k'.\n\nI think I'll go with \"whalp\" - 'w' (untested), 'h' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'l' in position 4, 'p' (untested). This fits our constraints for 'l' and 'a' but doesn't have 'k'.\n\nActually, I don't know if \"whalp\" is a valid English word.\n\nLet me try \"whack\" - 'w' (untested), 'h' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'c' (untested), 'k' in position 5.

But I don't think \"mkarl\" is a valid English word.\n\nOk, I think I need to prioritize one letter over the other and find a valid word.\n\nLet me try \"chalk\" - 'c' (untested), 'h' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'l' in position 4, 'k' in position 5.

Let me try \"plaza\" - 'p' (untested), 'l' in position 2 (which we know is wrong), 'a' in position 3, 'z' (untested), 'a' (untested). This doesn't work because 'l' is in position 2.\n\nLet me go with \"dialy\" - 'd' (untested), 'i' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'l' in position 4, 'y' (untested). This fits our constraints for 'l' and 'a' but doesn't have 'k'.\n\nActually, I think \"dialy\" should be \"daily\", and I just realized that we have 'k' in the word too that needs to be accommodated. I'm really struggling to find a common word with all these constraints.\n\nLet me try \"shaky\" - 's' is not in the word, so this won't work.\n\nWhat about \"peaky\"? 'p' (untested), 'e' is not in the word, so this won't work.\n\n\"joaks\" is not a valid English word.\n\nI think I need to be more flexible in my approach.

This doesn't work.\n\n\"quail\" - 'q' (untested), 'u' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'i' (untested), 'l' in position 5. This fits our constraints for 'l' and 'a' but doesn't have 'k'.\n\nI'll go with \"quail\" for now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider once more. The word has 'a' in position 3, 'l' somewhere (not position 2), and 'k' somewhere (not position 5).\n\nWhat about \"clakb\"? This isn't a valid English word.\n\n\"champ\" - 'c' (untested), 'h' (untested), 'a' in position 3, 'm' (untested), 'p' (untested).
