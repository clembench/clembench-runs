You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:24:34.551968", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: For my first guess, I'll use a word with common letters in English to gather information efficiently. \"CRANE\" contains popular vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N) without any repeated letters.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:24:34.552413", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = linen\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:24:34.552577", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:24:46.391422", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, I know that N and E are in the word but in wrong positions, while C, R, and A are not in the word at all.
