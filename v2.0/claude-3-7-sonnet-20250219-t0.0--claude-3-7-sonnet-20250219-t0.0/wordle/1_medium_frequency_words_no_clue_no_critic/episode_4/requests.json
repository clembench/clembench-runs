This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01AF1wv5m2pq1EtWVBXup5MN", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAfdQ2cAOdT/8lKSoxi9VAfcoPE+jAl2jM1BJ8FANZenUYfL/O0GNcJxpTmEvImJb0jpjU6+D99yoqdUPFL9DLghIMCrp+2VqQuLdd5Y0YGgw4tHd+1Bei+60myIsiMMSoWOvsSZIB6lXRCM9JWXJDUpx8knxokj2t+ZuVE81InlzDOixxFI33GflU3+KBFypQ2s8MNNPjSyKKesexwMo16t3gH0Ibp1nhX+z7y/kL6yVfTKSwSo3aJuCHK3tfbc3AdDn0dYDsQg2//P1FFITHcmrFWMKMDgITm2EXq26MKf4=", "thinking": "I'm being asked to play a Wordle-like game.
