This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01TVvwFwTJ4LmNR34HDYQx1M", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAJtul+Rrc2tYSzKnG069Y9VsK+oJgp6AxyfICWlyFcVqDVvnYURSNXARCazGt3JRl5OMxu1x7zam8bwmuLCOw5RIM522eR+7p+8uf/BYAGgzoqR2QvSvgUtuSDtEiMDhpbB0U7ubPgjn1s3gxyCQqX+CDuMbYOX1AGfk4HvSLACUK/NA1kt8lk9Lb4unE/ipQpkBUkzXJSUZmjIVoIuJ8aecN/RS2aGy0jShp8PV5FOjt9j1J1KeVr+l1onQxDh3NiDfpZlJXvMO7Bqs86TVlSCr8xPw+9SBB9xnojiLUYSI=", "thinking": "I need to make my first guess for Wordle.
