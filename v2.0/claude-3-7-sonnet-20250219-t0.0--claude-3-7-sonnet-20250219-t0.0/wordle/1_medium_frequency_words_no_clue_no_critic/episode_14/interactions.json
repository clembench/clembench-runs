You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:33:39.604412", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common Wordle opening word that contains frequently used letters, including vowels 'a' and 'e' and common consonants 'c', 'r', and 'n'.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:33:39.604803", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:33:39.604959", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:33:56.109454", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, 'r' and 'a' are in the word but in wrong positions, while 'c', 'n', and 'e' are not in the word.
