Has 'a' as the second letter\n2. Contains 'r' and 'l' in positions other than where we've tried them\n3. Doesn't contain any letters we know are not in the word\n\nPossible words:\n- WALTZ (w-a-l-t-z)\n- FAITH (f-a-i-t-h) - No, has 'h' which we know isn't in the word\n- DALLY (d-a-l-l-y)\n- FLASK (f-l-a-s-k) - No, has 's' which we know isn't in the word\n- PLAID (p-l-a-i-d)\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let's double-check where we've tried 'l' and 'r':\n- 'l' was in position 1 (in \"labor\")\n- 'r' was in positions 3 (in \"crane\") and 5 (in \"labor\")\n\nSo 'l' could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. And 'r' could be in positions 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet's try \"parli\" or something similar where 'a' is in position 2, 'r' is in position 3 (not tried there yet), and 'l' is in position 4.\n\nActually, \"parli\" is not a standard English word. Let's try something else.\n\nWhat about \"talir\"? No, that's not a common English word either.\n\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word where:\n- Second letter is 'a'\n- Contains 'l' and 'r' in positions where we haven't tried them yet\n- Doesn't contain 'c', 'n', 'e', 'm', 's', 'h', 'b', 'o'\n\nWhat about \"WARLY\"? I don't think that's a standard English word.\n\nLet me try \"DAILY\". But that has an 'i' in the fourth position and 'l' in the third position. We haven't confirmed that 'i' is in the word.\n\nLet's try \"FAULT\". But that has 'u' which we haven't confirmed, and 't' which we haven't confirmed.\n\nI think \"WALTZ\" might be a good guess. It has 'a' in the second position (which we know is correct), 'l' in a new position (position 3), and introduces some new letters ('w', 't', 'z') to gather more information. It doesn't contain 'r' though, which we know is in the word.\n\nLet me try \"WARTS\". But that has 's' which we know isn't in the word.\n\nLet me try \"WARTY\". That has 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'r' in position 3 (not tried there yet), 't' and 'y' are new letters to test, but it doesn't contain 'l' which we know is in the word.\n\nActually, since we have 'a' confirmed in position 2, and 'l' and 'r' are in the word somewhere, let's try \"PARL_\" words. \"PARLY\" isn't a common word but \"PARLI\" looks uncommon as well.\n\nLet me think of another approach. What about \"VALID\"? That has 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'l' in position 3 (not tried there yet), 'i' and 'd' are new letters to test, but it doesn't contain 'r' which we know is in the word.\n\nWhat about \"FLAIR\"? That has 'a' in position 3 (not position 2 which we know is correct), 'l' in position 2, 'i' is a new letter to test, and 'r' in position 5 (which we tried in \"labor\" and it wasn't correct).\n\nOk, what about \"GAWKY\"? But that doesn't have 'l' or 'r'.\n\nI'm struggling to find a perfect word that meets all our criteria. Let me try \"TARDY\". That has 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'r' in position 3 (not tried there yet), 'd' and 'y' are new letters to test, but it doesn't contain 'l' which we know is in the word.\n\nActually, let's go with \"KALIR\". It has 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'l' in position 3 (not tried there yet), 'i' is a new letter to test, and 'r' in position 5 (which we tried in \"labor\" and it wasn't correct). But I'm not sure if \"KALIR\" is a common English word.\n\nOK, so I'm actually struggling more than I expected. Let me take a step back and think...\n\nWe have:\n- 'a' is definitely the second letter\n- 'l' and 'r' are in the word, but not in the positions we've tried (1st position for 'l', 3rd and 5th for 'r')\n- Letters not in the word: 'c', 'n', 'e', 'm', 's', 'h', 'b', 'o'\n\nLet's try \"DAILY\". It has 'a' in the correct position, 'l' in a new position (3rd), and introduces new letters 'd', 'i', and 'y'. However, it doesn't contain 'r' which we know is in the word.\n\nActually, I think I'm going to try \"RALPH\". It has 'a' in the second position (correct), 'l' in position 3 (not tried there yet), 'r' in position 1 (not tried there yet), and 'p' and 'h' are new letters to test. Wait, 'h' is not in the word based on our earlier feedback.\n\nLet me try \"RALTY\". It has 'r' in position 1 (not tried there yet), 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'l' in position 3 (not tried there yet), and 't' and 'y' are new letters to test.\n\nWait, \"RALTY\" doesn't seem to be a common English word.\n\nLet me try \"RALLY\". It has 'r' in position 1 (not tried there yet), 'a' in position 2 (correct), 'l' in positions 3 and 4 (not tried there yet), and 'y' is a new letter to test.\n\nActually, let's go with \"RALLY\".
