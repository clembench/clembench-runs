Let's recap what we know:\nFrom first guess (arise): \"i\" is green in position 3, \"s\" is yellow in position 4, \"a\", \"r\", \"e\" are not in the word.\nFrom second guess (using): \"i\" is still green in position 3, \"s\" is yellow in position 2, \"n\" is yellow in position 4, \"u\", \"g\" are not in the word.\nFrom third guess (hints): \"h\", \"t\" are not in the word, \"i\" is now yellow in position 2, \"n\" is yellow in position 3, \"s\" is yellow in position 5.\n\nSo the letters we know are in the word: \"i\", \"s\", \"n\"\nLetters not in the word: \"a\", \"r\", \"e\", \"u\", \"g\", \"h\", \"t\"\n\nThe weird thing is that \"i\" was green in position 3 for the first two guesses, but yellow in the third guess. This is inconsistent with the rules of Wordle unless the target word changed. Let me assume there's some issue and just focus on the latest feedback.\n\nBased on the third guess feedback:\n- \"i\" is in the word but not in position 2\n- \"n\" is in the word but not in position 3\n- \"s\" is in the word but not in position 5\n\nFrom previous feedback:\n- \"i\" was in position 3 (from first two guesses)\n- \"s\" is not in positions 2, 4, or 5\n- \"n\" is not in positions 2 or 4\n\nGiven these constraints, and assuming \"i\" should be in position 3 (from the first two guesses), \"s\" must be in position 1, and \"n\" must be in position 5.\n\nSo we have:\nPosition 1: \"s\"\nPosition 2: Not \"i\", \"n\", \"s\" (and not \"a\", \"r\", \"e\", \"u\", \"g\", \"h\", \"t\")\nPosition 3: \"i\" (assuming the first two feedbacks are correct)\nPosition 4: Not \"n\", \"s\" (and not \"a\", \"r\", \"e\", \"u\", \"g\", \"h\", \"t\")\nPosition 5: \"n\"\n\nIf \"i\" should NOT be in position 3 (based on the third feedback), then we have more uncertainty.\n\nLet's try \"swins\" (not sure if this is a valid word, but it places \"s\" in positions 1 and 5, \"w\" is a new letter, \"i\" in position 3, and \"n\" in position 4).\n\nActually, \"swins\" isn't a common word. Let me try \"skiln\" (assuming it's valid):\n- \"s\" in position 1: possible\n- \"k\" is a new letter: fine\n- \"i\" in position 3: was green before but yellow in last feedback\n- \"l\" is a new letter: fine\n- \"n\" in position 5: possible\n\nWait, I'm still confused about the \"i\" position. Let me be super clear about this:\n- First guess (arise): \"i\" is green in position 3\n- Second guess (using): \"i\" is green in position 3\n- Third guess (hints): \"i\" is yellow in position 2\n\nSince \"i\" was never tried in position 2 before, we don't know if it being yellow there is new information. But the fact that it was green in position 3 in the first two guesses means it should be there.\n\nLet me just assume \"i\" is in position 3, \"s\" is in position 1, and \"n\" is in position 5.\n\nLooking at valid 5-letter words that match this pattern:\n- s _ i _ n\n\nOptions could include:\n- swizn (probably not a word)\n- skin (but this is 4 letters)\n- slain (but we know \"a\" is not in the word)\n- spill (but we know \"l\" is not in the word)\n\nLet me think of valid 5-letter words matching s _ i _ n:\n- scion\n- sling (but \"l\" might not be in the word)\n- spion (not sure if this is a valid word)\n\nLet's try \"scion\":\n- \"s\" in position 1: possible\n- \"c\" is a new letter: fine\n- \"i\" in position 3: was green before\n- \"o\" is a new letter: fine\n- \"n\" in position 5: possible\n\nThis seems like a valid guess!", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: This feedback is confusing because \"i\" was green in position 3 for the first two guesses but now yellow in position 2.

That means \"n\" must be in the final position (position 5).\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. Let me trace through the feedback again:\n\nGuess 1: \"arise\" → a(red) r(red) i(green) s(yellow) e(red)\nGuess 2: \"using\" → u(red) s(yellow) i(green) n(yellow) g(red)\nGuess 3: \"hints\" → h(red) i(yellow) n(yellow) t(red) s(yellow)\nGuess 4: \"scion\" → s(green) c(red) i(green) o(red) n(yellow)\n\nFor the third guess, \"i\" was yellow, not green, which is strange since it was green in the previous guesses. Let me carefully reconsider this.\n\nIn guess 3, \"i\" is in position 2, not position 3 as in the other guesses. So this confirms \"i\" is in position 3.\n\nFor guess 3, both \"n\" and \"s\" were yellow. Now in guess 4, \"s\" is green in position 1, and \"n\" is still yellow (in position 5). So we know:\n- \"s\" is in position 1\n- \"i\" is in position 3\n- \"n\" is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5\n\nWait, this suggests \"n\" must be in position 1, but we already know \"s\" is in position 1. There's a contradiction. Let me go back and carefully check the feedback.\n\nActually, for guess 2 \"using\", \"n\" was in position 4 and showed yellow. For guess 3 \"hints\", \"n\" was in position 3 and showed yellow. For guess 4 \"scion\", \"n\" was in position 5 and showed yellow.\n\nSo \"n\" cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Since we've determined many letters that are not in the word (a, r, e, u, g, h, t, c, o), we need to consider other possibilities.\n\nCommon letters we haven't tried: b, d, f, j, k, l, m, p, q, v, w, x, y, z\n\nLet me think about common five-letter words with the pattern \"sni__\".\n\n\"sniff\" could be a possibility, but the double \"f\" might be unlikely.\n\"snipe\" has \"e\" which we know is not in the word.\n\"snick\" is a possibility.\n\"sniff\" is another possibility.\n\"slink\" doesn't fit our pattern since we know \"s\" is in position 1 and \"n\" in position 2.\n\nHmm, I'm having trouble thinking of common words with \"sni\" at the start.
