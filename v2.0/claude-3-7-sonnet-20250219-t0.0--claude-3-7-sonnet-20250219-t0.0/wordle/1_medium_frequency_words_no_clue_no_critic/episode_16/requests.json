This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_015JfsRr6cAH8UHSjKgzy3d8", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAlzX+sYi9JdDX4H/9P6+oXcIeB5m7NRn4Fm+eJ2E0TnZSzB1HhtZ9s2R83LK9M3+DqHeOx69NGWRE1R6aFSOCghIMxj1qBKzqyb9tVW6MGgyGtcJsxuvFOaeDwPIiMMByh5wh4RnEbKgr2mvNbZWRq2RqienmZVUd7W0hq+1h+cg6+Jl2MU6VNSnyZbDfRSpQTHmvH5l+KV4n67GZaD/4faJTdFYohze0DkQ/3bWkwjXyS9CZo2paA3hE5e9SEUfcfk0Bc7r1Fjq6Il4tbT+i+NDnz3nwDCYESkMoeLFssq8=", "thinking": "I need to make my first guess for Wordle.
