	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For instance, if your guess is "apple", your response should be\\ \tt explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.

	 explanation: The feedback shows 'o' is definitely in position 2, and 'a' is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4. From previous feedback, we know 'a' is not in position 3 or 5 either, which means it must be in position 1. Letters confirmed not in the word: c, r, n, e, l, d, s, k. So the word starts with "ao___". I'll try a common word with this pattern that doesn't contain any ruled-out letters.\\ \tt guess: about

	 explanation: This feedback is revealing but confusing! Previously, 'o' was green in position 2, but now it's yellow - meaning it's in the word but not in position 2. The same for 'a' - it's in the word but not in position 1. Also, 't' is in the word but not in position 5. Letters we know are NOT in the word: c, r, n, e, l, d, s, k, b, u. Letters that ARE in the word: a, o, t. Let me try a word with these letters in different positions.\\ \tt guess: topaz
