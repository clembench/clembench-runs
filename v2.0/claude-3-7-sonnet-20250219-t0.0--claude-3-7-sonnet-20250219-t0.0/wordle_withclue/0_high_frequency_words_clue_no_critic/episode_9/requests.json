This suggests that the target word is the first word in a song title by Sammy Kaye, where the full title is \"[word] tomorrow\".\n\nLet me think about possible Sammy Kaye hits with \"tomorrow\" in the title. Sammy Kaye was a big band leader and recording artist from the mid-20th century. \n\nOne of his well-known hits was \"I'll See You In My Dreams\" but that doesn't match our pattern.\n\nWait, I believe there was a popular song called \"I'll Be Seeing You\" but that's not it either.\n\nLet me think about songs with \"tomorrow\" in the title:\n- \"Tomorrow Never Comes\"\n- \"There's Always Tomorrow\"\n- \"Tomorrow Is Another Day\"\n\nI recall that Sammy Kaye had a hit called \"I'll Buy That Dream\" but that doesn't fit our pattern either.\n\nWait, I think Sammy Kaye had a hit called \"Until Tomorrow\" which would fit perfectly with our clue \"___ tomorrow\". The word \"until\" has 5 letters, which matches the Wordle requirements.\n\nSo my first guess will be \"until\".\n\nLet's double-check:\n- It's 5 letters: u-n-t-i-l\n- It fits the clue \"___ tomorrow\" as \"Until Tomorrow\" (a Sammy Kaye hit)\n- It's a valid English word\n\nYes, this seems like a reasonable first guess based on the available information.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: The clue \"___ tomorrow\" (Sammy Kaye hit) suggests a 5-letter word that precedes \"tomorrow\" in a Sammy Kaye song title.
