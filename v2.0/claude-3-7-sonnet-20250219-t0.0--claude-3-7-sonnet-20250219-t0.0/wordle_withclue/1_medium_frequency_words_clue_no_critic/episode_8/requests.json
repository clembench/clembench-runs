Let me think of 5-letter words that might fit this clue:\n\n1. SNEER - A facial expression showing contempt or disdain\n2. SCOFF - To speak in a derisively mocking way\n3. SMIRK - A smug or conceited smile\n4. SNORT - A sound of derision or contempt\n5. SCORN - To feel or express contempt or disdain\n6. LAUGH - Could be a mocking laugh\n7. JEER - To mock or taunt\n8. TAUNT - To provoke or challenge with insulting remarks\n\nFrom these options, I think the best fit for a \"haughty response\" would be \"SNEER\" or \"SCOFF\". Let me pick one for my first guess.\n\n\"SNEER\" seems like a good representation of a haughty response - it's that condescending facial expression that shows contempt or superiority.
