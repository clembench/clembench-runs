I need to describe the target word \"independent\" for another player to guess.\n2. I cannot use the word \"independent\" itself, nor morphological variants of it.\n3. I also cannot use the related words: \"autarkical\", \"strong-minded\", and \"separate\".\n4. The other player gets 3 guesses to identify the word.\n5. I should give short, to-the-point descriptions due to time pressure.\n\nLet me think about how to describe \"independent\" without using the prohibited words:\n\n\"Independent\" means:\n- Not dependent on others\n- Self-sufficient\n- Autonomous\n- Free from outside control\n- Not relying on others\n- Standing alone\n- Self-governing\n- Not affiliated with larger entities\n- Making own decisions\n\nI need to avoid:\n- \"independent\" and variants like \"independence\", \"independently\", etc.\n- \"autarkical\" (self-sufficient)\n- \"strong-minded\" (making own decisions firmly)\n- \"separate\" (apart from others)\n\nHere's a concise clue I could use:\n\n\"A person who doesn't need help from others and makes their own choices. Many countries celebrate becoming this on their national day.\"\n\nThis describes independence without using the prohibited words. It uses the concept of self-sufficiency and autonomy without directly using those terms. The reference to countries gaining independence is a clear hint.\n\nLet me check once more to ensure I'm not using any prohibited words:\n- No use of \"independent\" or variants ✓\n- No use of \"autarkical\" ✓\n- No use of \"strong-minded\" ✓\n- No use of \"separate\" ✓\n\nThis clue should be effective while following all the rules.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "CLUE: A person who can take care of themselves and make their own decisions without relying on others.
