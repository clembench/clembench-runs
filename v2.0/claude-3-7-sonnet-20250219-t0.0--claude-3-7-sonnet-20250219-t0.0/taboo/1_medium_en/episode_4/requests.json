The most obvious word that comes to mind is \"rough\" itself, which directly means the opposite of smooth and describes the texture of sandpaper or unpolished wood.\n\nLet me think if there could be other possible answers:\n- Coarse: Similar to rough, describes something that has a harsh, unrefined texture\n- Grainy: Describes something that has small particles, like sand\n- Jagged: Describes something with sharp projections\n- Rugged: Often used to describe rough terrain\n- Abrasive: Something that can wear down other surfaces by rubbing\n- Textured: Having a surface that is not smooth\n\nAmong these options, \"rough\" seems the most direct answer to the clue given.
