You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL L L L L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nWhat is your next command?\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the first column with L"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the fifth column with L"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the third row with L"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01LQAuX7Y8wteaWjXh3wm8bp", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAJIpqP+LbdWiRYDvZgkAb8i95jjdsVvSxcVQIKDsV9X/zpx4v16IafVo7keZdiw39hLDvfXp3ktfG9UzsDrXFvxIM+/zWbTFK48em1XVFGgxvdU5ObRXJ6/aABgQiMMugNXVErZpD0ffyS5bCcF+CxoAMzwjdzBxT5vDkfJAUUdmQO8setAXdeEF35IwKXipQ7nYN1CPW5ODQ7FemrvEHVPvcqdSkK2Z9RAoQwbh89id8deknE4Xm1do3glq/AXn7hKLBo5OpkbKh844hSZ2NJfhtGwEdjoMTgOzsLhaKS68=", "thinking": "Let's review what commands I've given and what cells are filled:\n\n1. \"Fill the first column with L\" - This filled all cells in the first column with L.\n2. \"Fill the fifth column with L\" - This filled all cells in the fifth column with L.\n3. \"Fill the third row with L\" - This filled all cells in the third row with L.\n\nLooking at the original filled grid:\n```\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL L L L L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\nL ▢ ▢ ▢ L\n```\n\nI've already filled:\n- The entire first column (all Ls in column 1)\n- The entire fifth column (all Ls in column 5)\n- The entire third row (all Ls in row 3)\n\nChecking what remains to be filled...
