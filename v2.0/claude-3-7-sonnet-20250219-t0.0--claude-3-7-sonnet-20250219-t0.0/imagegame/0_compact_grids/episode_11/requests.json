You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ I I I I\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nI ▢ I I I\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ I\n▢ I I I I\nWhat is your next command?\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put I in the first row columns 2, 3, 4, and 5"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put I in the first column of rows 2, 3, and 4"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put I in the bottom row columns 2, 3, 4, and 5"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put I in the last column of row 4"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put I in the third row columns 3, 4, and 5"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01NSYHbf6rt3UswG6kvqLr2k", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAFZxkM3/JAgB7joV/MOfzohgkN0kuk7tS5BG9m2ftJTzrnzOz6zpvOwzThuAoy6MgB5k3YkwxPkXwpwZ7tm90TBIMGOjS3wdKLmfjra6WGgysuRx+W4eEVmgx3woiMCMoS+gkbJKJB4zQ+VI3QTJkLRr/HVJjYFGkQw/zfNVAnk2NmAFhx5RedpCr5E0MPCpQloJ1dxBakjcfRM2Rn090GEPNrZQiCgqv/lOPpXbkQ5S/EGwmTO4EFuKwQPtlqpqXADc9xJE95NGr+tNosIrLN23n2YWWBgssD+wYOn44UAw=", "thinking": "Let me review the grid as it should look now based on the commands I've given:\n\nInitial grid:\n▢ I I I I\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nI ▢ I I I\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ I\n▢ I I I I\n\nFirst command: Put I in the first row columns 2, 3, 4, and 5\nThis placed I's in the first row from column 2 to 5.\n\nSecond command: Put I in the first column of rows 2, 3, and 4\nThis placed I's in column 1 for rows 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThird command: Put I in the bottom row columns 2, 3, 4, and 5\nThis placed I's in row 5 from column 2 to 5.\n\nFourth command: Put I in the last column of row 4\nThis placed an I in column 5 of row 4.\n\nFifth command: Put I in the third row columns 3, 4, and 5\nThis placed I's in row 3 for columns 3, 4, and 5.\n\nLet me verify against the original grid:\n▢ I I I I - first row: columns 2-5 have I's ✓\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ - second row: column 1 has I ✓\nI ▢ I I I - third row: column 1 has I, columns 3-5 have I's ✓\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ I - fourth row: column 1 has I, column 5 has I ✓\n▢ I I I I - fifth row: columns 2-5 have I's ✓\n\nI've covered all the I's in the grid.
