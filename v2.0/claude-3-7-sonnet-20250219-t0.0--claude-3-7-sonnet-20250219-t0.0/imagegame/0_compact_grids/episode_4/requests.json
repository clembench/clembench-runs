For example, after filling the first and last rows with B, when I fill the third column with B, I'll be redundantly specifying the B at positions (1,3) and (5,3).

You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nB B B B B\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\nB B B B B\nWhat is your next command?\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the first row with B"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the third column with B"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Fill the last row with B"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01Griw8AMPnxQj3WXkbPzGto", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAqSnq+hIfw56dVDNF0ZyGxgn/G8EqOBnhBpshULT4XOd0aU7oHI4GoIUIzcQ6MGQktKw+qnSAEsuT3woLCrqD2xIMLXuwvLXQjZLgISmzGgxVT+vDqMEffg8PsqoiMLXQJo0FPMuWeBQMX8D5925dTSAbBRsH1JaOi1yCiwt7naQcWFvXn5/S3zqk/7+TzSpQG02GSCpbJj5PYnteEp8ihBAHPfN8ntZsYpo3ThBzZy2hXj4S+477h2Nqt8htJBAyOEBBKrVbEn68i8QM9hKoCcCYRXSM+yxfYKJdSasjSTI=", "thinking": "Let me review the grid we're trying to create:\n\nB B B B B  (first row is filled with B)\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢  (only the third column has B)\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢  (only the third column has B)\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢  (only the third column has B)\nB B B B B  (last row is filled with B)\n\nSo far, I've given these commands:\n1.
