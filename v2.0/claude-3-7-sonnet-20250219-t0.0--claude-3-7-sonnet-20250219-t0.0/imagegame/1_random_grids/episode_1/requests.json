Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nR ▢ R R R\n▢ R ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put Rs in the first row, columns 1, 3, 4, and 5"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put an R in the second row, second column"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put an R in the fourth row, first column"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01AVARor9Nk1xWEK9pAbgFYx", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAgUDeo2ySAs5uoqFOtih8LfhocEIM5gZx4nKTvlqzgwOvVr7tnxr5Oxs9qj+V/guFZUWcd6GnR56nq6d9V82RihIMQxigRMSyEJ8BYtYtGgwyGCBBln0PYvHxyIQiMEcJl1KKO6FrsNhwcYPZMNyFCo0OR+I5wvvKBs2FSThSYWejaPTsC3EryNo8RhulmypQjFNWkI6Qx3m5XDQL/vb5K6SnSoLW3Ozvuaj116l8RP00Tn10+nqM7dUOSUfK66fmg5zpAPnpY0wglSPVRaNqKjT35Z81111cxzDUZTAHWN8=", "thinking": "Let me review what we've done so far and check if we've filled in all the Rs according to the given example:\n\nOriginal grid:\nR ▢ R R R\n▢ R ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nCommands given:\n1.
