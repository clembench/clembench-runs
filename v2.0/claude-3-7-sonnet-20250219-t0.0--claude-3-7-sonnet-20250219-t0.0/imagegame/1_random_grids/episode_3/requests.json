Let me identify where the Z's are located:\n\n1. In the second row, fifth column (row 2, col 5)\n2. In the third row, first column (row 3, col 1)\n3. In the third row, fifth column (row 3, col 5)\n4. In the fourth row, fifth column (row 4, col 5)\n5. In the fifth row, fourth column (row 5, col 4)\n6. In the fifth row, fifth column (row 5, col 5)\n\nI need to provide commands to place these Z's. I can combine some of these into a single command if they form a pattern.\n\nLooking at the grid, I notice there's a pattern with the Z's in the rightmost column (column 5). There are Z's in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 in that column. So I could give a command to fill that entire column with Z's. Additionally, there's a Z in row 3, column 1, and in row 5, column 4.\n\nHere's my plan for the commands:\n1. Command: Put Z in the fifth column of rows 2, 3, 4, and 5\n2. Command: Put Z in third row first column\n3. Command: Put Z in fifth row fourth column\n\nActually, I see that I've miscounted.

You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.
