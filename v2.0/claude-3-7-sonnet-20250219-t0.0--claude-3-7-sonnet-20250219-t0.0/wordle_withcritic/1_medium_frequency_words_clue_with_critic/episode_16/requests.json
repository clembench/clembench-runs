You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

Some are:\n- Surrogacy (too long)\n- Normal\n- Young (referring to the mother)\n- Older (referring to the mother)\n- Wasted (miscarriage)\n- Tired (how the mother feels)\n\nHmm, I'm still not fully satisfied. Let me think more broadly.\n\nSome pregnancies are also described as:\n- Hoped\n- Bless (blessed)\n- Longed\n- Dream\n- Tricky\n- Rough\n\nAnd of course, there's \"LABOR\" which is 5 letters and relates to giving birth at the end of pregnancy.\n\nActually, a very common description for some pregnancies is \"HEAVY\" - referring to how a woman feels or looks during pregnancy.\n\nAnother important descriptor for some pregnancies is \"VALID\" - in the context of confirming a pregnancy.\n\nAh, I think I have a good one: \"UNWED\" - which describes pregnancies where the mother is not married. This is commonly used in phrases like \"unwed mother\" or \"unwed pregnancy.\"\n\nBut another very common term that directly relates to the clue \"like some pregnancies\" would be \"FIRST\" - as in a first pregnancy.\n\nI think I'll go with \"EARLY\" as my guess. It's a common description of pregnancies in their initial stages.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The clue is \"like some pregnancies.\" What are distinctive types or characteristics of pregnancies?\n\nSome pregnancies are also described as:\n- False (false pregnancy or false positive)\n- High-risk (too long)\n- Tubal (tubal pregnancy - an ectopic pregnancy in the fallopian tube)\n\n\"TUBAL\" is a good 5-letter word that specifically describes a type of pregnancy!\n\nActually, the most common distinction for pregnancies might simply be \"WOMEN\" as in \"women's pregnancies\" versus surrogacy or other arrangements. But that doesn't feel like the most specific answer.\n\nAnother key distinction is \"HUMAN\" pregnancies (versus animal pregnancies), which is 5 letters.\n\nI'm still not entirely satisfied. Let me think about this from another angle.\n\nThe clue is about what makes \"some pregnancies\" distinctive from others. What words describe specific types or states of pregnancies?\n\nSome pregnancies are:\n- SINGLE (versus multiple)\n- MULTI (not 5 letters)\n\nActually, a very common phrase is \"UNDUE hardship\" related to pregnancy complications.\n\nWait - I think I've got it. A very common term for some pregnancies is \"UNWED\" - referring to pregnancies outside of marriage. This has historically been an important social distinction.\n\nUNDUE - Another possibility is \"undue hardship\" or \"undue risk\" with pregnancy.\n\nOh, I just realized another obvious one: some pregnancies are \"HAPPY\" events, while others might not be - like unplanned pregnancies.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I think \"UNWED\" most directly answers the clue \"like some pregnancies\" because it's a specific description that applies to some pregnancies but not others.\n\nActually, another important distinction is between \"FIRST\" pregnancies and subsequent ones.\n\nBut I think a very clear and common distinction is between \"PLANN\" pregnancies and unplanned ones. But \"PLANN\" isn't a word - it would be \"PLANNED\" which has 7 letters.\n\nHow about just \"PLANS\" - as in \"pregnancy plans\"? Not quite right.\n\nActually, a really common description is that some pregnancies are \"TWINS\" - but that's not 5 letters.\n\nI'm going to go with \"UNWED\" as my final answer. It's a clear descriptor for some pregnancies (unwed pregnancies/unwed mothers), and it's 5 letters.\n\nActually, I think some pregnancies are also described as \"FALSE\" - as in false pregnancies or false positives. This is another good possibility.\n\nBetween \"UNWED\" and \"FALSE\", I think \"UNWED\" is more directly tied to the clue of \"like some pregnancies\".\n\nLet me make sure \"unwed\" is a valid English word: yes, it means \"not married\" and is commonly used in phrases like \"unwed mother\".\n\nOK, I'm going with \"UNWED\".", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: When describing types of pregnancies, one important distinction is between planned and unplanned pregnancies.
