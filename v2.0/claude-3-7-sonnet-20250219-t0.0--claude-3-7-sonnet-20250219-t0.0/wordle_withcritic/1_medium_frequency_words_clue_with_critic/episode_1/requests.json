You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess.

It's like saying \"look!\" or \"see!\" when wanting someone to notice something impressive or important.\n\nI need to come up with a 5-letter word that relates to this clue. Let me think about words that relate to seeing, looking, witnessing, or things that might evoke a \"behold!\" reaction.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- WATCH (to look at something)\n- SIGHT (something to see)\n- GAWCK (looking in awe, though usually spelled \"gawk\" with 4 letters)\n- GLARE (to look intently)\n- STARE (to look fixedly)\n- PEEKS (to look quickly)\n- GAZES (to look steadily)\n- LOOKS (to see)\n- VIEWS (to see)\n- BEAMS (light that you see)\n- SHINE (something bright that catches attention)\n- GLEAM (a bright light)\n- GLINT (a small flash of light)\n- FLASH (a sudden burst of light)\n- BLAZE (a bright flame)\n- GLOWS (emits light)\n- GLEAN (to gather information by looking)\n- TEARS (might be a reaction to something amazing)\n- SMILE (might be a reaction to something impressive)\n- GAZES (to look steadily)\n- GAPES (to stare with mouth open)\n- BEHLD (shortened \"behold\", but not a real word)\n- AMAZE (to astonish - something that might make you say \"behold!\")\n- SHOCK (to surprise greatly)\n- WOWZA (expression of amazement, but not standard)\n\nFrom these options, I need a 5-letter word that's a valid English word.
