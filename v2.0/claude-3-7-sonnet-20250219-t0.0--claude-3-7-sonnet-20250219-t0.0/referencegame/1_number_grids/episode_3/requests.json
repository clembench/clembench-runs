Distinctive features of the target grid:\n   - The target has 3 full rows of X's (rows 1, 3, and 5)\n   - The target has a vertical line of X's in column 4\n   - The target has a symmetrical pattern with rows 2 and 4 being identical\n   - The target forms an \"E\" shape if viewed from the right side\n\nThe most distinctive feature appears to be that the target grid has 3 complete rows of X's, while neither distractor has this property.\n\nPossible referring expressions:\n1. \"The grid with three complete rows of X's\"\n2. \"The grid that forms an E shape when viewed from the right\"\n3. \"The grid with X's filling the entire first, third, and fifth rows\"\n4. \"The grid with a vertical line in column 4 and three complete horizontal rows\"\n5. \"The grid where rows 1, 3, and 5 are completely filled with X's\"\n\nLet me verify that these uniquely identify the target:\n\nExpression 1: \"The grid with three complete rows of X's\"\n- Target: Yes, rows 1, 3, and 5 are complete\n- Distractor 1: No, no row is completely filled with X's\n- Distractor 2: No, only row 1 is completely filled with X's\n\nThis expression uniquely identifies the target grid.\n\nExpression 2: \"The grid that forms an E shape when viewed from the right\"\n- Target: Yes, it forms an E shape from the right\n- Distractor 1: No, it doesn't form an E shape\n- Distractor 2: No, it doesn't form an E shape\n\nThis expression also uniquely identifies the target grid.\n\nExpression 3: \"The grid with X's filling the entire first, third, and fifth rows\"\n- Target: Yes, rows 1, 3, and 5 are filled\n- Distractor 1: No, row 1 is not completely filled\n- Distractor 2: No, row 5 is not completely filled\n\nThis expression uniquely identifies the target grid.\n\nExpression 4: \"The grid with a vertical line in column 4 and three complete horizontal rows\"\n- Target: Yes, has a vertical line in column 4 and three complete rows\n- Distractor 1: Has X's in column 4 but not three complete rows\n- Distractor 2: Does not have three complete rows\n\nThis expression uniquely identifies the target grid.\n\nExpression 5: \"The grid where rows 1, 3, and 5 are completely filled with X's\"\n- Target: Yes, rows 1, 3, and 5 are completely filled\n- Distractor 1: No, row 1 is not completely filled\n- Distractor 2: No, row 5 is not completely filled\n\nThis expression uniquely identifies the target grid.\n\nI think the clearest and most concise option is Expression 5: \"The grid where rows 1, 3, and 5 are completely filled with X's\".
