Top row (row 1):\n   - Target: All Xs\n   - Distractor 1: Four Xs and one empty cell at the right\n   - Distractor 2: All Xs\n   So the top row matches with Distractor 2 but differs from Distractor 1.\n\n2. Second row (row 2):\n   - Target: One X at the left, rest empty\n   - Distractor 1: All empty except X in fourth position\n   - Distractor 2: All empty except X in fourth position\n   The target has a different pattern in the second row compared to both distractors.\n\n3. Middle row (row 3):\n   - Target: All Xs\n   - Distractor 1: All Xs except the rightmost cell\n   - Distractor 2: All Xs\n   The middle row matches with Distractor 2 but differs from Distractor 1.\n\n4. Fourth row (row 4):\n   - Target: X at the left, three empty cells, X at the right\n   - Distractor 1: X at the left, rest empty\n   - Distractor 2: All empty except X in fourth position\n   The fourth row is unique in the target compared to both distractors.\n\n5. Bottom row (row 5):\n   - Target: All Xs\n   - Distractor 1: All Xs\n   - Distractor 2: All Xs\n   All grids have the same pattern in the bottom row.\n\n6. Overall shape/pattern:\n   - Target: Has a symmetrical pattern with a border of Xs and empty cells in the middle (except for the second row which has one X)\n   - Both distractors lack this symmetry\n\nKey distinguishing features of the target:\n1. It has a complete X border around most of the grid\n2. The second row has an X only in the first position (left side)\n3. The fourth row has Xs at both the left and right edges\n\nLet me create a concise referring expression:\n\n\"The grid with a complete border of Xs and empty cells in the middle\"\n\nWait, that's not quite right, since the second row doesn't complete the border.

Let me be more specific:\n\n\"The grid with Xs along all edges and X in the top-left of the second row\"\n\nI think I can be even more precise about the pattern:\n\n\"The grid where all rows begin and end with X, with the top, middle, and bottom rows filled entirely with Xs\"\n\nThis should uniquely identify the target grid from the distractors.
