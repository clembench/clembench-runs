First row:\n   - Target: \"X X X X □\" (4 Xs, then empty)\n   - Distractor 1: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Distractor 2: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Difference: The target has an empty cell in the top-right corner; both distractors have a filled cell there.\n\n2. Second row:\n   - Target: \"□ □ □ X □\" (3 empty, 1 X, 1 empty)\n   - Distractor 1: \"□ □ □ X □\" (3 empty, 1 X, 1 empty)\n   - Distractor 2: \"X □ □ □ □\" (1 X, 4 empty)\n   - Difference: The target and distractor 1 have the same pattern, but distractor 2 has an X on the left.\n\n3. Third row:\n   - Target: \"X X X X □\" (4 Xs, then empty)\n   - Distractor 1: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Distractor 2: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Difference: The target has an empty cell in the right corner; both distractors have a filled cell there.\n\n4. Fourth row:\n   - Target: \"X □ □ □ □\" (1 X, 4 empty)\n   - Distractor 1: \"□ □ □ X □\" (3 empty, 1 X, 1 empty)\n   - Distractor 2: \"X □ □ □ X\" (1 X, 3 empty, 1 X)\n   - Difference: All have different patterns. The target has an X on the left only.\n\n5. Fifth row:\n   - Target: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Distractor 1: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Distractor 2: \"X X X X X\" (all Xs)\n   - Difference: No difference, all have a filled bottom row.\n\nKey distinguishing features of the target:\n1.
