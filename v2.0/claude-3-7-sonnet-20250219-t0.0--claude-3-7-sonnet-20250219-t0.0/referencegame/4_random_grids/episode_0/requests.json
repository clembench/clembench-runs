I'll compare all three grids to find distinctive features of the target grid.\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX □ X □ X\n□ X X X □\nX X □ X X\n□ X X X □\nX □ X □ X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n```\nX □ X X X\nX X X □ X\nX X □ X X\nX X X □ X\nX □ X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n```\nX □ X □ □\nX □ □ □ X\nX □ □ X X\n□ X □ □ X\nX □ X X X\n```\n\nFirst, let me analyze the patterns and structures in each grid:\n\nTarget grid:\n- I notice a checkerboard-like pattern in the corners (X □ X □ X in the first and last rows)\n- The grid has rotational symmetry around the center\n- The middle position (row 3, column 3) is empty\n- The grid has an 'X' shape in the middle surrounded by a pattern of filled and empty cells\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n- Has more filled cells than the target grid\n- The pattern is different - more filled cells on the left and right columns\n- Middle position is also empty\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n- Has fewer filled cells than the target grid\n- More scattered pattern\n- Middle position is empty\n\nKey distinguishing features of the target grid:\n1. Symmetrical pattern - if you rotate it 90 degrees, it looks the same\n2. X-shaped pattern in the middle\n3. Checkerboard pattern in the corners\n4. The first and last rows match (X □ X □ X)\n5. The first and last columns match (X □ X □ X)\n6. The second and fourth rows match (□ X X X □)\n\nI think the most distinctive feature is the diagonal symmetry and the pattern of the first/last rows and columns. Let me formulate a clear expression:\n\nPotential referring expressions:\n1. \"The grid with X □ X □ X pattern in both the first and last rows\"\n2. \"The grid with diagonal symmetry that forms a diamond pattern\"\n3. \"The grid with X marks forming an X-like shape in the center\"\n4. \"The grid where the corners and center form an X pattern\"\n5. \"The grid with checkerboard pattern in the corners and an X in the middle\"\n6. \"The grid with rotational symmetry where the filled cells form a diamond shape\"\n\nI think the most distinctive feature is the symmetrical pattern in the first/last rows and columns, combined with the X-shape in the middle.
