It has most of its cells filled (21 out of 25)\n2. It has only 4 empty cells arranged in a scattered pattern\n3. The empty cells appear in columns 1, 2, and 3\n4. There are empty cells in every row\n5. The grid looks mostly filled with a few strategic empty cells\n\nFor a referring expression, I should focus on these distinctive features while being concise and clear:\n\nPotential expressions:\n1. \"The grid with only 4 empty cells scattered diagonally\"\n2. \"The mostly filled grid with empty cells at positions (0,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,1)\"\n3. \"The grid where each row has exactly one empty cell\"\n4. \"The grid that is almost completely filled, with only 4 scattered empty spaces\"\n5. \"The grid where empty cells form a zigzag pattern from top to bottom\"\n\nLet me check if each row indeed has exactly one empty cell as I suggested in option 3:\n- Row 0: Empty at (0,1) ✓\n- Row 1: Empty at (1,3) ✓\n- Row 2: Empty at (2,2) ✓\n- Row 3: Empty at (3,3) ✓\n- Row 4: Empty at (4,1) ✓\n\nYes, each row has exactly one empty cell. This is a very distinctive feature that doesn't apply to either distractor.\n\nI should also check if my description of \"zigzag pattern\" or \"diagonal-like\" is accurate:\nLooking at the positions (0,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1), it does form a kind of zigzag rather than a perfect diagonal.\n\nLet me count another way: Let's check the number of empty cells in each column:\n- Column 0: 0 empty cells\n- Column 1: 2 empty cells (rows 0 and 4)\n- Column 2: 1 empty cell (row 2)\n- Column 3: 2 empty cells (rows 1 and 3)\n- Column 4: 0 empty cells\n\nSo the target grid has empty cells only in columns 1, 2, and 3, with columns 0 and 4 being completely filled.\n\nThe most concise and clear referring expression would be: \"The grid where each row has exactly one empty cell.\"\n\nThis captures a key distinctive feature that doesn't apply to either distractor and is easy to verify.\n\nWait, I should double-check my count of empty cells in the target grid. Looking at it again:\n```\nX □ X X X\nX X X □ X\nX X □ X X\nX X X □ X\nX □ X X X\n```\n\nI see empty cells at:\n(0,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,1) - that's 5 empty cells, not 4 as I initially counted.\n\nSo the target grid has 20 X's and 5 empty cells.\n\nLet me confirm my observation about each row having exactly one empty cell:\n- Row 0: Empty at (0,1) ✓\n- Row 1: Empty at (1,3) ✓\n- Row 2: Empty at (2,2) ✓\n- Row 3: Empty at (3,3) ✓\n- Row 4: Empty at (4,1) ✓\n\nYes, each row still has exactly one empty cell.\n\nI'll revise my expression to: \"The grid where each row has exactly one empty cell and contains 20 filled cells.\"\n\nActually, I think just saying \"The grid where each row has exactly one empty cell\" is sufficient and clearer.
