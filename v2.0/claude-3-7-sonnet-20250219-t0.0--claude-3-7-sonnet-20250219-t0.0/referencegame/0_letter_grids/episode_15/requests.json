Let me examine each grid carefully.\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ X\nX X X X X\nX X □ □ □\nX X □ □ □\n```\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n```\nX X X X X\nX X □ □ □\nX X X X X\nX X □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\n```\n\nLet me identify the distinguishing features of the target grid:\n\n1. First row: All Xs in all grids, so not distinctive.\n2. Second row: In the target grid, it's \"X □ □ □ X\" - this pattern differs from both distractors. \n   - Distractor 1 has \"X X □ □ □\"\n   - Distractor 2 has \"X □ □ □ □\"\n   - The key difference is that the target has an X at the right edge (column 5) while Distractor 1 doesn't have it and Distractor 2 has an empty space there.\n3. Third row: In the target grid, it's all Xs, which matches Distractor 1 but differs from Distractor 2.\n4. Fourth row: In the target grid, it's \"X X □ □ □\", which matches Distractor 1 in this row but differs from Distractor 2.\n5. Fifth row: In the target grid, it's \"X X □ □ □\", which differs from both distractors. Distractor 1 has all Xs, and Distractor 2 has mostly empty spaces.\n\nLooking at the overall structure:\n- The target grid has a distinctive pattern with Xs forming what looks like a capital letter \"E\" (or almost like one) with the right edge of the second row having an X.\n- The target grid has a complete border of Xs on the top, left side, and a partial border on the right side (just the top two rows).\n- The target grid has a horizontal line of Xs in the middle (third row).\n\nSome potential distinguishing descriptions:\n1. \"Grid with an X in the top-right corner and empty spaces in the bottom-right\"\n2. \"Grid resembling the letter E with a gap in the right side of the middle row\"\n3. \"Grid with three rows of Xs at the top, and two columns of Xs on the left\"\n4. \"Grid with X pattern forming three horizontal lines at the top, with the middle row having an X on both ends\"\n\nLooking at the most distinctive feature, I think the pattern of the second row with \"X □ □ □ X\" (having Xs at both ends) is unique to the target grid. Combined with the other features, I'll create a concise referring expression.\n\nThe most distinctive feature seems to be the second row having an X at both ends, while the bottom right quarter is empty.
