Specifically, columns 1, 3, and 5 are filled with X, while columns 2 and 4 are empty. This creates a vertical striped pattern with X's in columns 1, 3, and 5.\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n```\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 1 has columns 3, 4, and 5 filled with X, while columns 1 and 2 are empty. This creates a pattern where the right side of the grid is filled.\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n```\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 2 has rows 1, 3, and 5 filled with X, while rows 2 and 4 are empty. This creates a horizontal striped pattern.\n\nNow, let me generate a referring expression that clearly distinguishes the target grid:\n\nThe key distinguishing features of the target grid are:\n1. It has vertical stripes of X's and empty cells\n2. The X's appear in columns 1, 3, and 5\n3. The empty cells appear in columns 2 and 4\n4. Every row has the same pattern\n\nSome possible expressions:\n- \"The grid with vertical stripes where columns 1, 3, and 5 contain X's\"\n- \"The grid with alternating columns of X's and empty cells\"\n- \"The grid where every column is either all X's or all empty, creating vertical stripes\"\n- \"The grid with vertical lines of X's in columns 1, 3, and 5\"\n\nI think the clearest expression would be \"The grid with alternating columns, where columns 1, 3, and 5 are filled with X's and columns 2 and 4 are empty\". This clearly distinguishes it from both distractors.\n\nTherefore, my referring expression is:\nExpression: The grid with alternating columns, where columns 1, 3, and 5 are filled with X's and columns 2 and 4 are empty.\n\nActually, I can be more concise. Let me try again:\nExpression: The grid with vertical stripes where columns 1, 3, and 5 contain X's.\n\nBut I think what makes the target grid most distinctive is that it has vertical stripes of alternating filled and empty columns.
