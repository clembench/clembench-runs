'count' - either a nobleman title or the act of counting\n4. 'marques' - a nobleman title (higher than count)\n5. 'overwhelmed' - feeling overcome by emotions or large quantities\n6.

'blackmailing' - the act of demanding money by threats\n\nMy strategy will be to divide the words into categories and ask questions that can eliminate about half the words each time.\n\nFirst, I notice some words are professions/people (postman, policeman), some are emotions/states (overwhelmed, confusion), some are actions (speeding, blackmailing, count if used as a verb), and some are titles (count, marques if used as a title).\n\nMy questions should try to narrow down these categories efficiently:\n\nQuestion 1: I'll try to separate based on whether the word relates to a person or a role someone can have.\n\"Is the target word related to a person or a role someone can have?\"\nIf yes: postman, policeman, count, marques\nIf no: overwhelmed, confusion, speeding, blackmailing\n\nWait, that's not quite right because \"blackmailing\" is something a person does.
