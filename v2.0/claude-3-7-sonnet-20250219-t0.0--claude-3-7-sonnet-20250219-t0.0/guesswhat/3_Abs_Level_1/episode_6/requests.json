Let me ask one final question to confirm this.\n\nI could ask if the target word is a short, one-syllable word, which would help differentiate between 'art' (one syllable) and 'craft' (one syllable). But that would be asking about the structure of the word, which isn't allowed.\n\nPerhaps I could ask if the target word refers to something that's typically displayed in museums or galleries, which would point more to 'art' than 'craft'.\n\nActually, I think I have enough information to make a guess.
