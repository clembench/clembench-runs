All of these words can function as nouns except 'sulky' which is primarily an adjective. That would be 7 out of 8, which isn't very efficient.\n\nI could ask if the word has positive connotations. 'Uncle', 'grandparent', 'birthday' would generally be positive; 'funeral', 'intimidation', 'sulky' would be negative; 'cell' and 'oceanography' are neutral.
