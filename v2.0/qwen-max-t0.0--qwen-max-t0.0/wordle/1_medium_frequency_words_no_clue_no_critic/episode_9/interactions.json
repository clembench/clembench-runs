This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:59:48.051790", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word with a mix of frequently used letters, which makes it a good starting point to gather information about the target word.\nguess: crate"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:59:48.052203", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = koala\nguess = crate\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<green> t<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:59:48.052402", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<green> t<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:59:50.628241", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that only the letter 'a' is correct and in the correct position.
