	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: 1967 uris novel\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue refers to a novel by Leon Uris published in 1967. One of his well-known novels is "Trinity," but since that doesn't fit the 5-letter requirement, another possibility is "QB VII," which is a famous work by Uris. However, "QB VII" is not a standard English word. Another option is "exodus," but it has more than five letters. A 5-letter word connected to Uris and his works could be "uris'" related themes, such as "siege," which is a military situation often described in historical novels.\\ \tt guess: siege

	 explanation: All letters in "siege" were marked as incorrect, so none of those letters are in the target word. The clue points to a 1967 Uris novel, so I will try another 5-letter word associated with his works or themes. Another possibility is "topaz," which is a thriller novel by Uris published in 1967.\\ \tt guess: topaz
