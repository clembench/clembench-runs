You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:44:12.674424", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start by guessing a common five-letter English word to get an initial sense of the letters involved.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:44:12.674733", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = tubal\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:44:12.674887", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:44:14.466554", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"u\" is present in the word but not in the correct position.
