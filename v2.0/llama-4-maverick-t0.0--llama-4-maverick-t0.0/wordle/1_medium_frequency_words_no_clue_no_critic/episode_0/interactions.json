This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:41:46.123458", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start by guessing a common five-letter English word to get an initial sense of the letters.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:41:46.123754", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = squat\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<green> s<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:41:46.123896", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<green> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:41:47.216534", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"u\" is correct and in the right position, \"s\" is correct but in the wrong position, and the letters \"h\", \"o\", and \"e\" are incorrect.
