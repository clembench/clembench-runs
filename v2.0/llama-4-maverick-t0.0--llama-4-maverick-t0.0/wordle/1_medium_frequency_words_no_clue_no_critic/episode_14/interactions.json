You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:46.940623", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start by guessing a common five-letter English word to get an initial feedback.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:46.940961", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:46.941220", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:47.751388", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all the letters in the previous guess \"house\" are marked red, I will try a new word that has different letters to maximize the chance of getting at least one correct letter. \nguess: fjord"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:47.751719", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = fjord\nguess_feedback = f<red> j<red> o<red> r<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:47.751968", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> j<red> o<red> r<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:43:49.122735", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"r\" is marked yellow, indicating it is present in the target word but not in the correct position.
