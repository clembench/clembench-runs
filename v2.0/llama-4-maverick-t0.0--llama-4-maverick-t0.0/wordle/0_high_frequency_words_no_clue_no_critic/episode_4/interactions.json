This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:40:58.230192", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start by guessing a common five-letter English word to get an initial sense of the letters involved.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:40:58.230487", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = forum\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<green> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:40:58.230633", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<yellow> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-04-08T13:40:59.887447", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"o\" is in the correct position, \"u\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and the letters \"h\", \"s\", and \"e\" are not in the word.
