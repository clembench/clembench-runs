You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:14:29.703250", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start with a common word that has several vowels to get an idea of which vowels are in the target word.\nguess: about"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:14:29.703542", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = today\nguess = about\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> b<red> o<yellow> u<red> t<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:14:29.703693", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> b<red> o<yellow> u<red> t<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:14:30.922456", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters 'a', 'o', and 't' are in the word, but not in the positions I guessed.
