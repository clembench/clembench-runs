This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: cicero speaking site, with \"the\"\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T23:34:37.794059", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The clue refers to a famous speech by Cicero, which is often associated with the phrase \"Cicero's oration.\" The word \"oration\" has five letters and fits the criteria of the game.\nguess: orate"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T23:34:37.794421", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = forum\ntarget_word_clue = cicero speaking site, with \"the\"\nguess = orate\nguess_feedback = o<yellow> r<yellow> a<red> t<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T23:34:37.794513", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: o<yellow> r<yellow> a<red> t<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T23:34:42.476859", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"o\" and \"r\" are in the word but in the wrong position.
