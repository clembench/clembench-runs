Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Are there any variations in the spacing or alignment of the symbols in your grid that might differ from the perfectly uniform pattern described?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: No, there are no variations in the spacing or alignment of the symbols. The grid follows a perfectly uniform pattern as described.\nQUESTION: Does your grid contain any additional elements or characters outside of the defined 5x5 boundary that could potentially differentiate it from mine?

Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Is the scale or the physical representation of your grid exactly the same as described, or is there any difference in how the grid is depicted, such as being larger or smaller in size?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: The scale and physical representation of my grid are exactly as described. There is no difference in how the grid is depicted; it is neither larger nor smaller in size.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:16:48.603876", "call_duration": "0:00:01.134482", "response": "DECISION: same grid", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
