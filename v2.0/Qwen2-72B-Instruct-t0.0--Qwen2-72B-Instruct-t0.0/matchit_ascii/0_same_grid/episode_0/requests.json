Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Is there any color associated with the characters or the background of your grid, or is it purely text-based without any color differentiation?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: There is no color associated with the characters or the background of my grid. It is purely text-based without any color differentiation.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:13:31.846747", "call_duration": "0:00:01.138348", "response": "DECISION: same grid", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
