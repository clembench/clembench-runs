The edges of the grid are filled with 'X' symbols, while the inner 3x3 section consists of empty squares represented by '▢'.\nQUESTION: Are there any 'X' symbols present in the inner 3x3 section of your grid besides the center and the four corners? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, there is an 'X' symbol in the inner 3x3 section, specifically in the middle of one of the sides.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any 'X' symbols in the inner 3x3 section that are not located at the very center or on the edges of the grid?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: No, there are no 'X' symbols in the inner 3x3 section except for the borders where they form the frame of the grid.\nQUESTION: In your grid, are the 'X' symbols on the inner 3x3 section placed symmetrically around the center 'X'? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, the 'X' symbols on the inner 3x3 section are placed symmetrically around the center, forming a smaller square.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: different grids<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:39:04.902859", "call_duration": "0:00:01.161563", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
