Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a symmetrical pattern when looking at the distribution of 'X's and empty spaces?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has a symmetrical pattern when looking at the distribution of 'X's and empty spaces.\nQUESTION: Are there any 'X's placed on the edges of your grid, excluding the corners? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, there are 'X's placed on the edges of the grid, excluding the corners.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid have an equal number of 'X's and empty spaces ('▢') or is there an imbalance between the two?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: There is an imbalance between the number of 'X's and empty spaces ('▢') in my grid.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: different grids<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:41:54.086865", "call_duration": "0:00:01.132990", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
