Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

The presence in the first, fourth, and fifth rows does not specify column locations beyond what has been described. However, given the description provided, it implies that the X's in these rows would align with the pattern described for the second row, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

It is filled with X's in the third and fifth columns, and the rest of the positions in that row are unspecified but implied to be empty based on the overall pattern and description given.\nQUESTION: In your grid, are there any X's placed diagonally from the top left to the bottom right, similar to the pattern in my grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, there are no X's placed diagonally from the top left to the bottom right in my grid.
