Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where the top row and left column are filled with 'X', and the rest of the cells are empty represented by '▢'.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with cells, where most cells are empty (denoted by squares), except for a diagonal line of 'X's starting from the third cell of the first row down to the last cell of the fifth row, and a full last column of 'X's. The pattern of 'X's forms an L-shape.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any 'X' symbols in the cells that are not part of the top row or the left column?

It does not start from the first cell of the first row.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
