All other rows contain '□' symbols.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Are there any columns in your grid that are completely filled with 'X'?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: No, there are no columns completely filled with 'X'. The first column has 'X' at the top and bottom but the middle is empty.\nQUESTION: In your grid, are there any 'X's present in the corners other than the ones in the first column and the last row? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, there are no 'X's in the corners other than the ones in the first column and the last row.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any rows where the pattern of 'X's and empty spaces is mirrored horizontally across the center of the grid?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: Yes, the pattern of 'X's and empty spaces in the second and fourth rows is mirrored horizontally across the center of the grid.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns where the pattern of 'X's and empty spaces is mirrored vertically across the center of the grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, there are no columns where the pattern of 'X's and empty spaces is mirrored vertically across the center of the grid.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: different grids<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:26:19.922454", "call_duration": "0:00:01.131692", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
