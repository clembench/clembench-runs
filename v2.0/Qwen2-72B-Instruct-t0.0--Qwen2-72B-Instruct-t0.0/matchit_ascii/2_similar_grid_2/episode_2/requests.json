All 'X' on the edges are either at the corners or are consecutive.\nQUESTION: In the center empty space of your grid, are the edges surrounding it completely made up of 'X', or are there any '□' interrupting the 'X' around the perimeter of the center? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: The edges surrounding the center empty space of my grid are completely made up of 'X', with no '□' interrupting the 'X' around the perimeter of the center.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid have rotational symmetry, meaning if you rotate it 180 degrees, does it look the same as before?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has rotational symmetry; if you rotate it 180 degrees, it looks the same as before.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 08:32:30.901020", "call_duration": "0:00:01.134409", "response": "DECISION: same grid", "model_name": "Qwen2-72B-Instruct"}}}]
