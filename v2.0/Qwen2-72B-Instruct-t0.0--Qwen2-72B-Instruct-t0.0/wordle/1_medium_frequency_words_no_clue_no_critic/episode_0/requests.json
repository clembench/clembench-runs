Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Starting with a common word that contains a variety of letters to get initial feedback.\nguess: crane<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Since 'a' is yellow, it's in the word but not in the right place. I'll try placing 'a' elsewhere and use different letters based on the feedback.\nguess: brail<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> a<yellow> i<red> l<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: 'a' is still misplaced, so I'll keep trying different positions for it. I'll also avoid the red letters and try new ones.\nguess: quack<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: q<yellow> u<yellow> a<yellow> c<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The yellow feedback suggests that 'q', 'u', and 'a' are in the word but misplaced. I'll rearrange these letters and add two new ones.\nguess: aquae<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: a<red> q<green> u<green> a<green> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: I now know the correct letters are 'q', 'u', and 'a', but 'a' appears twice and the second one is misplaced.
