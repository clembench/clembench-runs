	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to guess a target word that another player describes to you.\\ \tt \\ \tt You can make one guess at each trial.

	 Okay, so the clue is about a way to enter or exit something like a plane or a ship. Hmm, planes and ships have specific openings for people to go in and out. For planes, I think of doors, but they're not just any doors; they're special ones. And ships also have entrances and exits, but they might be called something different.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me think about plane doors first. I know that planes have doors, but they're probably not what this is about because the
