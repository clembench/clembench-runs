	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to guess a target word that another player describes to you.\\ \tt \\ \tt You can make one guess at each trial.

	 Okay, so I have to guess a word based on the clues given. The first clue is "It's about being sensible and not dreaming too much." Hmm, being sensible means being practical and realistic, right? So maybe it's a word that describes someone who is down-to-earth and doesn't have unrealistic expectations.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me think about words that relate to being sensible and practical. Maybe "pragmatic" fits here. Pragmatic means practical and realistic, not getting carried away with unrealistic
