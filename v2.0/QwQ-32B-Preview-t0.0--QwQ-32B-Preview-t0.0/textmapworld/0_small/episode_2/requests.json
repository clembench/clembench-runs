I need to be efficient in my movements and make sure I cover every room without unnecessary backtracking or extra steps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the layout of the rooms and how they are connected. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to build one in my mind as I go along. Each room will be a node, and the directions will represent the edges connecting these nodes.\n\n", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 19:31:32.850674", "call_duration": "0:00:08.092901", "response": "Alright, I'm starting this task of exploring all the rooms with as few room changes as possible.
