So, I need to be efficient in my path. I should probably keep track of which rooms I've already visited so I don't go back to the same one again unless necessary.\n\nStarting in the Basement, with options to go west or east. I need to choose one direction first. Let's see, maybe I should pick west first. So, I'll go west.\n\nYou", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 19:32:54.293218", "call_duration": "0:00:08.073067", "response": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes.
