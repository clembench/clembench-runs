	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Balcony. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?

	 I'm trying to figure out the best way to explore all these rooms with as few room changes as possible. It sounds like I need to visit every room at least once, and I want to do it efficiently. The way to do this seems similar to finding a path that covers all the nodes in a graph with the least number of steps, maybe like a depth-first search or something.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Balcony, I have options to go south or west. I should choose one direction and
