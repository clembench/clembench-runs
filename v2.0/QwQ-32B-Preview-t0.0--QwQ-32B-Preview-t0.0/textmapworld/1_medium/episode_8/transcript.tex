	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?

	 Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes. So, I need to be strategic about which direction I choose at each step to cover everything efficiently. I should probably keep track of which rooms I've already visited to avoid going back to the same room multiple times.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's start. I'm in the Billiard room, and I can go south or west. I need to decide which direction to choose first. Maybe I should choose
