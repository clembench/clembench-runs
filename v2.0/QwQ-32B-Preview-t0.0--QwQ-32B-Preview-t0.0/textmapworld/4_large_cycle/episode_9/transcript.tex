	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next command?

	 Alright, I'm starting this exploration task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with as few room changes as possible. That means I want to be efficient and not backtrack or go through rooms more times than necessary.\\ \tt \\ \tt I'm beginning in the Cellar, and from here, I can go south, west, or east. I need to decide which direction to choose first. Since it's the starting point, maybe I should choose the direction that leads to the most other rooms or perhaps just pick
