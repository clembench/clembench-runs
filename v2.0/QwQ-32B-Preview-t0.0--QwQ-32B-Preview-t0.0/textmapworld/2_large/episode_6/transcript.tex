	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Library. Currently available directions: west, north. What is your next command?

	 I'm in the Library, and I can go west or north. I need to visit all the rooms with as few room changes as possible. That sounds like I should try to cover as much ground as I can in each path before backtracking. So, I should choose a direction and stick with it as long as there are new rooms to visit.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me choose to go north first. So, my first command is GO: north.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, I'm in a new room. Let's
