	 ANSWER: In my grid, there is no specific diagonal pattern of 'X's. The 'X's are arranged in rows with specific empty cells as described earlier.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
