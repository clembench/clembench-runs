In my grid, the top row has all X's, so the first cell is X with left being non-existent, top being non-existent, right being X, and bottom being X. So no, because its adjacent cells include X's. Let's see another cell. The cell at position (2,5) is ▢, with left being X, top being X, right being non-existent, and bottom being ▢. Not matching.
