	 ANSWER: Let me count the 'X's in my grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Row 1: 1 'X'\\ \tt \\ \tt - Row 2: 2 'X's\\ \tt \\ \tt - Row 3: 5 'X's\\ \tt \\ \tt - Row 4: 3 'X's\\ \tt \\ \tt - Row 5: 1 'X'\\ \tt \\ \tt Total 'X's: 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 'X's.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
