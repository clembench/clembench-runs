The first row has 'X's in the first and fifth columns, and the other rows have only one 'X' each.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns where all cells are 'X's? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, in my grid, no column has all cells filled with 'X's. The first column has 'X's in the first and second rows, the second column has 'X's in the second and third rows, and so on, but none have all five rows filled with 'X's.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
