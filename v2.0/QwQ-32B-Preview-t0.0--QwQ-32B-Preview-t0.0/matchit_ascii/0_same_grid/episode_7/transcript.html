    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: There appears to be some horizontal symmetry in the grid. The first three rows are identical, and the fifth row seems to mirror the pattern of the first row, but with an &#x27;X&#x27; in the first position and empty squares following. The fourth row has a different pattern with &#x27;X&#x27;s in the second and fourth positions and empty squares elsewhere. So, it seems there is a form of horizontal symmetry, but not perfect mirror symmetry across the center row due to the differences in the fourth</p>

        <p>ANSWER: Looking at the grid, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a prominent diagonal pattern or lines of &#x27;X&#x27;s running diagonally. The &#x27;X&#x27;s are mostly aligned horizontally in the first three rows, and in specific positions in the fourth and fifth rows without forming a diagonal line.
