The arrangement is such that &#x27;X&#x27;s are placed in a somewhat symmetrical pattern, but not strictly so. For instance, in the center row, there&#x27;s an &#x27;X&#x27; in the third position, but it&#x27;s flanked by empty squares on both sides. So, while there is some symmetry, it&#x27;s not perfectly radial.</p>
