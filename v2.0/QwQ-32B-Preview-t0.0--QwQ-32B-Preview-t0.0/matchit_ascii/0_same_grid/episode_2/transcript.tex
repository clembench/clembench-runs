	 ANSWER: The 'X's in my grid form a somewhat symmetrical pattern, but it's not a standard shape like a plus sign or a cross. It's more of an abstract design with balanced distribution of 'X's and empty squares.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
