	 ANSWER: In my grid, the fourth row has one empty square followed by four 'X's. It's similar to the other rows in that it has a sequence of 'X's with some empty squares at the beginning.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, in your grid, you've described the first row as having an empty square, followed by three 'X's, and ending with an empty square. Could you specify if the empty squares are at the beginning and the end, or are they in different positions?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
