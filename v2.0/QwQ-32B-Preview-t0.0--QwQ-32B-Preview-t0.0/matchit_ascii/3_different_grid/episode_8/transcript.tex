	 ANSWER: In my grid, there is no diagonal pattern of 'X's from the top-right to the bottom-left or any other diagonal orientation. The 'X's are strictly arranged in rows, increasing by one in each subsequent row from the top to the bottom.\\ \tt QUESTION: So, in your grid, the 'X's are arranged in a lower triangular pattern, with each row having one more 'X' than the previous row, and no 'X's above that in the rows? Is\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
