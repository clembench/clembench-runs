Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

The first row has 'X' in the first and fifth positions, and blanks in between. The second row is similar to the first. The third row is entirely 'X's. The fourth and fifth rows are like the first and second, with 'X's at the start and end, and blanks in the middle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 matrix with squares that are either filled (X) or empty (▢).
