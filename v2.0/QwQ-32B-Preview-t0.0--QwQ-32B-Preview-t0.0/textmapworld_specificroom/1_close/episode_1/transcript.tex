	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Library. You are in the Basement. Currently available directions: east, north, south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Alright, so I'm trying to find the Library starting from the Basement. The available directions from here are east, north, and south. I need to decide which way to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, I don't know the layout of the rooms, so I'll have to explore step by step. Maybe I should choose one direction and see where it leads. Let's consider going north first.\\ \tt \\ \tt If I go north from the Basement, maybe I'll find the Library directly, or at least get closer
