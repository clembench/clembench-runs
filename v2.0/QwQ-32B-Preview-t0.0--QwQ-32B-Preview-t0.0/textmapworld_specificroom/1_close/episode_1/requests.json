The available directions from here are east, north, and south. I need to decide which way to go first.\n\nHmm, I don't know the layout of the rooms, so I'll have to explore step by step. Maybe I should choose one direction and see where it leads. Let's consider going north first.\n\nIf I go north from the Basement, maybe I'll find the Library directly, or at least get closer", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 21:53:30.148053", "call_duration": "0:00:07.995294", "response": "Alright, so I'm trying to find the Library starting from the Basement.
