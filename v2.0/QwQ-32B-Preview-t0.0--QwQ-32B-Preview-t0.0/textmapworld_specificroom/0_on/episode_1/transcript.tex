	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Basement. You are in the Basement. Currently available directions: east, north, south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 I'm a bit confused here. The target room is the Basement, and I'm already in the Basement. So, do I need to stay here or move to another room? Wait, maybe I need to explore the Basement or something. But the instruction says that once I've found the target room, I should answer with "DONE." So, since I'm already in the Basement, which is the target room, maybe I should just say "DONE" right away.\\ \tt \\ \tt But let me think about
