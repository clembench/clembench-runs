Since I'm in the Conservatory and the only exit is to the south, it seems like the Conservatory is at the northern end of the map. Maybe there's a room to the south of it, and that's the only neighboring room", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 21:52:40.691990", "call_duration": "0:00:07.976843", "response": "I'm trying to solve this room exploration task.
