	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Living room. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 I'm a bit confused here. The target room is the Living room, and I'm already in the Living room. So, do I need to stay here or move to another room and then come back or what? The instructions say to explore rooms and find the target room, but I'm already in it. Maybe I should just answer "DONE" since I'm already in the target room.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to explore all rooms or something.
