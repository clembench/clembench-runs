	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Cellar. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Let's see. The target room is the Cellar, and I'm currently in the Cellar. That's great! So, I don't need to go anywhere else because I'm already in the target room. Therefore, I should just say "DONE" because there's no need to move to another room.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, it says that from the Cellar, I can go east or north. Maybe there are other rooms connected to the Cellar, but since my target is the Cell
