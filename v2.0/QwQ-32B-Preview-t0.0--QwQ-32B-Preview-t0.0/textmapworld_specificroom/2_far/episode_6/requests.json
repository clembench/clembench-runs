I need to decide which one to choose first.\n\nFirst, I should probably think about the layout of the rooms. Since I'm in the Cellar, which might be basement level, maybe the north direction leads upwards, while east could lead to other parts of the basement. But I'm not really sure about that. Maybe I should just pick one direction", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-22 21:55:30.978460", "call_duration": "0:00:07.980518", "response": "Alright, so I'm trying to find my way to the Bedroom starting from the Cellar.
