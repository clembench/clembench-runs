	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Bedroom. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Alright, so I'm trying to find my way to the Bedroom starting from the Cellar. I have two directions available: east and north. I need to decide which one to choose first.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably think about the layout of the rooms. Since I'm in the Cellar, which might be basement level, maybe the north direction leads upwards, while east could lead to other parts of the basement. But I'm not really sure about that. Maybe I should just pick one direction
