	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Home gym. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 Alright, so I'm trying to find the Home gym starting from the Living room. The available directions are south and north. I need to decide which way to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably consider what's typically connected to a living room. In most house layouts, the living room might connect to areas like the kitchen, hallway, or maybe a bedroom. But in this case, the target is a home gym, which could be in any direction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since both south and north are options,
