	 Alright, I'm in this living room, and I need to put a broom on a shelf, a potted plant on a counter, and a plate in a wardrobe. But right now, I can see a chair, a side table, a book, and a couch. There are passages to a hallway, a bedroom, and a kitchen. Hmm, none of the items I need are here in the living room. So, I need to check out the other rooms to find these items
