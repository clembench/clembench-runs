	 ANSWER: The ▢ symbols in your grid are not arranged in a repeating pattern that includes both vertical and horizontal X's, mirroring the staggered pattern of the X's. The repeating pattern of symbols is simply ▢X▢X▢X▢, which is straightforward and does not reflect the staggered arrangement of the X's. The repeating pattern does not create a repeating sequence that mirrors the staggered X arrangement.\\ \tt \\ \tt This information reveals that the repeating pattern of symbols in your
