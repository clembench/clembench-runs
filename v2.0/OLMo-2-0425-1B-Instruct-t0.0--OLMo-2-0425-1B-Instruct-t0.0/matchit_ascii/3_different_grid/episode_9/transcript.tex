	 ANSWER: In my grid, there are no additional visual elements or features that are not part of yours. The grids are identical in terms of their composition, which consists solely of X's and ▢'s in a symmetrical 3x3 pattern. The absence of any additional symbols, shapes, or patterns in both grids suggests that the primary difference lies in the inclusion of color as a distinguishing feature.\\ \tt \\ \tt If we were to consider any potential differences\\ \tt Given the grids are identical in terms of\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
