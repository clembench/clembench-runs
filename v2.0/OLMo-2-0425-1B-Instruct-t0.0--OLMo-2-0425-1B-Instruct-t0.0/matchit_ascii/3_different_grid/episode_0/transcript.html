        <p>The triangular pattern of X&#x27;s around the edges is more pronounced in your grid.<br/><br/>ANSWER: In my grid, the triangular pattern of X&#x27;s around the edges is less pronounced. The triangular arrangement is more evident in your grid due to the precise placement of the X&#x27;s, especially in the outermost rows and columns. The triangular pattern in your grid seems more deliberate and organized, with each corner and midline of the grid featuring a distinct triangular section of X&#x27;s. In contrast, my grid&#x27;s</p>
