Given that both grids are monochromatic and consist solely of X's and ▢'s, any additional symbols or shapes\\ \tt QUESTION: Are there any additional lines, curves, or shapes that might be present in your grid but not in mine? For example, could there be any diagonal lines that cross through the grid, or curves that loop back on themselves? If you can think of such elements, please describe them. If you don't see any such elements, then the grids are indeed the same. Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else. Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.
