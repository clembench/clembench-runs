If not, what is the distribution of the X's like in relation to the central square?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: The X's in my grid are not symmetrically placed around the central square. The triangular pattern of X's is not centered around the central square but is distributed in a way that creates a unique visual effect.
