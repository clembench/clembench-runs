        <p>ANSWER: The additional detail that might not be immediately apparent from the initial description is the subtle pattern in the black and white squares. Upon closer inspection, you can see that the black squares seem to follow a diagonal pattern, starting from the top left and moving diagonally across the grid. The white squares, on the other hand, seem to follow a horizontal pattern, starting from the top and moving leftwards across the grid.<br/><br/>This pattern is not immediately obvious because the description focuses on the alternating black</p>
