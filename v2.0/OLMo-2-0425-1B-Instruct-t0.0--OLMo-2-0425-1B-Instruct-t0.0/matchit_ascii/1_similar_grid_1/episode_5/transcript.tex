	 The grid you've described is a simple 10x10 grid filled with X's, each occupying a single cell. There are no additional spaces or gaps between the X's. The arrangement is straightforward: three X's per row and column, making a total of 100 X's in a 100-square grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given this, can you describe your grid further? If you notice any additional elements or patterns that deviate from the standard X pattern, please let me know. If you're confident
