However, the additional X&#x27;s in your grid are uniformly placed symmetrically around the central square, forming a simple triangular pattern. In contrast, the additional X&#x27;s in the other grid are not uniformly distributed and appear to form a more complex pattern, possibly a triangle or cross,</p>
