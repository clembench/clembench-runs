	 ANSWER: The X's and ▢'s in the grid do not have any specific cultural or historical significance attached to them that is explicitly mentioned in the description. The symbols are purely functional, serving as placeholders for the letters X and ▢ in a grid pattern. The choice of symbols and their arrangement is arbitrary and does not carry any particular meaning beyond their role in the grid's visual representation.\\ \tt \\ \tt If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please let me know!\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
