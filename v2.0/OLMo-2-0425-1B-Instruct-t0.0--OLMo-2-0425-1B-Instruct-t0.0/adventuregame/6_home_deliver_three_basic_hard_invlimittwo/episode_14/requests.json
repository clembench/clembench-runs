Only reply with an action.\nFor example:\n> open cupboard\n\nYou can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\n\nYour goal for this game is: Put the broom on the shelf, the potted plant on the counter and the plate in the wardrobe.\n\nOnce you have achieved your goal, write \"> done\" to end the game.\n\nYou are in a living room now. There are a book, a side table, a chair and a couch. The book is on the side table. There are passages to a bedroom, a hallway and a kitchen here.\n<|assistant|>\n> put the broom on the shelf\n> put the potted plant on the counter\n> put the plate in the
