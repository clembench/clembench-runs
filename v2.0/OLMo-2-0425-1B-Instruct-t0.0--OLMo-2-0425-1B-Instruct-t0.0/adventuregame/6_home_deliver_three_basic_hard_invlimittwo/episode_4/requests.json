I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\nFor example:\n> open cupboard\n\nYou can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\n\nYour goal for this game is: Put the pillow in the refrigerator, the book in the wardrobe and the plate on the shelf.\n\nOnce you have achieved your goal, write \"> done\" to end the game.\n\nYou are in a living room now. There are a table, a side table, a couch and a chair.
