This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:30.430184", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter English word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants, making it a reasonable starting point.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:30.430651", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:30.430810", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:32.768614", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in \"house\" are marked as incorrect (red), my next guess will be a new set of letters that are commonly used in English words, trying to find at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:32.769010", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = bread\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:32.769176", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:34.838926", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"r\" and \"a\" in \"bread\" are marked as correct but in the wrong position (yellow), so my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different positions, while introducing new letters to increase the chances of finding more correct letters.\nguess: array"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:34.839299", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = rally\nguess = array\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> r<yellow> r<red> a<red> y<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:34.839455", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> r<yellow> r<red> a<red> y<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:37.610468", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"y\" in \"array\" is marked as correct (green), and \"a\" and \"r\" are still correct but in the wrong position (yellow).
