This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:09.385097", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with a common five-letter English word that contains frequently used letters, which increases the chances of getting at least one correct letter in the correct position.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:09.386064", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = party\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:09.386283", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:11.413735", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since none of the letters in the word \"house\" are correct, my next guess will be a new five-letter word that contains a completely different set of letters, trying to find at least one correct letter.\nguess: brake"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:11.414124", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = party\nguess = brake\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> k<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:11.414285", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> a<yellow> k<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:45:13.873089", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letters \"r\" and \"a\" are correct but in the wrong position, and the rest are incorrect.
