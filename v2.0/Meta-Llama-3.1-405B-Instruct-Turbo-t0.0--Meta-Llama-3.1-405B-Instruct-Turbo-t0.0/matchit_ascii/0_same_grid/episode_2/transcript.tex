	 ANSWER: Yes, the third row of my grid has an X in the first column, followed by an empty square in the second column, then an X in the third column, then an empty square in the fourth column, and finally an X in the fifth column.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
