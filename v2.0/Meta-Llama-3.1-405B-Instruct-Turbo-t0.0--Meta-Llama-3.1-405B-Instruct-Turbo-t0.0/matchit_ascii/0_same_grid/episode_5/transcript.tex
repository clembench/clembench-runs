	 ANSWER: Yes, the orientation of my grid is the same as the original grid description I provided, meaning it has not been rotated or flipped in any way.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are we correct to conclude that both our grids are indeed identical?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
