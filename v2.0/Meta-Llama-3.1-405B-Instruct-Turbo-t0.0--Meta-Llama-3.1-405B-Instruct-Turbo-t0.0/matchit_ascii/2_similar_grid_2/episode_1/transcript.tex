	 ANSWER: The two "X" symbols in the fourth row of my grid are located together in the third and fourth columns, not just in the third column, they are next to each other.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any empty rows, meaning a row with no "X" symbols at all?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
