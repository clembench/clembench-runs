Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid, with four rows of empty squares and a single \"X\" in the middle column, the last row is filled completely with \"X\" symbols."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid, containing 13 crosses (X) and 12 empty boxes. The crosses form a solid row at the bottom, a smaller grouping at the lower fourth row and single occurrences in the first two rows' third columns, with the rest being empty.\nQUESTION: Are there any \"X\" symbols in the first four rows of your grid, apart from the single \"X\" in the middle column that you mentioned?

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
