	 ANSWER: No, the X in the middle rows of my grid are positioned  third and fourth row second column to the right thus not  in the exact middle and third rows X in third column, specifically third column is accompanied by no other X in that same row is correct, there is one per the respective row each in the same column for two rows aka X  ▢ ▢ ▢  X not same row but exact location one row below into third row\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
