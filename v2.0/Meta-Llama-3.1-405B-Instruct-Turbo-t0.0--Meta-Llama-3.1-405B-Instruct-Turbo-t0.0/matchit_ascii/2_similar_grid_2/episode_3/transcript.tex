	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have these first, second or fourth positions of the third row empty, instead it has X's in all first four positions of the third row excluding the first, along with the last third row X making it have X's in all these positions for the third row.\\ \tt QUESTION: Since many of the cells of both grids had been addressed but to ensure duplicate wouldn't pass wouldn't two different picture pass as same now that we covered practically the whole grid that these\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
