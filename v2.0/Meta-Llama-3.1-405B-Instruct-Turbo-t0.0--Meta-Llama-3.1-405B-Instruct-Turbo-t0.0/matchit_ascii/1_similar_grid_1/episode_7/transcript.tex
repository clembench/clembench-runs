	 ANSWER: Yes, the single X in the top and bottom rows of my grid is positioned exactly in the middle column, which is the third column.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the positions of the X's in the second and fourth rows of your grid directly above and below each other, meaning the two X's in the second row are directly above the two X's in the fourth row?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
