	 Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below.

The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Always give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: <WORD>\\ \tt TARGETS: <TARGETS>\\ \tt \\ \tt Your team words are: screw, france, orange, turquoise, bass, brown, green, inch, storm.\\ \tt Your opponent's team words are: shorts, saxophone, zucchini, canada, drum, meter, chisel, cyclone.\\ \tt Distractor words are: tomato, hat, fog, cello, sander, norway, ireland.\\ \tt The kill words are: awl.

	 Okay, let's see. The remaining team words are screw, France, bass, inch, storm. I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being too obscure.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, screw. A screw is a type of fastener. Maybe something related to tools or hardware. But how to connect that to the other words?\\ \tt \\ \tt France. That's a country. Maybe something like "capital" but that's not directly related to the others. Or "wine" but that's not in the list. Maybe "Europe"? But France is in Europe, but others?\\ \tt \\ \tt Bass. This could be the fish or the musical instrument. If I think of music, maybe "sound" or "music". But bass is also a type of fish, so "fish" could be a clue. But how does that connect to the other words?\\ \tt \\ \tt Inch. A unit of measurement. Maybe "measure" or "length". But again, connecting to others?\\ \tt \\ \tt Storm. Weather-related. Words like "weather", "rain", "wind".\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking for a word that can connect multiple. Let's see:\\ \tt \\ \tt Screw and inch: Maybe "measurement" since screws have threads per inch? But inch is a unit. Maybe "thread" but that's part of screw. Not allowed to use parts of the words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Bass and storm: Bass as in the fish, storm could relate to sea storms? Maybe "water"? But France is a country, not directly water. Or "sea"? France has coastlines. So "sea" could link bass (fish), storm (at sea), France (coastal), but screw and inch? Hmm. Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "music" for bass (instrument) and maybe France (French music?), but screw and inch don't fit. Storm doesn't either.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "Fastener" for screw, but that's too direct. Maybe "metal"? Screw is metal, bass (fish is not), France (Eiffel Tower is metal?), but stretch.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, storm and bass (as in the instrument). Maybe "sound"? Storm makes sound, bass instrument makes sound. But France? Inch? Screw?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "storm" and "France" could relate to historical events like storms in France, but not sure. Maybe "Napoleon" but that's a stretch and not a single word.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "bass" as in low frequency sound. Storm can produce low sounds like thunder. Maybe "low"? But how does that connect to screw or inch?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "measure" for inch and screw (screws are measured in inches). Then bass (as in the fish, measured in length?), storm (measured in intensity?). France? Not sure. Maybe "unit" for inch and screw (threads per inch). But France?\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe "tool" for screw (screwdriver) and bass (a tool for music?), but that's a stretch. Storm doesn't fit.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "storm" and "France" could be linked through "Normandy" (D-Day storming), but that's a specific reference and not a single word. Maybe "battle"? Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "screw" and "storm" could be linked through "twist" (screw has threads, storm has twisting winds). But "twist" as a clue. Then bass (twist in music?), inch? Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "thread" for screw and storm (threads of a storm?), but "thread" is part of screw, which might not be allowed. The clue can't be part of the words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue has to be semantically related, not parts of the words. So "thread" is part of screw, so maybe not allowed. The user said the clue can't contain parts of the words, so maybe "twist" is okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "measure" for inch and screw (measurement). Then storm could be measured in some way. France? Maybe not. Bass (measured in length or frequency?).\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "metal" for screw (metal object), bass (strings on a bass guitar are metal?), storm (lightning is electric, not metal). France (Eiffel Tower is metal). So "metal" could link screw, France (Eiffel Tower), bass (strings). That's three. Inch and storm don't fit. But maybe that's better than nothing.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user wants to cover as many as possible. Let's see: "metal" would target screw, France (Eiffel Tower), bass (instrument strings). Three targets. Maybe that's good.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "music" for bass and France (French music?), but screw and inch don't fit. Storm? No.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "storm" and "France" could be linked through "Bastille" (storming of the Bastille), but that's a stretch. "Revolution"? Not a single word clue.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "screw" and "storm" could both relate to "pressure" (screws apply pressure, storms have low pressure systems). But how to connect to others?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "fasten" for screw, but that's too direct. Not allowed to use parts of the words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe "blue" for France (flag has blue), but blue isn't in the remaining team words. Wait, the remaining team words are screw, france, bass, inch, storm. So blue isn't there. Turquoise was already guessed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "France" could be linked to "metric" since France uses the metric system, but "inch" is imperial. So that's conflicting. Maybe "metric" as a clue, but inch is imperial. So that's a problem.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "unit" for inch and maybe screw (as in unit of measurement). France uses metric, so maybe not. But "unit" could still work for inch and screw (threads per inch). Then bass (unit of sound?), storm (unit of measurement for wind speed?). Maybe "unit" as a clue. Targets: inch, screw, storm? Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "length" for inch (unit of length) and bass (length of the instrument). Screw has length too. Storm's duration? Maybe "length" as a clue. Targets: inch, bass, screw. Three words. France and storm not included. Maybe that's better.\\ \tt \\ \tt But storm's length is duration, which is a stretch. Maybe "size" for inch, screw, bass (size of the fish or instrument). France? Not really. Storm's size? Maybe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "sound" for bass and storm (thunder). But screw and inch? Not related. France? No.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "storm" and "France" could be linked through "Paris" (storm in Paris), but that's too specific. Maybe "weather" as a clue. Targets: storm. Not enough.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "fish" for bass. But then only bass. Not helpful.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe "tool" for screw (screwdriver) and bass (a tool for music?). Not sure. Storm? No.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "sea" for bass (fish) and storm (at sea). France (coastal). So "sea" could link bass, storm, France. Three targets. Screw and inch don't fit. But that's three, which is good.\\ \tt \\ \tt So CLUE: sea. TARGETS: france, bass, storm.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, France is a country with a coastline, so "sea" makes sense. Bass as a fish in the sea. Storm at sea. That's three. Screw and inch remain. Maybe that's the best option.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "coast" for France and storm (coastal storms), bass (coastal fish). Same idea.\\ \tt \\ \tt But "sea" is a better single word. So I'll go with "sea" targeting France, bass, storm. Then the remaining words are screw and inch. Maybe next clue can target those.

France (coastal). So "sea" could link bass, storm, France. Three targets. Screw and inch don\'t fit. But that\'s three, which is good.\n\nSo CLUE: sea. TARGETS: france, bass, storm.\n\nBut wait, France is a country with a coastline, so "sea" makes sense. Bass as a fish in the sea. Storm at sea. That\'s three. Screw and inch remain. Maybe that\'s the best option.\n\nAlternatively, "coast" for France and storm (coastal storms), bass (coastal fish). Same idea.\n\nBut "sea" is a better single word. So I\'ll go with "sea" targeting France, bass, storm. Then the remaining words are screw and inch. Maybe next clue can target those. But for now, "sea" covers three, which is efficient.\nCLUE: maritime\nTARGETS: france, bass, storm', 'message': 'Your answer contained more than two lines, please only give one clue and your targets on two separate lines.'}
