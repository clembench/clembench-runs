The feedback for \"crane\" was c<red>, r<yellow>, a<red>, n<red>, e<red>. So, the only correct letter is 'r', but it's in the wrong position. The other letters c, a, n, e are not in the target word at all.\n\nHmm, I need to come up with a new guess that includes 'r' but not c, a, n, e. Also, since 'r' is yellow, it can't be in the second position again. Let's think of other common five-letter words with 'r' in a different spot. Maybe starting with a different vowel since 'a' and 'e' are out. What about 'o' or 'i'? \n\nWords like \"proxy\" have 'r' but include 'x' and 'y' which might be less common. \"Brick\" has 'r' and 'i', but 'b' and 'k' are possibilities. Wait, but the target word can't have 'c', so maybe 'b' is safe. Alternatively, \"tried\" has 'r' but includes 't' and 'd', but 'e' is already excluded. \n\nWait, the feedback says 'e' is red, so 'e' isn't in the word. So maybe \"orbit\"? 'o' as a vowel, 'r' in the second position, but 'r' was yellow in the second position before, so it can't be there. So 'r' needs to be in positions 1,3,4,5. Let's try putting 'r' in the third position. \n\nHow about \"dirty\"? 'd', 'i', 'r', 't', 'y'. But 'y' is a possible vowel. However, 'd' and 't' are new consonants. Alternatively, \"proud\" has 'r' in third position, but 'p' and 'd' are new. Wait, but 'p' wasn't in the first guess, so it's possible. \n\nAlternatively, \"robin\" has 'r' first, but 'o' and 'i' as vowels. But 'a' and 'e' are out. Wait, but 'robin' has 'b' and 'i', which are new. However, the target word might have 'r' in a different position. Let's think of another word. \n\nWhat about \"troll\"? But double letters might complicate. Alternatively, \"crisp\" but 'c' is excluded. So 'c' can't be used. Maybe \"prime\"? 'p', 'r', 'i', 'm', 'e'. But 'e' is excluded. So that's out. \n\nWait, \"prime\" has 'e' which is red, so no. What about \"prism\"? 'p', 'r', 'i', 's', 'm'. But again, 'p' is new. Let's see. Since 'r' is in the second position in \"crane\" and it's yellow, so the correct position for 'r' is not 2. So in the next guess, 'r' should be in 1,3,4,5. \n\nLet me think of a word that includes 'r' in a different position and uses other common letters. Maybe \"tiger\"? But 'e' is excluded. \"Trial\"? 't', 'r', 'i', 'a', 'l'. But 'a' is excluded. So that's out. \n\nHow about \"girly\"? 'g', 'i', 'r', 'l', 'y'. But 'y' is a possible vowel. Alternatively, \"drink\"? But 'd', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'k'. But 'n' is excluded. So 'n' can't be in the word. \n\nWait, the feedback said 'n' is red, so 'n' isn't in the target. So \"drink\" is out. Hmm. Let's try \"brisk\". 'b', 'r', 'i', 's', 'k'. 'b', 'r', 'i', 's', 'k' â€“ none of these were in the excluded letters except 'r' which is yellow. So 'b', 'i', 's', 'k' are new. That could work. \n\nAlternatively, \"bring\" but 'n' is excluded. So no. \"Frost\"? 'f', 'r', 'o', 's', 't'. 'f' and 'o' are new. 'r' in second position again, but since it's yellow there, maybe it's in another position. Wait, but in \"frost\", 'r' is in second position. Since 'r' was yellow in position 2, that means the correct position is not 2, so \"frost\" would have 'r' in the wrong spot again. So maybe avoid that. \n\nWhat about \"proud\"? 'p', 'r', 'o', 'u', 'd'. 'r' is in third position here. That's different from the previous guess. 'p', 'o', 'u', 'd' are new letters. Maybe that's a good option. \n\nAlternatively, \"route\"? 'r' in first position. But 'e' is excluded. So 'route' is out. \"Rusty\"? 'r' first, 'u', 's', 't', 'y'. That could work. 'r' in position 1, which is a new position. \n\nBut I need to choose a word that includes 'r' in a different position and uses other common letters not excluded. Let's think of \"burst\". 'b', 'u', 'r', 's', 't'. 'r' in third position. But 't' is new. \n\nAlternatively, \"crisp\" but 'c' is excluded. So no. \"Trope\"? 't', 'r', 'o', 'p', 'e'. 'e' is excluded. \n\nHmm. Maybe \"brick\"? 'b', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'k'. But 'c' is excluded. So no. \n\nWait, \"brink\" has 'n' which is excluded. So no. \n\nWhat about \"dairy\"? 'd', 'a' is excluded. So no. \n\n\"Tried\"? 'e' is excluded. \n\n\"Pried\"? 'e' excluded. \n\n\"Grown\"? 'n' excluded. \n\nHmm. Maybe \"pilot\"? But no 'r'. \n\nWait, the key is to include 'r' but not c, a, n, e. Let's list possible letters. Vowels left could be i, o, u. \n\nSo maybe \"proud\" as a guess. 'p', 'r', 'o', 'u', 'd'. All new letters except 'r', which is in position 3 now. That way, if 'r' is in position 3, it would be green. If not, maybe it's in another position. \n\nAlternatively, \"spurt\"? 's', 'p', 'u', 'r', 't'. 'r' in position 4. \n\nBut maybe \"proud\" is better. Let's go with \"proud\" as the next guess. It includes 'r' in a new position and uses other common letters.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "eos"}], "created": 1740564156, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1637, "prompt_tokens": 327, "total_tokens": 1964}, "provider": "Together", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 10:02:36.572390", "call_duration": "0:00:39.060010", "response": "explanation: The feedback shows 'r' is present but not in position 2.

The previous guess was \"proud\" and the feedback had some clues. The 'u' is green in position 4, so that's definitely correct. The 'r' and 'o' are yellow, meaning they're in the word but not in positions 2 and 3. Also, 'p' and 'd' are red, so they can be excluded.\n\nSo the target word has 'u' in the fourth spot. The letters 'r' and 'o' are somewhere else. From the first guess \"crane\", we know 'c', 'a', 'n', 'e' are out. Now 'p' and 'd' are also out. So remaining letters to consider are 'r', 'o', and maybe other vowels or consonants not yet tested.\n\nWe need a five-letter word with 'u' in position 4. Let's think of possible letters. The first letter can't be c, p, or d. The second letter can't be r (since it was yellow in position 2). The third letter can't be o (yellow in position 3). The fifth letter can't be e, d, or n.\n\nPossible letters for the first position: maybe 'b', 'f', 'g', 'h', etc. Let's think of words with 'u' in the fourth position. Words like \"blurb\" (but 'b' is possible, but 'b' hasn't been tested yet). Or \"flour\" â€“ but 'f' is new, 'l' hasn't been excluded. Wait, \"flour\" has 'u' in position 4. Let's check the letters. 'f', 'l', 'o', 'u', 'r'. But 'o' is yellow, so it should be in the word but not in position 3. If \"flour\" has 'o' in position 3, that's where it was yellow, so that's not allowed. So 'o' needs to be in another position. Maybe position 1 or 5? But position 5 can't be 'r' because in the first guess, 'r' was in position 2 and was yellow. Wait, in the first feedback, 'r' was yellow in position 2, so 'r' is in the word but not in position 2. In the second guess, 'r' was in position 2 again and still yellow, which might mean that 'r' is in the word but not in position 2. So 'r' could be in positions 1,3,4,5. But position 4 is 'u' now. So 'r' could be in 1,3,5.\n\nWait, the second guess was \"proud\": p<red> r<yellow> o<yellow> u<green> d<red>. So 'r' is yellow in position 2, so 'r' is in the word but not in position 2. 'o' is yellow in position 3, so 'o' is in the word but not in position 3. 'u' is green in position 4. So the word has 'u' in position 4, 'r' somewhere else (positions 1,3,5), and 'o' somewhere else (positions 1,2,4,5). But position 4 is already 'u', so 'o' can be in 1,2,5.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits these constraints. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider 'u' in position 4. Possible words: \"group\" (but 'g' is new, 'p' is red, so no). \"Trouble\" is too long. \"Crout\" â€“ but 'c' is red. \"Bourn\" â€“ 'n' is red. \"Yourn\" â€“ not a word. \"Flour\" â€“ as before, but 'o' in position 3 is yellow, so can't be there. So 'o' needs to be in another position. What about \"roust\"? But 's' and 't' are new. Let's see: r in position 1, o in position 2 (but in the second guess, 'o' was in position 3 and was yellow, so o can't be in position 3. If we put o in position 2, that's allowed. So \"roust\" would have 'r' in 1, 'o' in 2, 'u' in 4. But does that fit the feedback? Let's check. The first guess had 'r' in position 2 (yellow), so 'r' can't be there. If \"roust\" has 'r' in 1, that's okay. Then 'o' in 2, which hasn't been tested yet. But in the second guess, 'o' was in position 3 and was yellow, so 'o' can't be in 3. So 'o' could be in 2. Then 'u' in 4. The letters 's' and 't' are new. But we don't know if they're in the word. Alternatively, maybe \"broth\" â€“ but 'b' is new, 'o' in position 3 is invalid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"houri\" â€“ but that's a less common word. \"Court\" â€“ 'c' is red. \"Gourd\" â€“ 'g' is new, 'd' is red. \"Mourn\" â€“ 'm' is new, 'n' is red. \"Fourm\" â€“ not a word. \"Lours\" â€“ 'l' is new, 's' is new. \"Fours\" â€“ 'f' is new, 's' is new. \"Hourl\" â€“ no. \"Dour\" is too short. \"Rouge\" â€“ 'e' is red. \"Roupy\" â€“ maybe, but 'y' is new. \"Roues\" â€“ 'e' is red. \"Rouen\" â€“ 'n' is red. \"Roups\" â€“ 'p' is red. \"Roust\" â€“ as before. Let's check \"roust\": r (position 1, which is allowed), o (position 2, which is allowed since 'o' was yellow in position 3), u (position 4, green), s (new), t (new). The problem is that we don't know if 's' and 't' are in the word. But maybe that's a good guess to test new letters. Alternatively, maybe \"broom\" â€“ but 'b' is new, 'm' is new, and 'o' in position 3 is invalid. Hmm.\n\nWait, the letters we know are in the word are 'r', 'o', 'u'. So the target word has those three letters plus two others. The excluded letters are c, a, n, e, p, d. So possible letters left are b, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, q, s, t, v, w, x, y, z. So maybe try a word that includes 'r', 'o', 'u' and two new letters. For example, \"rotus\" â€“ but 't' and 's' are new. \"Turbo\" â€“ but 'b' and 't' are new, and 'o' in position 5. Let's see: turbo has 't' in 1, 'u' in 2 (but 'u' is supposed to be in 4), so no. \"Roupy\" â€“ 'y' is new. \"Rouge\" â€“ 'e' is excluded. \"Roufs\" â€“ 'f' is new. \"Rougy\" â€“ not a word. \"Roums\" â€“ no. \"Rouks\" â€“ maybe. \"Roups\" â€“ 'p' is excluded. Hmm. Maybe \"torus\" â€“ 't' in 1, 'o' in 2, 'r' in 3, '"}}], "created": 1740564195, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1707, "prompt_tokens": 479, "total_tokens": 2186}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 10:03:15.633388", "call_duration": "0:06:02.934735", "response": "", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
