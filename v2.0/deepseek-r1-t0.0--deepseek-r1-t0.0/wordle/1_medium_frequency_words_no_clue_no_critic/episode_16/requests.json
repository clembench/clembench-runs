But wait, the feedback didn't mention l or d, so they could still be possible. Alternatively, \"stain\" has an \"a\" but includes \"n\" which was marked red. No, can't use \"n\". \n\nWait, the feedback said n is red, so \"stain\" is out. What about \"salsa\"? But \"s\" might be a good starting letter. However, \"salsa\" has two s's and two a's. Maybe \"shade\"? But \"e\" is red. So \"shade\" is out. \n\nAlternatively, \"plate\"? But \"p\" is new, \"l\", \"a\" (but a is yellow, so needs to be in a different position), \"t\", \"e\" which is red. So \"plate\" might not work. \n\nWait, maybe \"blast\"? But \"b\" is new, \"l\", \"a\" (needs to be not in third position), \"s\", \"t\". But \"a\" is in the third position here, which was the original position in \"crane\" where it was yellow.

S-A-L-T-Y. That uses \"a\" in the second position, which is different from the third in \"crane\". Also, s, l, t, y are new letters. This could help test those letters.

The previous guess was \"salty\" and the feedback shows that S and Y are red, so they're not in the target word.

Now, in \"salty\", A was in position 2, L in 3, T in 4. Since those are all yellow, they need to be moved.\n\nPossible positions: A can't be in 2, L can't be in 3, T can't be in 4. Let's think of words with A, L, T. Maybe \"latte\"? But T was already in position 4 and it's yellow, so T can't be there. Wait, but \"latte\" has T in position 4 and 5. Hmm, but the feedback for \"salty\" had T as yellow in position 4, so T is in the word but not there. So maybe T is in another position. Let's think of other letters. Since S and Y are out, and we need to include A, L, T. Also, from the first guess, C, R, N, E are out. So remaining letters could be... maybe vowels like O or I? Wait, but we have A already. Let's see. Maybe \"tidal\"? But D wasn't tested yet. Or \"altar\"? But R is out. Hmm. Wait, \"talon\"? But O and N are possible? Wait, N was in the first guess and was red, so N is out. So \"talon\" is out. What about \"aloft\"? But F hasn't been tested. Maybe \"plate\"? But P and E are out (E was red in first guess). Wait, \"bloat\"? B is a new letter. Let's check letters that haven't been excluded. From previous guesses, excluded letters are C, R, N, E, S, Y. So possible letters include A, L, T, plus others like B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z. But need a 5-letter word with A, L, T. Let's think of \"latte\" again. But T is in position 4 and 5. Wait, but in \"salty\", T was in position 4 and yellow, so T must be elsewhere. So maybe T is in position 1 or 2 or 3 or 5. But in \"salty\", A was in position 2 (yellow), so A can't be there. Let's try moving A to position 1. So A in 1, then L and T in other positions. For example, \"alert\". But E is excluded. \"altar\" has R excluded. \"album\" has B and M, but missing T. \"adult\"? D and U are new letters, but A is in position 1. Wait, \"adult\" has A in 1, D, U, L, T. But D and U haven't been tested. Maybe \"tally\"? But Y is excluded. \"atlas\"? S is excluded. Hmm. Maybe \"latch\"? C is excluded. \"fault\"? F is new. \"halts\"? S is excluded. \"malt\"? Too short. \"malta\"? But it's a proper noun. Maybe \"talon\" again, but N is excluded. Wait, maybe \"tulip\"? But that has U, I, P. Not sure. Alternatively, \"plate\" but E is out. Wait, maybe \"latte\" is possible. Let's check: L in position 1, A in 2 (but A was yellow in position 2 in \"salty\", so can't be there). So \"latte\" would have A in 2, which is invalid. So maybe \"tally\" but Y is out. Hmm. Maybe \"aloft\" with A in 1, L in 2, O in 3, F in 4, T in 5. But O and F are new. Alternatively, \"blast\" but S is out. Wait, maybe \"balta\"? Not a word. Alternatively, \"flatt\" but double T and F. Not sure. Maybe \"tidal\"? T in 1, I in 2, D in 3, A in 4, L in 5. That way, A is moved from position 2 to 4, L from 3 to 5, T from 4 to 1. That could work. Let's check: T in 1 (new position), I is new, D is new, A in 4 (not previously there), L in 5. So \"tidal\" would test T in position 1, I and D as new letters. But maybe that's a good next guess. Alternatively, \"adult\" as mentioned before. Or \"delta\" but E is excluded. Hmm. Alternatively, \"latte\" but E is excluded. Wait, \"tidal\" seems possible. Let's go with \"tidal\" as the next guess. It includes A, L, T in new positions and introduces D and I. If any of those letters are correct, we'll get more feedback. Alternatively, maybe \"altit\" isn't a word. Alternatively, \"tibia\" but that's not right. Hmm. Alternatively, \"tabla\"? B is new. \"tabla\" has T in 1, A in 2 (but A can't be in 2), so that's invalid. Maybe \"alibi\"? But I and B. Not sure. Alternatively, \"latin\" but N is excluded. Hmm.

The previous guess was \"tidal\" and the feedback was t<green>, i<red>, d<red>, a<green>, l<green>. So, the correct letters in the right positions are T in position 1, A in position 4, and L in position 5. That means the word starts with T, ends with L, and has an A in the fourth spot. The letters I and D are not in the word at all.\n\nFrom the previous feedbacks, we know that A was previously yellow in position 3 and 2, but now it's green in position 4, so that's fixed. The letters S, Y, C, R, N, E, I, D are all excluded now. \n\nSo the current known structure is T _ _ A L. We need to find the missing letters in positions 2 and 3. The letters that are already tried and excluded are S, Y, C, R, N, E, I, D. So possible letters could be from the remaining consonants and vowels. Let's think about common letters that haven't been used yet. Maybe B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. Also, vowels left could be O, U.\n\nWait, but in the second guess \"salty\", the feedback had A, L, T as yellow. Now T is green in position 1, L is green in 5, and A in 4. So the previous yellows for L and T are now correctly placed. The A was moved from position 2 to 4, which is now correct. So the remaining letters to find are positions 2 and 3. \n\nIn the third guess \"tidal\", the letters I and D were incorrect, so those can be excluded. So possible letters for positions 2 and 3 are letters not in S, Y, C, R, N, E, I, D. Let's think of common letters. Maybe M, O, P, U, B, G, etc. \n\nLooking for a word that fits T _ _ A L. Let's think of possible words. For example, \"total\" but T is already in position 1, and A is in 4. Wait, \"total\" would be T O T A L, but that would have O in position 2 and T in 3. But T is already in position 1, so duplicate T might be possible. But in the feedback from \"tidal\", T is green in position 1, so the target word has T there. If the target word had another T, like in \"total\", but the third letter would be T. But in the first guess \"crane\", the feedback had A as yellow, so maybe the target word has only one A, which is now in position 4. Wait, \"total\" has A in position 4 and L in 5, which matches. But does \"total\" have any letters that were excluded? Let's check: O is not excluded yet. So maybe \"total\" is a possibility. But wait, in the third guess \"tidal\", the letter D is excluded, so \"total\" doesn't have D. But let's check if \"total\" fits the feedback. However, in the second guess \"salty\", the feedback had T as yellow in position 4, but now T is green in position 1. So \"total\" would have T in position 1 and 3, but the feedback from \"salty\" had T as yellow in position 4. Wait, maybe that's conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"trial\" but R was excluded in the first feedback. So R is out. \"Tonal\"? But N is excluded. \"Tubal\"? U is allowed, B is allowed. \"Tubal\" would be T U B A L. Let's check if U and B are allowed. From previous guesses, U hasn't been tried yet. B hasn't been excluded. So \"tubal\" could be a candidate. Another option is \"tulip\" but ends with P, which is not L. Wait, no, the word must end with L. So \"tubal\" fits T _ _ A L. Let's see if that's a valid word. Yes, \"tubal\" is a word relating to tubes. \n\nAlternatively, \"tidal\" was already guessed, but D is excluded. So \"tubal\" might be a good guess. Let's check the letters. T (green), U (new), B (new), A (green), L (green). So U and B are new letters not previously tried. This would test those letters. If the feedback comes back with U or B as yellow or green, that helps. Alternatively, maybe \"towel\" but W is allowed, but the structure is T _ _ A L, so the fourth letter must be A. So \"towel\" is T O W E L, but E is excluded. So no. \n\nAnother possibility: \"tacit\" but ends with T, not L. \"Tally\" but Y is excluded. \"Talus\" but S is excluded. \"Tamil\" but M is allowed. \"Tamil\" is a valid word. Let's check: T A M I L. But A is in position 2 here, but in the target word, A is in position 4. So that's not matching. \n\nWait, the structure is T _ _ A L. So positions 2 and 3 need to be filled. Let's think of possible combinations. Letters not excluded: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. So possible letters. Let's think of common letters. Maybe O and M. So \"tom\" in positions 2-3: T O M A L. \"Tomal\" isn't a word. \"Tomal\" might not be valid. \"Tomal\" isn't in the dictionary. How about \"tonal\"? But N is excluded. \"Topal\"? Not a word. \"Tofal\"? Unlikely. \"Tubal\" seems more plausible. \n\nAlternatively, \"trawl\" but W is allowed, but structure is T _ _ A L. So T W R A L? But R is excluded. So no. \n\nAnother angle: in the second guess \"salty\", the letters S, A, L, T, Y. Feedback had A, L, T as yellow. Now, in the third guess \"tidal\", T is green in 1, A in 4, L in 5. So the previous yellows for T and L are now correctly placed. The A was moved from position 2 to 4. So the remaining letters to find are positions 2 and 3, which must be letters that were not in the excluded list. \n\nWait, in the first guess \"crane\", the feedback had A as yellow. Then in \"salty\", A was yellow in position 2. Then in \"tidal\", A is green in position 4. So the A was correctly placed in position 4. So the target word has A in position 4. \n\nSo the structure is T _ _ A L. Let's think of possible words. \"Tubal\" is T U B A L. Another option: \"tupal\" but not a word. \"Tufal\"? No. \"Tubal\" is valid. \"Tubal\" is a medical term. Another possibility: \"tweak\" but ends with K. No. \"Tweak\" is five letters but doesn't fit the structure. \n\nAlternatively, \"trial\" but R is excluded. \"Trawl\" as before. \"Tubal\" seems like the best bet. Let's check if there are other possibilities. \"Tidal\" was already guessed, but D is excluded. \"Tubal\" uses U and B, which are new. Let's go with \"tubal\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740587243, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1771, "prompt_tokens": 512, "total_tokens": 2283}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 16:27:23.185471", "call_duration": "0:03:26.700021", "response": "explanation: T, A, L are confirmed in positions 1, 4, 5.
