Wait, \"crone\" is a valid word. Let me check if there are others. \"Crane\" had A, which is out. \"Crime\" would have I, but M isn't in the feedback. Wait, the feedback shows that C, R, N, E are correct, so the third letter is the only unknown. So possible words: crone, crine (invalid), cruve (no), creme (but M wasn't in the first guess). Hmm. \"Crone\" seems plausible. Let me confirm. The letters C, R, O, N, E. Since A is excluded, O is a good candidate.
