The first guess was \"crane\" and the feedback is c<red>, r<yellow>, a<red>, n<red>, e<yellow>. So, the letters C, A, N are not in the target word at all. R and E are present but in different positions.\n\nSo, the target word has R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5. Also, since A is red, the word doesn't have an A. That eliminates a lot of common vowels. Maybe the vowels are E, O, I, U, or Y. But E is already confirmed, though it's yellow, so it's in the word but not at the end.\n\nNow, I need to think of a five-letter word that includes R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5. Also, avoiding C, A, N. Let's consider possible positions for R and E. Since R was in position 2 and is yellow, R must be in 1,3,4, or 5. But position 5 was E in the first guess, which is yellow, so E can't be there. So E is in 1-4.\n\nPossible words... Let's try to use other common letters. Maybe \"tries\"? But S might not be in there. Or \"bribe\"? But B might not be known. Wait, but we don't have info on other consonants yet. Alternatively, \"reply\" has R and E. Let's check: R is in position 2 (original guess had R there, which was yellow). So in \"reply\", R is in position 2 again, which would still be yellow. But the feedback said R is yellow, so it's not in position 2. So \"reply\" would have R in 2 again, which is wrong. So maybe \"riper\"? But that has R in position 1 and 4. But the target word might have R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. Also, E is in position 5 here, but E was yellow in position 5, so E can't be there. So \"riper\" would have E in position 4. Wait, but the original E was in position 5, which was yellow, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in 1-4.\n\nAnother option: \"store\". But S isn't ruled out. However, \"store\" has E in position 5, which is invalid. So not that. \"Rider\"? R in position 1 and 3. But D isn't known. \"Bread\"? B, R, E, A (but A is excluded). So no. \"Tiger\"? T is possible, I is a vowel. T, I, G, E, R. But A is excluded. Let's see: T in position 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5. But E was yellow in position 5, so E can't be there. Wait, in \"tiger\", E is in position 4. So that's okay. R is in position 5. But in the feedback, R was in position 2 (yellow), so R can't be there. So in \"tiger\", R is in position 5. If the target word has R in 5, then in the first guess, R was in position 2, which would be red if R is actually in 5. Wait, no. The feedback for R was yellow, meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in 1,3,4,5. So \"tiger\" has R in 5. So that's possible. But E is in position 4 here. The original E was in position 5 (yellow), so E is in the word but not in 5. So \"tiger\" has E in 4, which is okay. But does that fit? Let's check the letters: T, I, G, E, R. C, A, N are excluded. So possible. But maybe there's a better word. Alternatively, \"trove\"? T, R, O, V, E. R in position 2 again, which was yellow. So R can't be in 2. So \"trove\" would have R in 2, which is invalid. So no. \"Ridge\"? R in 1, I, D, G, E. E in 5, which is invalid. So E can't be there. So \"ridge\" is out. \"Bride\"? B, R, I, D, E. E in 5 again. No. \"Prime\"? P, R, I, M, E. E in 5. No. \"Pride\"? Same issue. \"Ripe\"? Too short. \"Riser\"? R in 1, I, S, E, R. E in 4. But S is unknown. Maybe. But \"riser\" has R in 1 and 5. But the target word has R once, unless it's duplicated. But the feedback for \"crane\" had R as yellow, so at least one R. But maybe two? Unlikely, but possible. However, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates. So maybe \"riser\" is possible. But S is not ruled out. Alternatively, \"tiler\"? T, I, L, E, R. E in 4, R in 5. That works. T, I, L, E, R. Letters not excluded. So \"tiler\" could be a guess. But maybe a more common word. Alternatively, \"tiger\" as before. Let's think of other possibilities. \"Borer\"? B, O, R, E, R. But O is possible. But B is not ruled out. \"Lover\"? L, O, V, E, R. E in 4, R in 5. That's possible. But L, O, V are not excluded. But maybe starting with a word that includes R and E in different positions. Alternatively, \"reply\" again, but R is in 2 which was yellow, so can't be there. So \"reply\" is invalid. Hmm. Maybe \"perky\"? P, E, R, K, Y. E in 2, R in 3. But E was in position 5 in the first guess, which was yellow, so E is not in 5. But in \"perky\", E is in 2. That's allowed. So E is in the word but not in 5. So \"perky\" could work. But K and Y are less common. Maybe \"pearl\"? But A is excluded. So no. \"Pried\"? P, R, I, E, D. E in 4. That's possible. But D is unknown. \"Tried\"? T, R, I, E, D. Same as above. \"Tribe\"? T, R, I, B, E. E in 5, which is invalid. So no. \"Ripe\" is four letters. \"Riles\"? R in 1, I, L, E, S. E in 4. That's possible. But S is unknown. \"Riled\"? Same structure. \"Rider\"? R in 1 and 3. But D is unknown. \"Riser\" again. Maybe \"tiger\" is better. Let's check: T is a common consonant, I is a vowel. G is possible. So \"tiger\" includes R and E, with E in position 4 and R in 5. That would mean in the first guess, R was in position 2 (yellow), so in the target word, R is in 5. Then, in \"tiger\", R is in 5, which would be green. But the feedback for the first guess had R as yellow, so R is not in 2. If the target word has R in 5, then in the first guess, R was in 2, which would be yellow. So that's possible. Also, E in \"tiger\" is in position 4. In the first guess, E was in position 5 (yellow), so E is in the word but not in 5. So \"tiger\" fits. Also, \"tiger\" doesn't contain C, A, N. So this could be a good guess. Let's go with \"tiger\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740586315, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1885, "prompt_tokens": 306, "total_tokens": 2191}, "provider": "Kluster", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 16:11:55.421044", "call_duration": "0:01:30.346418", "response": "explanation: letters C, A, N are excluded.

So, the correct letters in the right positions are I in the second spot, E in the fourth, and R in the fifth. The V is present but in the wrong position. Also, L is excluded.\n\nSo the target word is _ I _ E R. The V is somewhere else, not in the third position. Let's think about possible letters. We know C, A, N, T, G, L are excluded. From previous guesses, we have R, E, I confirmed. The V is yellow, so it must be in either the first or third position. But the first letter can't be L (red), so maybe V is in the first position? Wait, but V is yellow in \"liver\", which was in the third position, so V is not there. So V must be in the first position. But wait, the first letter in \"liver\" was L, which is red, so V is not in the first position either. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the feedback for \"liver\" was V as yellow in the third position. So V is in the word but not in the third position. So possible positions for V are first, fourth, or fifth. But fourth and fifth are already E and R, so V must be in the first position. But the first letter can't be L (from \"liver\"), but V wasn't excluded yet. So maybe the first letter is V. Let's check: V _ _ E R. But we need a letter in the third position. The known letters are I in second, E in fourth, R in fifth. The third letter is unknown. Also, V is in the first position. So the word would be V I _ E R. The third letter can't be any of the excluded letters (C, A, N, T, G, L). Possible letters could be B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z. Let's think of common letters. Maybe S? So \"V I S E R\"? But \"viser\" is a word. Or \"V I B E R\"? \"Viber\"? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first letter isn't V. Wait, but V has to be somewhere. Let's think again. The feedback for \"tiger\" had T and G as red, so those are excluded. In \"liver\", L is red, so excluded. So possible letters left include B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. The V is present but not in third position. So possible positions: first, second (but second is I), third (but that's where V was in \"liver\" and it was yellow, so no), fourth (E), fifth (R). So V must be in first position. So the word is V I _ E R. The third letter needs to be a consonant not excluded. Let's try common letters. Maybe S? \"Viser\" is a valid word. Or \"Viper\"? Wait, \"viper\" is a word. Let's check: V I P E R. But P was not excluded yet. In the first guess \"crane\", P wasn't used. In \"tiger\", P wasn't tested. So \"viper\" would have V in first, I in second, P in third, E in fourth, R in fifth. That fits. But wait, in the first guess \"crane\", the feedback had E as yellow, so E was not in fifth position, which in \"viper\" it's in fourth, which is correct. Let's check if \"viper\" is a possible answer. The letters excluded so far are C, A, N, T, G, L. V is allowed. So \"viper\" would be a valid guess. Alternatively, \"viver\" but V is in first and third, but that's not possible. Wait, \"viver\" has V in first and third, but in \"liver\", V was in third and was yellow, so V can't be in third. So \"viper\" seems possible.
