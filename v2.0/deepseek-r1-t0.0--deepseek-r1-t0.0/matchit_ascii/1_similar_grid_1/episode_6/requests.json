The user mentioned it's a 5x5 grid. Let me visualize it again. The grid is:\n\nFirst row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢  \nSecond row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢  \nThird row: X X X X X  \nFourth row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢  \nFifth row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢  \n\nHmm, so the center row is all X's. Then, moving outwards from the center, each row has fewer X's. Let me check the symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same: two empty, then an X, then two empty. The second and fourth rows are also the same: one empty, two X's, then two empty. The middle row is all X's. So it's symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. The pattern looks like a diamond or a rhombus shape. The X's form a diamond in the center. Let me count the X's. First row: 1, second: 2, third:5, fourth:2, fifth:1. Total of 11 X's. The positions are centered in the middle column. So maybe the description should mention the diamond shape, symmetry, and the number of X's in each row. Alternatively, specify the exact positions. For example, rows 1 and 5 have an X in the third column. Rows 2 and 4 have X's in columns 2 and 3. The middle row is all X's. So the description needs to be concise but accurate. Let me make sure I don't miss any details. Each row's X positions:\n\nRow 1: Column 3  \nRow 2: Columns 2 and 3  \nRow 3: All columns  \nRow 4: Columns 2 and 3  \nRow 5: Column 3  \n\nYes, that's correct. So the description should highlight the diamond pattern, symmetry, and the specific columns where X's are located. Maybe start by stating it's a symmetrical 5x5 grid with a diamond pattern formed by X's. Then mention each row's X positions. Alternatively, just list the positions row by row. Since the user wants a short description, perhaps the key points are symmetry and the diamond shape. Let me check if there's another way to describe it. The X's form a vertical line in the center column (column 3) with adjacent columns filled in the middle rows. So rows 1 and 5 have only the center X, rows 2 and 4 have center and one to the left, and row 3 has all. Wait, no. Wait, row 2 and 4 have columns 2 and 3 as X's. So in row 2, columns 2 and 3 are X, and the rest are empty. So the diamond expands from the center. So the description could be: a diamond-shaped pattern centered in a 5x5 grid, with the middle row fully filled, the rows above and below having two X's each, and the top and bottom rows having one X in the center. That's probably a good way to put it. Alternatively, more precise: \"A 5x5 grid with X's forming a diamond: the third row is all X's; the second and fourth rows have X's in columns 2-3; the first and fifth rows have an X in column 3.\" That's concise and captures the structure.

So, the grid is a 5x5 grid, right? Let me visualize it again. The first two rows have two empty squares, then an X, then two more empty squares. Wait, no, looking at the given grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: ▢ X X X ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo, rows 1 and 2 have an X in the third column. Then row 3 is all X's. Row 4 has X's in columns 2, 3, 4. Row 5 is like rows 1 and 2 again. Hmm. So the middle row is completely filled. Then, the rows above and below the middle have a single X in the center, but wait, no. Wait, rows 1 and 2 have X in the third position (center), but rows 4 and 5? Wait, row 4 has X's in positions 2,3,4. So maybe the grid forms a diamond shape? Let me check.\n\nRow 1: Center (3rd) is X, others empty.\nRow 2: Same as row 1.\nRow 3: All X's.\nRow 4: X's in columns 2,3,4.\nRow 5: Same as rows 1 and 2.\n\nWait, that would make a sort of diamond. The middle row is full, the rows adjacent to the middle (rows 2 and 4) have three X's in the middle, and the top and bottom rows have a single X in the center. Wait, no. Wait, row 4 has three X's (columns 2-4), and row 2 has only one X in column 3. Wait, no, row 2 is the same as row 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. So rows 1 and 2 each have a single X in the center. Then row 3 is all X's, row 4 has three X's (positions 2,3,4), and row 5 again a single X in the center. So when you look at it, the X's form a sort of diamond or hourglass shape. The middle row is a full line, then above and below that, the X's spread out. Wait, but row 4 has three X's, which is one less than the full row. Then rows 1,2,5 have a single X. So maybe the shape is like a vertical line in the center, with the middle row expanded. Alternatively, maybe it's a cross? Wait, a cross would have a horizontal line through the middle and a vertical line. But here, the middle row is horizontal, and the vertical line is only in the center column. Let me count the positions:\n\nRow 1: Column 3 is X.\nRow 2: Column 3 is X.\nRow 3: All columns (1-5) are X.\nRow 4: Columns 2,3,4 are X.\nRow 5: Column 3 is X.\n\nSo vertically, column 3 has X's in all rows except maybe row 4? Wait, no. Column 3 in row 4 is X. So column 3 has X's in all rows. Wait, rows 1,2,3,4,5 all have X in column 3. So that's a vertical line down the middle. Then, row 3 is a horizontal line across. So combining a vertical line (column 3) and a horizontal line (row 3), forming a plus sign. But then, in row 4, columns 2,3,4 are X. Wait, but row 3 is all X's. So maybe the grid is a combination of a plus sign and some additional X's. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIf column 3 is all X's (since every row has X in column 3), and row 3 is all X's, then the intersection is the center cell (3,3). So that's a plus sign. But in row 4, columns 2,3,4 are X. So that's adding two more X's in row 4 (columns 2 and 4). Similarly, row 2 has only column 3. Wait, no, row 2 is same as row 1: only column 3. So the vertical line is column 3 (all rows), horizontal line is row 3 (all columns). Then, in row 4, there are X's in columns 2,3,4. So that's three X's in row 4. Similarly, row 2 has only column 3. So maybe the shape is a vertical line with a horizontal line in the middle, and then in the row below the middle (row 4), there's a horizontal line of three X's. But that seems a bit inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe it's a diamond shape where the middle is the full row, and then each row above and below tapers. Let me see:\n\nRow 3 (middle): 5 X's.\n\nRow 2 and 4: 3 X's each? Wait, row 2 has only 1 X. Wait, no. Wait, row 4 has 3 X's (columns 2-4). Row 2 has 1 X (column 3). So maybe it's not symmetric. Hmm. Wait, maybe the grid is a vertical line (column 3) with a horizontal line in the middle (row 3), and then in row 4, there's a horizontal line of three X's, but that's overlapping with the vertical line. So the total X's would be:\n\nColumn 3: 5 X's (all rows).\n\nRow 3: 5 X's (all columns).\n\nRow 4: columns 2,3,4 (but column 3 is already counted in the vertical line).\n\nSo the total X's would be 5 (vertical) + 5 (horizontal) - 1 (overlap at center) + 2 (row 4 columns 2 and 4) = 11? Wait, but let's count the actual grid:\n\nRow 1: 1 X\n\nRow 2: 1 X\n\nRow 3: 5 X's\n\nRow 4: 3 X's\n\nRow 5: 1 X\n\nTotal: 1+1+5+3+1=11 X's.\n\nYes. So the grid has 11 X's. The vertical line in column 3 (5 X's), the horizontal line in row 3 (5 X's), but overlapping at (3,3), so total 5+5-1=9, but then row 4 has two more X's in columns 2 and 4. Wait, no. Wait, row 4 has X's in columns 2,3,4. But column 3 is already part of the vertical line, so that's adding two more X's (columns 2 and 4). Similarly, row 2 has only column 3, which is part of the vertical line. So total X's: 5 (vertical) + 5 (horizontal) -1 (overlap) + 2 (row 4 columns 2 and 4) = 11. That matches the count.\n\nSo the description should mention the vertical line down the center column (column 3), the horizontal line across the middle row (row 3), and three additional X's in row 4 (columns 2,3,4). Wait, but row 4's X's include column 3, which is already part of the vertical line. So maybe the description should be: a vertical line in the center column, a horizontal line in the middle row, and in the fourth row, X's extending to the left and right of the center. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to describe the shape as a cross (plus sign) with an additional horizontal line segment in row 4, spanning columns 2-4. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is a vertical line in column 3, a horizontal line in row 3, and then in row 4, there's a horizontal line of three X's centered, which would be columns 2-4. So combining all that, the grid has a cross (plus) and an extra horizontal line segment below the center. But I need to describe this clearly and concisely.\n\nAnother approach: The grid is symmetric vertically (since columns 1 and 5 are the same, 2 and 4 are the same). Let's check:\n\nRow 1: columns 1 and 5 are empty, 2 and 4 empty, 3 X.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: all X.\n\nRow 4: columns 1 and 5 empty, 2,3,4 X.\n\nRow 5: same as rows 1 and 2.\n\nSo yes, symmetric about the vertical axis (column 3). So the description can mention vertical symmetry.\n\nSo putting it all together, the grid has:\n\n- A vertical line of X's in the center column (column 3) from top to bottom.\n\n- A horizontal line of X's in the middle row (row 3) spanning all columns.\n\n- In the fourth row, X's in columns 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAlternatively, since row 4's X's are columns 2-4, which is symmetric around column 3. So maybe the description could be:\n\nA vertical line through the center column, a horizontal line through the middle row, and in the fourth row, a horizontal line of three X's centered on column 3.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to structure it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, considering the shape, it's like a cross (plus) with an extra horizontal line segment below the center. But I need to make sure the description is clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a diamond shape. Let's see: the middle row is full. The rows above and below have decreasing numbers of X's. But in this case, row 4 has three X's, which is more than row 2 (which has one). So maybe not a diamond. Alternatively, it's a cross with an extra part.\n\nWait, maybe the best way is to list the positions:\n\n- Column 3 has X's in all rows (rows 1-5).\n\n- Row 3 has X's in all columns (columns 1-5).\n\n- Additionally, row 4 has X's in columns 2 and 4 (but column 3 is already covered by the vertical line).\n\nWait, but row 4's X's are columns 2,3,4. So it's a horizontal line of three in row 4. So combining all, the grid has:\n\n- A vertical line in column 3.\n\n- A horizontal line in row 3.\n\n- A horizontal line segment of three cells in row 4, centered on column 3.\n\nSo the description could be: \"A vertical line down the center column, a horizontal line across the middle row, and a horizontal line of three cells in the fourth row, centered.\"\n\nBut I need to make sure that's accurate. Let me check:\n\nVertical line center column: yes, all rows have X in column 3.\n\nHorizontal line middle row: yes, row 3 all X.\n\nFourth row: columns 2,3,4 X. So that's three cells, centered. So yes.\n\nSo the description would include those three elements. That should be sufficient for someone to visualize or compare.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740665898, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2534, "prompt_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 2672}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 14:18:18.201124", "call_duration": "0:04:47.945631", "response": "DESCRIPTION: Vertical line in column 3, horizontal line in row 3, and a horizontal line of three X's in row 4 (columns 2-4).", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T14:25:45.109501", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.

The user provided their grid description, and I need to compare it with mine. My grid has a vertical line in column 3, a horizontal line in row 3, and a horizontal line of three X's in row 4 (columns 2-4). The user's description mentions a symmetrical 5x5 grid with a diamond pattern. Their center row is fully filled, which matches my row 3. But their second and fourth rows have X's in columns 2-3. Wait, in my grid, the fourth row has X's in columns 2-4, which is three X's. But according to their description, the fourth row should have X's only in columns 2-3. That might be a discrepancy. Also, their first and fifth rows have a single X in column 3, which in my grid, the first and fifth rows have an X in column 3 as part of the vertical line. So maybe that's the same. But the key difference seems to be in row 4. To confirm, I should ask about the number of X's in the fourth row. If their fourth row has two X's (columns 2-3), that's different from my three. So the question should be about row 4's X count. Alternatively, check if their grid has symmetry. Wait, their description says it's symmetrical with a diamond pattern. My grid might not be symmetrical because row 4 has three X's, but row 2 has two X's (columns 2-3?), wait no. Wait, in my grid, row 2 has X's in columns 3? Wait, my original grid was:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ (row 1)\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ (row 2)\nX X X X X (row 3)\n▢ X X X ▢ (row 4)\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ (row 5)\n\nSo row 2 has an X only in column 3. But the user's description says their second and fourth rows have X's in columns 2-3. So their row 2 has two X's (columns 2 and 3), whereas mine has only column 3. That's a difference. Similarly, their row 4 has columns 2-3, which would be two X's, but mine has three. So the diamond pattern would require symmetry. So maybe the user's grid is a diamond where each row from the center has one less X on each side. So center row (3) is all X's. Then row 2 and 4 have two X's each (columns 2-3 and 3-4?), but the user says columns 2-3 for both. Wait, maybe their diamond is narrower. So the key differences are in rows 2 and 4. To confirm, I should ask about the number of X's in row 2. If their row 2 has two X's (columns 2-3), that's different from my grid's single X in column 3. So the question should be about row 2. Alternatively, check if the vertical line in column 3 is present. Wait, my grid has a vertical line in column 3, meaning rows 1-5, column 3 all have X's. The user's grid has a diamond, which would have column 3 as the center. So their first and fifth rows have X in column 3, which matches the vertical line. But their rows 2 and 4 have X's in columns 2-3, which would add to the vertical line. Wait, in their case, row 2 has X's in 2-3, so column 3 is filled here, but column 2 is also filled. So their vertical line in column 3 is intact, but with additional X's in column 2 for rows 2 and 4. So in their grid, column 3 has X's in all rows (since row 1 and 5 have X in column 3, rows 2,3,4 also have X in column 3). So the vertical line is present. But in my grid, the vertical line is only column 3, but rows 1,2,3,4,5 all have X in column 3. Wait, in my grid, rows 1,2,3,5 have X in column 3, but row 4 has X in columns 2-4, which includes column 3. So actually, in my grid, column 3 has X's in all rows: row 1 (col3), row2 (col3), row3 (col3), row4 (col3), row5 (col3). So vertical line in column 3 is fully filled. So the user's grid also has vertical line in column 3. But their rows 2 and 4 have X's in columns 2-3, which would mean in row 2, columns 2 and 3 are X, and row 4, columns 2 and 3. Wait, but the user's description says \"The second and fourth rows have X's in columns 2-3.\" So row 2: columns 2 and 3 are X. Row 4: columns 2 and 3 are X. But in my grid, row 4 has columns 2-4 as X. So that's a difference. So the user's row 4 has two X's (cols 2-3), mine has three (cols 2-4). Therefore, the key difference is in row 4. So to confirm, I should ask about row 4. Alternatively, check if their grid has X's in columns 4 in row 4. So the question would be: \"Does row 4 have X's in columns 2, 3, and 4?\" If they say no, then the grids are different. Alternatively, since their description says columns 2-3 for row 4, which would mean only two X's, whereas mine has three. So the question should be about the number of X's in row 4. Alternatively, check symmetry. Wait, their grid is described as symmetrical. My grid: row 1 has X in col3, row2 col3, row3 all, row4 cols2-4, row5 col3. If you mirror this horizontally, row4 would have cols2-4, which is symmetric around the center (col3). So row4 has three X's centered. But the user's row4 has cols2-3, which would not be symmetric. Wait, no. If the grid is symmetrical, then row4 should mirror row2. If row2 has cols2-3, then row4 should have cols3-4 to be symmetrical. But the user says both row2 and row4 have cols2-3. That would not be symmetrical. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the user's description might have an error, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the user's grid is symmetrical in a diamond pattern. A diamond pattern would have each row from the center expanding and then contracting. So row3: all X's. Row2 and 4: three X's (cols2-4). Row1 and 5: one X in col3. But the user's description says row2 and 4 have X's in cols2-3, which would be two X's. That doesn't form a diamond. So perhaps the user's description is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user's diamond is different. Hmm. To resolve this, the best approach is to ask a question that clarifies the number of X's in row 4. So the question would be: \"Does row 4 have three X's in columns 2-4?\" If the answer is no, then the grids differ. Alternatively, since the user's description says columns 2-3 for row4, which is two X's, but my grid has three, that's a clear difference. So the question should target that.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740666186, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1730, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 2003}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 14:23:06.148534", "call_duration": "0:02:38.960923", "response": "QUESTION: Does row 4 have X's in columns 2, 3, and 4?", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T14:26:28.640616", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.

But wait, the user's description mentions a horizontal line in row 3 (which matches my grid) and a vertical line in column 3. Wait, their vertical line in column 3 would mean that every row has an X in column 3. Let me check my grid. Row 1: column 3 is X. Row 2: column 3 is X. Row 3: column 3 is X. Row 4: column 3 is X. Row 5: column 3 is X. So yes, column 3 is all X's. So vertical line in column 3 matches. Then horizontal line in row 3 (all X's) matches. But their row 4 has X's in 2-4, which in my grid is only 2-3. So the answer to their question is no. Therefore, the grids are different.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740666345, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 491, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 765}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 14:25:45.110675", "call_duration": "0:00:43.529899", "response": "ANSWER: No", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T14:28:45.401657", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.

The user's grid description mentions a vertical line in column 3, which in a 5x5 grid would mean rows 1 through 5 in column 3 all have X's. But in my grid, the vertical line is part of a diamond pattern. So my grid has X's in column 3 for all rows except maybe the edges? Wait, no. Let me check my grid again.\n\nMy grid is a diamond pattern. The center row (row 3) is all X's. Rows 2 and 4 have X's in columns 2-4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the user's grid has a horizontal line in row 3 (all X's), which matches my grid. Then, the user's row 4 has a horizontal line of three X's in columns 2-4. But in my grid, row 4 has X's in columns 2 and 3, not 2-4. Because the original description says \"The second and fourth rows have X's in columns 2-3.\" Wait, no, the user's description says their row 4 has X's in columns 2-4. So when the user asked if row 4 has X's in 2-4, I answered \"No\" because my grid's row 4 has X's in 2 and 3. So that's a difference. But the user's description also mentions a vertical line in column 3. Let me check my grid's column 3. In my grid, row 1 has an X in column 3 (since first row has a single X in center, column 3). Row 2 has X in column 3. Row 3 has X. Row 4 has X in column 3. Row 5 has X in column 3. So column 3 is all X's. So vertical line in column 3 matches. Then horizontal line in row 3 matches. But the user's row 4 has three X's (columns 2-4), while mine has two (columns 2-3). So that's a discrepancy. But the user's description also mentions a horizontal line of three X's in row 4. So their grid's row 4 has three X's, while mine has two. So the grids are different. But the user is now asking me to ask a question to find new aspects. Since we already identified that row 4 is different, maybe I should check another part. Let me think. The user's grid has a vertical line in column 3 (all X's there), which my grid also has. The horizontal line in row 3 (all X's) matches. But their row 4 has X's in 2-4. So maybe check another row. For example, row 2. In my grid, row 2 has X's in columns 2 and 3. The user's grid has a vertical line in column 3, but what about row 2? If their grid has a vertical line in column 3, then row 2, column 3 is X. But do they have any other X's in row 2? Their description says \"vertical line in column 3, horizontal line in row 3, and a horizontal line of three X's in row 4 (columns 2-4).\" So row 2 might only have X in column 3 (as part of the vertical line), but maybe not. Wait, no. The vertical line in column 3 would mean all rows in column 3 are X. So rows 1-5, column 3. Then the horizontal line in row 3 (all X's). Then row 4 has X's in 2-4. So their grid's row 2 would have X only in column 3 (from vertical line), unless there's more. But the user's description doesn't mention anything else. So their row 2 would have X only in column 3. But in my grid, row 2 has X's in columns 2 and 3. So that's another difference. So perhaps I should ask about row 2. For example, \"Does row 2 have X's in columns 2 and 3?\" If the user's answer is no (only column 3), then that's a difference. Alternatively, maybe check row 1. In my grid, row 1 has X only in column 3. The user's grid has vertical line in column 3, so row 1, column 3 is X. But do they have any other X's in row 1? Their description doesn't mention anything else except the vertical line, horizontal line in row 3, and row 4's three X's. So their row 1 would only have X in column 3. Which matches my grid. Similarly, row 5 would be the same. So the main differences are in row 2 and row 4. Since we already addressed row 4, maybe row 2 is the next point. So the question should be about row 2. Alternatively, check column 2. In my grid, column 2 has X's in rows 2,3,4. Because row 2: X in 2 and 3; row 3: all X's; row 4: X in 2 and 3. So column 2 has X's in rows 2,3,4. The user's grid: vertical line in column 3 (so column 3 has all X's). Row 3 has all X's. Row 4 has X's in 2-4. So column 2 in their grid would have X's in row 3 (from the horizontal line) and row 4 (from the three X's). But row 2: if their row 2 only has X in column 3 (from vertical line), then column 2 in row 2 is empty. So their column 2 has X's in rows 3 and 4. While mine has X's in rows 2,3,4. So another difference. So asking about column 2 could be another approach. Alternatively, ask about row 2. Let's pick row 2. So the question would be: \"Does row 2 have X's in columns 2 and 3?\" If the user answers no (only column 3), then the grids are different. Alternatively, if they answer yes, then maybe there's another difference. But according to their description, they only have vertical line in column 3, so row 2 would only have X in column 3. So the answer would be no. Hence, the grids are different. So the next question should be about row 2. Alternatively, maybe check column 2. Let me decide. The user's grid has a vertical line in column 3, so column 3 is all X's. Their row 3 is all X's. Their row 4 has X's in 2-4. So column 2 in their grid has X's in rows 3 and 4. My grid's column 2 has X's in rows 2,3,4. So if I ask, \"Does column 2 have X's in rows 2, 3, and 4?\" The user would answer no (only rows 3 and 4), which would indicate a difference. Alternatively, ask about row 2. Let's go with row 2. So the question is: \"Does row 2 have X's in columns 2 and 3?\" That's the key difference. Because in my grid, row 2 has X's in 2 and 3, but in the user's grid, row 2 would only have X in column 3 (from the vertical line). So the answer would be no, indicating a difference. Therefore, the grids are different. So the next question should be about row 2.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740666389, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1686, "prompt_tokens": 314, "total_tokens": 2000}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 14:26:28.641168", "call_duration": "0:02:16.760449", "response": "QUESTION: Does row 2 have X's in columns 2 and 3?", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T14:30:44.613098", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your grid first.
