So the grid is a 5x5 grid, right? Let me visualize it again. The first row is: ▢ X X X ▢. Then the second row is X ▢ X ▢ X. The third, fourth, and fifth rows are X X ▢ X X. Wait, no, the third row is X X ▢ X X, and the fourth and fifth rows are the same? Let me check again. The user provided:\n\n▢ X X X ▢\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X\n\nSo rows 3, 4, and 5 all have the pattern X X ▢ X X. That's interesting. So the first row has the middle three cells as X with empty on both ends. The second row alternates X, empty, X, empty, X. Then rows 3-5 have the center cell empty, surrounded by X's. Wait, no, in rows 3-5, the third cell is empty. Let me count the positions. Each row has 5 cells.\n\nRow 1: positions 1-5: empty, X, X, X, empty"}}], "created": 1740692232, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 147, "total_tokens": 418}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 21:37:12.493266", "call_duration": "0:02:27.114854", "response": "", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
