Let me check the conversation history. The user's CV mentions Spanish under OTHER-SKILLS. The recruiter asked about other skills, and the user answered they are proficient in Spanish. So the recruiter does know about that skill. Wait, but the initial prompt said the recruiter doesn't know about the CV yet. Wait, the first message from the user says the recruiter doesn't know about the CV yet. Then the recruiter started asking questions. The user answered about Spanish when asked. So the recruiter now knows because the user told them. But the user's aside question is asking if the recruiter is aware. Since the user already answered the recruiter's question about other skills by mentioning Spanish, the answer should be yes. But wait, the initial setup said the recruiter doesn't know the CV details. But through the conversation, the user revealed Spanish. So the answer is yes, the recruiter is now aware because the user told them.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740669533, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 222, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 471}, "provider": "Friendli", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 15:18:53.414085", "call_duration": "0:00:06.028906", "response": "ASIDE: Yes.", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T15:19:00.907683", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an applicant in a job interview.
