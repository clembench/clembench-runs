Let's start from the Closet, which has a direction available to the west. The goal is to explore every room without repeating if possible, right? \n\nFirst step: The Closet only has west as an available direction. So I have to go west. That should take me to the next room. Let's say that room is the Hall. Now, in the Hall, the available directions might be east (back to Closet) and maybe other directions like north or south. But since I want to minimize moves, I shouldn't go back to the Closet once I've left it. So from the Hall, I need to choose a direction that leads to a new room.\n\nWait, but how do I know which directions are available each time? The user will provide that info after each move. So in the first step, the Closet has west only. So I go west. Then, depending on the next room's available directions, I have to decide. Let's think in terms of a graph traversal. To visit all rooms with the fewest steps, a depth-first search approach might be better than breadth-first because it goes as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I need to track visited rooms to avoid cycles.\n\nBut since the user doesn't give a map, I have to keep track mentally. Let's start:\n\n1. Closet (starting point). Directions: west. So first move is GO: west.\n\nAssuming the next room is, say, Hall. Directions: east (back to Closet), north, south. Then I should go north or south, avoiding east. Let's pick north. Then in that room, directions might be south (back to Hall) and maybe another. Continue until dead end, then backtrack.\n\nBut since the user will provide the available directions each time, I need to choose directions that haven't been explored yet. But without knowing the map, how can I track which directions lead to new rooms? Wait, the problem says \"you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done\". So the key is to keep track of visited rooms and directions taken. But since the assistant can't track state between steps, the user must be handling the state, and the assistant just responds based on the current room's available directions and the need to explore all rooms.\n\nWait, but the problem is presented as a text-based interaction where the user provides the current room and available directions, and the assistant responds with GO: direction or DONE. So the assistant doesn't have to remember past steps; it's stateless. But the user is simulating the environment. So the assistant's job is to choose directions in a way that, given the current available exits, leads to visiting all rooms with minimal steps. But how can the assistant do that without knowing the map? It can't. Therefore, the assistant must follow a strategy that, given the current available directions, chooses unexplored directions first, and once all are explored, backtracks. But since the assistant can't track visited rooms, perhaps the user's simulation will present directions that include unexplored paths, and the assistant should avoid going back unless necessary.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the user starts in the Kitchen with south and west. The assistant goes west to Lobby, then north to Bedroom. Then when in Bedroom with only south, they DONE. But maybe there were other rooms, but the example is simplified. So perhaps the assistant's strategy is to always pick a direction that hasn't been taken yet, but since the assistant can't track, maybe the user's simulation is designed such that once all rooms are visited, the available directions only lead back to visited rooms, so the assistant can DONE when all exits lead to already visited rooms.\n\nBut how does the assistant know when all rooms are visited? The problem states that the assistant needs to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit. So perhaps the assistant is supposed to infer that if all available directions from the current room lead back to already visited rooms, then it's done. But without tracking, the assistant can't know which directions have been visited. Therefore, the problem must be structured such that once all rooms are visited, the available directions from the current room are all leading back, so the assistant can DONE.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the assistant should use a systematic approach, like always taking the first unexplored direction (e.g., in a certain order) and backtracking when necessary. But since the assistant can't track, perhaps the user's simulation is designed so that the assistant can follow a specific path that covers all rooms without repetition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a simple linear path. For example, Closet west to Hall, Hall north to Bedroom, Bedroom south to Hall, Hall east to Closet. But that's a loop. Wait, but the example given ends when in a room with only the exit leading back. So perhaps the correct approach is to traverse until you reach a dead end (a room with only the exit back), and then DONE, assuming that all rooms have been visited.
