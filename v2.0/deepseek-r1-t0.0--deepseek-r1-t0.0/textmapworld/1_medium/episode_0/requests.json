Let's start. The first room is the Workshop, and the only available direction is west. So I have to go west first. \n\nWait, but the goal is to visit all rooms. So maybe after going west, I need to check where that leads. Let's say I go west from the Workshop. Then I enter a new room. Let's imagine that room has other directions. But since the problem is about minimizing room changes, I should probably try to explore as much as possible in each direction before backtracking. But how do I keep track of which rooms I've already visited? The problem says I need to recognize when there are no new rooms left. \n\nHmm, but the user isn't giving me a map. So I have to assume that each move is sequential, and I have to remember the path. Wait, but in the example, the user just followed directions step by step. So maybe each time I move, the system will tell me the new room's name and available directions. So my job is to choose directions in such a way that I don't revisit rooms, thereby minimizing the total steps.\n\nSo starting in the Workshop, direction west. Let's go west. Then, suppose the next room has directions east (back to Workshop) and maybe another direction. So I need to avoid going back east unless necessary. So in each step, I should prioritize directions that haven't been explored yet. But since I don't have a map, I have to track visited rooms. Wait, but the problem says \"you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit\". So maybe the system is keeping track of visited rooms, and when all adjacent rooms from the current position are already visited, then I can DONE. But how?\n\nWait, the example shows that when in the Bedroom with only south (which was the previous room), the user says DONE. So perhaps once all available directions from the current room lead to already visited rooms, then we can stop. So the strategy is to traverse the graph in a way that covers all rooms without unnecessary backtracking, using a depth-first search approach, perhaps. But since the problem requires the fewest moves, maybe a BFS is better? Or maybe it's a tree structure, so DFS would work with backtracking but might take more steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is supposed to output the minimal number of steps, perhaps the optimal path is to go through each direction once, avoiding cycles. So whenever entering a new room, pick a direction that hasn't been taken yet, and when all directions are exhausted, backtrack. But how to do that without knowing the map in advance.\n\nWait, but the problem is presented as a text-based interaction where each step gives the current room and available directions. So the user has to make decisions step by step, choosing directions that lead to unvisited rooms. The challenge is to avoid revisiting rooms, which would waste steps. So the approach should be to always choose a direction that hasn't been taken yet (i.e., leads to a new room) and when there are no such directions, backtrack by going back the way you came, but only until you find a room with unexplored directions.\n\nBut how to track visited rooms? Since the user isn't given a map, they have to remember the path. But in the example, the user just follows directions step by step. So perhaps the correct approach is to use a backtracking approach with a stack. Each time you enter a room, you pick the first unexplored direction (not the one you came from) and proceed. If all directions except the entry point are explored, then backtrack. But since the user can't track visited rooms, maybe the system is designed such that each direction from a room leads to a unique room, and once you've taken all directions except the entry, you can DONE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rooms form a tree structure, so there are no cycles, and thus a depth-first traversal would visit all rooms with minimal backtracking. But without knowing the structure, the user has to make educated guesses.\n\nIn the initial step, the Workshop has only west. So the first move is west. Then, the next room's directions would be given. Suppose that room has directions east (back to Workshop) and another direction, say north. Then, the user should go north, not east. Then, if that room has directions south (back) and maybe another, proceed. Continue until a room with no new directions. Then backtrack.\n\nBut how to know when all rooms are visited? The system must be designed so that when all possible paths have been explored, the user can DONE. So the algorithm is similar to a DFS, where you keep track of visited rooms (though the user can't, so perhaps the system's responses implicitly do that). Wait, but the user isn't told which rooms are visited. So the user has to assume that each new direction leads to a new room unless backtracking. So the strategy is: when entering a room, take the first unexplored direction (not the one you came from). If all directions are explored (except the entry), backtrack. When you backtrack to the starting room and all directions are explored, then DONE.\n\nBut how to implement this without knowing the map. Let's think step by step.\n\nStarting in Workshop, direction west. So first move is west.\n\nNext, suppose the system says: You are in Room A. Directions: east (back to Workshop), north. So the user should go north, not east. Then, in Room B, directions: south (back to A), west. Go west. Then Room C, directions: east (back to B), etc. Continue until a dead end, then backtrack.\n\nBut the user has to remember the path. But since the user can't track, perhaps the correct approach is to always choose a direction that isn't the reverse of the previous move. For example, if you came from east, then in the current room, avoid going west (since that's the reverse) unless there are no other options. Wait, but in the example given, when in the Lobby with directions east and north, the user went north. Then, when in the Bedroom with only south, they DONE. So that suggests that once all directions except the entry are exhausted, you backtrack. But in that case, the user would have to go back to Lobby, then check if there are other directions. But in the example, the user didn't have to because the Bedroom was the last room. So maybe the system is designed such that when you reach a dead end (only exit is the way you came), you backtrack, but if that room has other exits, you take them. But how to know when all rooms are visited.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured so that once you've visited all rooms, the system will present a situation where all available directions lead to already visited rooms, so you can DONE. But the user has to infer that.\n\nIn the initial problem, the first move is west from Workshop. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n1. Workshop: west only. So GO: west.\n\nAssuming the next room is, say, Hall. Directions: east (back to Workshop) and south. So from Hall, we should go south, not east. Then, if the next room has directions north (back to Hall) and west, go west. Continue until a dead end. Then backtrack.\n\nBut the user has to make sure that all possible paths are taken. So the key is to avoid revisiting rooms. Since the user can't track, they have to rely on the system's directions. For example, if in a room, after moving in a direction, the next room's available directions include the reverse, but the user should avoid going back unless necessary.\n\nSo the strategy is:\n\n- Always choose a direction that hasn't been taken yet (i.e., not the reverse of the previous move, unless there are no other options).\n\nBut how to know which directions have been taken? The user can't track, so perhaps the system's available directions are the possible exits, and the user should choose the first unexplored one.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is designed such that each room's exits are only to new rooms or the previous room. So the user can proceed by always choosing a direction that isn't the reverse of the entry direction, thereby exploring new rooms. When all such directions are exhausted, backtrack.\n\nSo for example:\n\nStart in Workshop (west only). Go west to Room A. Room A has east (back) and north. Go north to Room B. Room B has south (back) and west. Go west to Room C. Room C has east (back) and no others. So then backtrack to B, then check if B has other exits. If not, backtrack to A, check if A has other exits. If not, backtrack to Workshop. Then, since Workshop has no other exits, DONE.\n\nBut the user has to make these decisions step by step. So in code terms, this is a depth-first search with backtracking. But the user has to simulate that without knowing the map.\n\nIn the example given, the user went west, then north, then when in Bedroom with only south, they DONE. But that's because there were no other rooms. So perhaps the system is designed such that when you reach a dead end (only exit is the way you came), and you backtrack, but if the previous room has no other exits, you continue backtracking until you find a room with unexplored exits. Once all are explored, then DONE.\n\nSo applying this to the initial problem:\n\nFirst step: Workshop, west only. So GO: west.\n\nAssuming the next room (Room A) has directions east (back) and another direction, say north. So GO: north.\n\nNext room (Room B) has directions south (back) and maybe west. GO: west.\n\nNext room (Room C) has directions east (back) and maybe south. GO: south.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. The key is to always choose a direction that's not the reverse of the entry, unless forced. So in each step, after entering a room from a certain direction, the available directions are listed. The user should pick the first direction that isn't the reverse. If there are none, then backtrack (i.e., go back the way you came). If that's the case, then when you backtrack to a previous room, you check if there are other directions to explore. If not, continue backtracking.\n\nBut how does the user know when all rooms are visited? The system must present a situation where all available directions in the current room lead back to already visited rooms, so the user can DONE.\n\nIn the example, the user ended in Bedroom with only south (which was the way they came), so they DONE. Because there were no new rooms left.\n\nSo applying this logic to the initial problem:\n\nStart in Workshop. Directions: west. So GO: west.\n\nNext room: let's say it's Hall. Directions: east (back) and north. So GO: north.\n\nNext room: Bedroom. Directions: south (back) and west. GO: west.\n\nNext room: Bathroom. Directions: east (back).
