The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next command?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next command?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next command?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to help the user navigate through all the rooms with the fewest moves possible. The starting point is the Billiard room, and the available directions are south and west. The goal is to visit every room without repeating and then stop when there are no new rooms left. \n\nFirst, I should think about the most efficient path. Since we want to minimize room changes, maybe a depth-first search approach would work here. That way, we go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I need to keep track of visited rooms to avoid loops.\n\nStarting in the Billiard room. Directions are south and west. Let's pick one direction. Let's say west first. If I go west, the next room might have other exits. Then from there, explore further. But I need to remember to check the other direction (south) later if needed. Wait, but how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Maybe it's better to pick one direction and go until a dead end, then backtrack. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rooms form a certain layout. For example, if going west leads to a room that connects back to the Billiard room via another path, that could create a loop. But since the user hasn't provided a map, I have to make decisions based on the current available exits each time. \n\nSo the first move"}}], "created": 1740579462, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 287, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 539}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 14:17:42.087317", "call_duration": "0:03:11.328963", "response": "", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
