The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

Let's start with the initial information. The user is in the Cellar, and the only available direction is north. The goal is to visit all rooms efficiently, keeping track of the graph as we go. \n\nFirst step: From the Cellar, the only option is to go north. So I'll move north. The graph should now include the Cellar and the next room. Let's say the next room is, I don't know, maybe the Hall. So the nodes would be [\"Cellar\", \"Hall\"], and the edges would have north from Cellar to Hall. Then, when the user moves north, the edges for north would have (\"Cellar\", \"Hall\"). \n\nWait, but in the example, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge was [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the direction from the starting room to the new room is the direction taken. So if I go north from Cellar to Hall, then the north edge in the graph would have (\"Cellar\", \"Hall\"). \n\n"}}], "created": 1740650956, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 234, "prompt_tokens": 461, "total_tokens": 695}, "provider": "Fireworks", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 10:09:15.863285", "call_duration": "0:00:05.596661", "response": "", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
