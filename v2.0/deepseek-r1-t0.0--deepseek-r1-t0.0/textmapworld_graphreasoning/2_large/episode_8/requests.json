Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].

Let's start by understanding the problem. The user is in the Studio, and the available directions are west, north, and south. My goal is to explore all rooms efficiently, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nFirst, I should decide which direction to take first. Since the starting point is the Studio, I need to choose a direction that might lead to the most efficient path. Maybe I should pick one direction and then backtrack if needed. Let's think about depth-first search versus breadth-first search. Since we want to minimize room changes, maybe a DFS approach would be better because it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. That way, we might cover more new rooms without revisiting as much.\n\nSo, starting at Studio. Available directions: west, north, south. Let's pick one direction. Let's say west first. Then, when we enter the next room, we'll note the connection in the graph. But wait, the example shows that when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added as west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So each direction's edge list contains pairs of rooms connected in that direction.\n\nBut how do I track which rooms are connected? Each time I move, I need to add the new room to the nodes and create the appropriate edges. For example, moving west from Studio to Room A would add an edge west from Studio to Room A. Then, if Room A has directions, say east (back to Studio) and another direction, I need to explore those.\n\nBut the challenge is to visit all rooms with the fewest moves. So maybe I should prioritize moving to directions that haven't been explored yet. But since I don't know the map in advance, I have to build it as I go. So the strategy would be to always go to an unexplored direction first, and if all directions from the current room are explored, backtrack.\n\nWait, but how do I know which directions are unexplored? Because each time I enter a room, the available directions are given, but some of those directions might lead to already visited rooms. For example, if I go west from Studio to Room A, then Room A's east direction leads back to Studio. So when I'm in Room A, if I go east, I return to Studio, which is already visited. So to avoid unnecessary moves, I should keep track of visited rooms and avoid going back unless necessary.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Keep a list of visited rooms.\n2. From the current room, check available directions.\n3. For each direction, if moving in that direction leads to a new room (not yet visited), take that direction.\n4. If all directions from the current room lead to visited rooms, backtrack by going back the way you came (using the graph to know which direction leads back to the previous room).\n\nBut how do I track the path to backtrack? Maybe using a stack to keep track of the path taken. Each time I move to a new room, push the current room and the direction taken onto the stack. When backtracking, pop from the stack and move in the opposite direction.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is being built, each room's connections can be tracked. For example, if I'm in Room B, and I came from the south (from Studio), then the north direction of Studio leads to Room B, and the south direction of Room B leads back to Studio. So when in Room B, if all other directions (other than south) are explored, then I can go back south to Studio.\n\nBut the problem is that the available directions in each room are given, but the user doesn't know which directions lead to new rooms or existing ones. So the user has to explore each direction, but to minimize moves, they should avoid revisiting rooms unless necessary.\n\nSo the algorithm would be similar to a DFS, where you go as far as possible in one direction, then backtrack when you hit a dead end.\n\nLet's apply this to the initial problem. Starting at Studio. Directions: west, north, south.\n\nFirst, choose a direction. Let's pick north. Then, when entering the new room (let's call it Room A), check its directions. Suppose Room A has directions south (back to Studio) and east. Then, go east to Room B. If Room B has directions west (back to Room A) and north, go north to Room C, etc., until no new rooms. Then backtrack.\n\nBut since the user doesn't know the map in advance, they have to choose directions and track which ones have been explored.\n\nBut in the problem, the user has to output the graph as they go. So each move, they add the new room to the nodes and the edge in the direction they moved. Also, when moving back, they need to add the reverse edge if it's not already there.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added as west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Then, when moving north from Library to Kitchen, the edge north: [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. Then, when moving east from Kitchen, perhaps to another room, but in the example, the next step is entering Bedroom, which has directions south and west. So the edges are added as per the direction moved.\n\nBut when moving back, say from Kitchen to Library via south, that would"}}], "created": 1740662014, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1140, "prompt_tokens": 464, "total_tokens": 1604}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:13:33.712367", "call_duration": "0:04:49.576398", "response": "", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
