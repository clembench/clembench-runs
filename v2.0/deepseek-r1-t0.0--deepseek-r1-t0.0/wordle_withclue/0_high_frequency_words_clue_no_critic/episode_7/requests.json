You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: support crew\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740590879-JzDfR4ZfQquP97daL1Pg", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "explanation: \"Support crew\" suggests a group providing assistance, often referred to as staff. \"Staff\" is a 5-letter term commonly associated with a team or workforce offering support.  \nguess: staff", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Wordle clue: \"support crew\". Hmm, I need to think of a 5-letter word related to support or a crew. First, \"support\" makes me think of words like help, aid, back, or assist, but those are either too short or not 5 letters. \"Crew\" is a group of people working together, like a team or staff. \n\nSo combining both ideas, maybe a word that means a group providing support. \"Staff\" comes to mindâ€”it's 5 letters and refers to a group of employees. Another option could be \"squad\", but that's more about a team, maybe military. \"Crew\" itself is 4 letters. \"Troop\" is another possibility, but again, more military. \n\nWait, \"support crew\" could also relate to technical support. Maybe \"techs\"? But that's 5 letters. Or \"aides\"? But that's 5 letters too. Let me check. \"Aides\" is 5 letters, but maybe \"staff\" is more common. Alternatively, \"boost\" as in boosting support, but that's more about encouragement.\n\nAnother angle: \"support\" as in structural support. Words like \"brace\" or \"truss\", but those might not relate to a crew. Maybe \"group\" as in a support group, but that's too generic. \n\nWait, \"support crew\" in events or film might be called \"grips\" or \"gophers\", but \"grips\" is 5 letters. Hmm. Or \"hands\" as in helping hands. But \"hands\" is 5 letters. \n\nAlternatively, \"staff\" seems the most straightforward. Let's go with that first. If the feedback shows some letters wrong, I can adjust. So the explanation would link \"support crew\" to a group of workers, hence \"staff\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590879, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 718}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:27:58.824542", "call_duration": "0:00:42.387517", "response": "explanation: \"Support crew\" suggests a group providing assistance, often referred to as staff. \"Staff\" is a 5-letter term commonly associated with a team or workforce offering support.  \nguess: staff", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
