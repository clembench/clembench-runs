You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: calendar page\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740590647-FadKQXdVR0Nb0ZJk5MnL", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "explanation: A calendar page typically represents a specific month, and \"month\" is a 5-letter word directly related to the structure of a calendar.  \nguess: month", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Wordle clue: \"calendar page\". Hmm, a calendar page usually has dates, months, days. The target word is a 5-letter English word. So, maybe something related to parts of a calendar.\n\nFirst thought: \"month\" is a 5-letter word. Each month is a page in a calendar. That makes sense. But let me think of other possibilities. \"Daily\" is 5 letters, but that's more about days. \"Sheet\" could be a page, but maybe not specific to a calendar. \"Week\" is four letters. \"Dates\" is five letters, but plural. Wait, the answer needs to be a single word, so maybe \"month\" is the best bet. Let me check if there's another angle. \"Agenda\" is longer. \"Plate\" doesn't fit. \"Chart\" is not specific. \"Paper\" is a page, but again, not calendar-specific. So \"month\" seems like the most direct answer. Let's go with that.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590647, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 535}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:24:07.169545", "call_duration": "0:00:50.169391", "response": "explanation: A calendar page typically represents a specific month, and \"month\" is a 5-letter word directly related to the structure of a calendar.  \nguess: month", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
