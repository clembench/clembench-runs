First, I need to figure out what five-letter word fits the blank. Sammy Kaye was a big band leader, so maybe the song title is \"Something Tomorrow.\" Wait, \"Something\" is too long. Let me think. Oh, \"Dream\" maybe? There's a song called \"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" but that's not Sammy Kaye. Wait, Sammy Kaye had a hit called \"(There'll Be a) Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)\" but that's not it. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"Swing\" as in swing music? \"Swing Tomorrow\"? Not sure. Let me check. Oh, Sammy Kaye's hits include \"Remember Pearl Harbor\" and \"I Left My Heart at the Stage Door Canteen,\" but those don't fit. Wait, maybe \"Until Tomorrow\"? That's a five-letter word. \"Until\" is five letters. So \"Until Tomorrow\" would make sense. Let me confirm if Sammy Kaye had a song titled \"Until Tomorrow.\" Alternatively, \"After Tomorrow\"? No, \"After\" is five letters. Wait, but the clue is \"___ tomorrow\" so the blank is a five-letter word. Let me think of five-letter words that precede \"tomorrow\" in song titles. \"Until\" is five letters. \"Until Tomorrow\" – does that song exist? Maybe. Alternatively, \"Dream\" as in \"Dream Tomorrow,\" but I'm not sure. Another angle: Sammy Kaye's 1940s hits. Oh, \"The Old Lamplighter\" was a hit for him, but that's not it. Wait, \"Room Full of Roses\" maybe? No. Alternatively, \"Harbor Lights\" – no. Wait, maybe \"White Christmas\"? No, that's Bing Crosby. Let me think again. The structure is \"___ tomorrow\" with the blank being a five-letter word. Maybe \"After Tomorrow\"? \"After\" is five letters. But I'm not sure if that's a Sammy Kaye song. Alternatively, \"Until\" seems plausible. Let me check: \"Until Tomorrow\" by Sammy Kaye? A quick search in my mind... I think he had a song called \"Until Tomorrow\" in the 1940s. If that's the case, then the answer would be \"until\". Let me confirm the letters: U-N-T-I-L. Yes, five letters. So the guess should be \"until\". But wait, maybe \"later\"? \"Later tomorrow\" doesn't make much sense. \"After\" is another option, but \"after tomorrow\" is a phrase. However, \"after\" is five letters. But I think \"until\" is more likely to be the Sammy Kaye hit. So my first guess would be \"until\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590952, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 645, "prompt_tokens": 290, "total_tokens": 935}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:29:11.931674", "call_duration": "0:00:56.437187", "response": "explanation: The clue \"___ tomorrow\" references a Sammy Kaye song title.
