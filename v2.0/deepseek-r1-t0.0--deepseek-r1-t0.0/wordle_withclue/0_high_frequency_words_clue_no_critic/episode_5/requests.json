That's pretty early in TV history. Maybe a long-running show? Let me think. \"The Today Show\" started in 1952, but that's more than five letters. Wait, \"Today\" is five letters. But does \"Today\" match the date? The Today Show premiered on January 14, 1952. So the word could be \"today\". Let me check: T-O-D-A-Y. Five letters. The clue says \"tv show since 1/14/52\", which matches the start date of The Today Show. So the guess should be \"today\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590831, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 288, "total_tokens": 538}, "provider": "Friendli", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:27:11.473769", "call_duration": "0:00:05.512805", "response": "explanation: The clue refers to the premiere date of \"The Today Show\" on January 14, 1952.
