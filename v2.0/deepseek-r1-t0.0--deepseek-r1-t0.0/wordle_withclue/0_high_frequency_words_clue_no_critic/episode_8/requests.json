Heart had several popular songs around that time. One of their biggest hits from the mid-80s is \"What About Love,\" which was released in 1985. The title is three words, but Wordle requires a 5-letter word. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the years. Another big hit they had was \"These Dreams,\" which came out in 1986, so that's a bit later. Then there's \"Never,\" but that's from 1985 as well. Wait, \"Never\" is a 5-letter word. Let me confirm: \"Never\" was a single from their 1985 album. Yes, that's right. The song \"Never\" by Heart was a hit in 1985. So the 5-letter word would be \"never.\" Let me check if that fits. The clue says \"1985 hit by Heart,\" and \"never\" is a 5-letter word. That seems to fit. I'll go with \"never\" as the first guess.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590921, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 286, "total_tokens": 575}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:28:41.259742", "call_duration": "0:00:30.617976", "response": "explanation: The band Heart had a hit song titled \"Never\" released in 1985.
