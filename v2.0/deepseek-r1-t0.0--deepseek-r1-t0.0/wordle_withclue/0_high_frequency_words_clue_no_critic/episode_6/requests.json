You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: \"...called for his fiddlers ___\"\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740590837-qZR5VQ78SGc48b5Jshtq", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "explanation: The clue references the nursery rhyme \"Old King Cole,\" which ends with \"...called for his fiddlers three.\" The word \"three\" fits the five-letter requirement and completes the phrase.\nguess: three", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Wordle clue: \"...called for his fiddlers ___\". Hmm, the phrase \"called for his fiddlers ___\" sounds familiar. I think it's part of a nursery rhyme or a children's song. Let me think... Oh, right! There's the nursery rhyme \"Old King Cole\". The lyrics go something like \"Old King Cole was a merry old soul, and a merry old soul was he; He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl, and he called for his fiddlers three.\" So the missing word here should be \"three\" because the line is \"fiddlers three\". \n\nBut wait, \"three\" is a five-letter word? Let me check. T-H-R-E-E â€“ yes, that's five letters. So the target word is likely \"three\". The clue is referencing the completion of the line from the nursery rhyme. Let me make sure there aren't other possibilities. The phrase ends with \"___\", so it's the last word. The only word that fits there is \"three\". I don't think there's another five-letter word that would make sense in that context. So my first guess should be \"three\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740590837, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 287, "total_tokens": 580}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 17:27:17.049612", "call_duration": "0:00:41.711439", "response": "explanation: The clue references the nursery rhyme \"Old King Cole,\" which ends with \"...called for his fiddlers three.\" The word \"three\" fits the five-letter requirement and completes the phrase.\nguess: three", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
