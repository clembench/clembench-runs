Hmm, the word needs to be five letters. The clue is \"fast\", so I should think of synonyms or related words. Words like quick, swift, rapid. But they need to be five letters. Let's see:\n\nQuick is five letters, but wait, \"quick\" is Q-U-I-C-K. That's five letters. But maybe \"swift\" is another option. Wait, \"swift\" is S-W-I-F-T, also five letters. \"Rapid\" is R-A-P-I-D, five letters too. But which one is more likely? Let me think about common Wordle answers. \"Quick\" might be a good guess. Alternatively, \"speedy\" but that's six letters. \"Fleet\" is another synonym, F-L-E-E-T. That's five letters. Oh, \"fleet\" could work. Or \"hasty\", H-A-S-T-Y. Also five letters. \n\nWait, the clue is \"fast\". Maybe the word is \"speed\"? But \"speed\" is five letters. S-P-E-E-D. That's possible. But \"speed\" is a noun, but maybe it's used as a verb. Alternatively, \"racer\" might be related, but that's more about someone who is fast. \"Brisk\" is another option, B-R-I-S-K. Hmm. Let me consider which of these are more common in English. \"Quick\" is a common adjective. \"Swift\" is also possible. \"Rapid\" is an adjective but often used in plural, \"rapids\". \"Fleet\" as an adjective means fast. So maybe \"fleet\" is a good first guess. Let me check the letters. F-L-E-E-T. If I guess \"fleet\", the feedback could help narrow down. Alternatively, \"quick\" starts with Q, which is less common. Maybe \"swift\" is better. Let's go with \"swift\" as the first guess. Wait, but the clue is \"fast\", and \"swift\" is a direct synonym. So explanation would be that \"swift\" is a synonym for fast and has five letters. Guess: swift. But maybe \"quick\" is more straightforward. Alternatively, \"speed\" as a noun. Hmm. Let me think again. The example given was \"apple\" for \"snowy white\" because of Snow White and the poisoned apple. So maybe the clue is a direct reference to a word associated with the clue. For \"fast\", maybe \"racer\" is a possibility, but \"racer\" is a noun. Alternatively, \"sprint\" but that's six letters. Wait, \"sprinter\" is too long. Maybe \"dash\"? D-A-S-H is four letters. Not enough. \"Haste\" is H-A-S-T-E, five letters. That's a noun meaning speed. But the clue is \"fast\", an adjective. \"Hasty\" is an adjective. So \"hasty\" could be a candidate. H-A-S-T-Y. But maybe the answer is \"quick\". Let me check the letters again. Q-U-I-C-K. Q is a high-value letter, so if it's in the word, the feedback would help. But maybe the answer is \"swift\".

Wait, \"quick\" has a 'q' which wasn't in the feedback. But wait, the feedback for \"swift\" had all letters wrong, so 'q' might still be possible. Wait, no, the feedback only tells me about the letters in the guess. Since \"swift\" had all red, that means the target word doesn't have s, w, i, f, or t. So I need to avoid those letters.\n\nOther synonyms for \"fast\" could be \"rapid,\" but \"rapid\" has 'r', 'a', 'p', 'i', 'd'. Wait, but 'i' was in \"swift\" and was red, so \"rapid\" has an 'i' which is excluded. So \"rapid\" is out. What else? \"Speedy\" has 's' and 'e', but 's' is already red. \"Hasty\" has 'h', 'a', 's', 't', 'y'—but 's' and 't' are red. \"Fleet\" has 'f' and 't', which are red. \"Brisk\" has 'b', 'r', 'i', 's', 'k'—again, 'i' and 's' are red. \n\nWait, maybe \"fast\" as a noun? Like \"racer\"? But \"racer\" has 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'r'. None of those letters were in the first guess. So 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e' are possible. Let me check. The clue is \"fast,\" so \"racer\" could fit. Another option: \"quick\" but 'q' is allowed. Wait, \"quick\" has 'q', 'u', 'i', 'c', 'k'. But 'i' is red from the first guess, so \"quick\" is out. \n\nAlternatively, \"agile\" but that's more about flexibility. \"Nimble\" is six letters. \"Hurry\" is five letters but has 'h', 'u', 'r', 'r', 'y'. 'H' and 'u' are new. \"Rapid\" is out because of 'i'. Maybe \"alacrity\" but that's too long. Wait, the target is five letters. Let me think again. \n\nSince all letters in \"swift\" are excluded, the target word must be a synonym of \"fast\" without s, w, i, f, t. Let's think of other words. \"Quick\" is out because of 'i'. \"Brisk\" has 'i' and 's'. \"Haste\" has 's' and 't'. \"Dash\" is four letters. \"Dart\" is four letters. \"Zippy\" has 'z', 'i', 'p', 'p', 'y'—'i' is red. \"Rush\" is four letters. \"Lick\" is four letters. \"Apace\" is a five-letter word meaning quickly. Let's check: a, p, a, c, e. None of those letters were in \"swift,\" so they might be possible. \"Apace\" could be a candidate. Another option: \"expedite\" is too long. \"Prompt\" has 'p', 'r', 'o', 'm', 'p', 't'—but 't' is red. \"Pronto\" is six letters. \"Celerity\" is too long. \"Hasten\" has 'h', 'a', 's', 't', 'e'—'s' and 't' are red. \n\nWait, maybe \"early\"? But \"early\" is more about time than speed. \"Fleet\" is out. \"Apace\" seems possible. Let me check if \"apace\" is a valid Wordle word. It's a bit less common, but possible. Alternatively, \"quick\" is invalid because of 'i'. Maybe \"racer\" as I thought before. Let's see: 'r', 'a', 'c', 'e', 'r'. None of those letters are in the excluded list. \"Racer\" is a five-letter word meaning someone or something that races, which is related to speed. That seems plausible.

So the target word has an 'a' but not in the second position.\n\nHmm, synonyms for fast... Maybe \"quick\"? But that's six letters. Wait, \"rapid\" is five letters. Let me check the letters. R is red from \"racer,\" so if \"rapid\" has an R, that might be a problem. But wait, in \"racer,\" R was in the first and fifth positions, both red. So maybe R isn't in the word at all. But \"rapid\" starts with R, which is red, so that's out.\n\nAnother synonym: \"speedy.\" That's six letters. \"Hasty\" is five letters. H-A-S-T-Y. Let's see. The previous guesses had S, W, I, F, T, R, C, E all red. So S and T are red, so \"hasty\" has S and T, which are excluded. Not good.\n\nWhat about \"fleet\"? F was red in the first guess, so F is out. \"Nimble\"? N-I-M-B-L-E is six letters. \"Brisk\"? B-R-I-S-K. B is new, R is red, I is red, S is red, K is new. But R and S are already red. Maybe not.\n\nWait, \"agile\"? A is yellow, so it's in the word but not in position 2. A-G-I-L-E. But I and E were red in previous guesses. So I and E might not be in the word. Hmm.\n\nWait, the feedback for \"racer\" had A as yellow. So the word has an A, but not in position 2. Let's think of five-letter words meaning fast that include A but not the other excluded letters. \"Haste\"? But S and T are red. \"Lapid\"? Not a common word. \"Amber\"? Not related to speed. \"Ahead\"? Not related. \"Acute\"? Not exactly. \"Alert\"? Maybe, but not directly meaning fast. \"Arrow\"? Fast-moving, but maybe a stretch. \"Apace\"? That's an adverb meaning quickly, but it's five letters: A-P-A-C-E. But E was red in \"racer,\" so E is out. So maybe not.\n\nWait, \"quicker\" is too long. \"Quick\" is five letters. Q-U-I-C-K. But Q and U might not have been tested yet. Let's check: previous guesses were \"swift\" (S, W, I, F, T) and \"racer\" (R, A, C, E, R). So Q and U haven't been tried. But \"quick\" has U, I, C, K. I and C were red in previous feedback. So I is red, C is red. So \"quick\" might have I and C which are excluded. So maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the word is \"alacrity,\" but that's too long. \"Accel\" (short for accelerate)? Not a standard five-letter word. \"Hurry\"? H-U-R-R-Y. R is red, so that's out. \"Dart\"? D-A-R-T. R is red, T is red. \"Dash\"? D-A-S-H. S is red. \"Ahead\" again. Hmm.\n\nWait, \"amply\" isn't related. \"Amber\" no. \"Aorta\"? No. Wait, \"adept\"? Not exactly fast. \"Adren\"? No. \"Agile\" again. Maybe \"agile\" is possible, but I and E are red. Wait, in \"racer,\" E was red, so E isn't in the word. So \"agile\" has E, which is excluded. So not.\n\nWait, maybe \"zesty\"? Not related. \"Zippy\"? Z-I-P-P-Y. Z is new, but I and P might be issues. I was red in \"swift,\" so maybe I is out. So \"zippy\" has I, which is red. Not good.\n\nWait, \"brisk\" is B-R-I-S-K. R and I and S are red. So that's out. \"Blitz\"? B-L-I-T-Z. I and T are red. \"Blink\"? Not related. \"Burst\"? Maybe, but not exactly fast. \"Bolt\"? B-O-L-T. T is red. \"Beast\"? Not related. \"Blare\"? No.\n\nWait, maybe \"haste\" again, but S and T are red. \"Haste\" is H-A-S-T-E. S, T, E all red. So no.\n\nWait, \"racer\" had A yellow. So the word has an A, but not in position 2. Let's think of words with A in positions 1,3,4,5. For example, \"apace\" (A in 1 and 3), but E is red. \"Aorta\" (A in 1), but not related. \"Amaze\"? No. \"Aegis\"? No. \"Agate\"? No. \"Alarm\"? Not related. \"Acute\"? No. \"Afoot\"? Maybe, but not exactly. \"Adopt\"? No.\n\nWait, maybe \"amply\" isn't right. \"Amber\"? No. \"Award\"? No. \"Abate\"? No. \"Abide\"? No. \"Abyss\"? No. \"Acrid\"? No. \"Actor\"? No. \"Acute\"? No. \"Adore\"? No. \"Adorn\"? No. \"Adult\"? No. \"Affix\"? F is red. \"After\"? F and T are red. \"Again\"?

So \"arrow\" has two R's, which are red. So that's out.\n\nWait, maybe \"abuzz\"? No. \"Abhor\"? No. \"Abide\"? No. \"Ablaze\"? No. \"Aboard\"? No. \"Abode\"? No. \"About\"? No. \"Above\"?

Maybe I'm missing something. The clue is \"fast,\" and the only correct letter so far is A, which is yellow in position 2. So the word has an A, but not in position 2. Let's think of five-letter words meaning fast that have A in positions 1,3,4, or 5.\n\nWait, \"hasty\" has A in position 2, which is yellow, but in \"racer,\" A was in position 2 and yellow. So the target word's A is not in position 2. So \"hasty\" is out. What about \"haste\"? A in position 2 again. No.\n\nWait, \"apace\" has A in 1 and 3. But E is red. \"Ahead\" has A in 1. \"Ahead\" is H-A-E-A-D. But E is red. \"Alack\"? No. \"Alamo\"? No. \"Alarm\"? No. \"Algae\"? No. \"Alpha\"? No. \"Amass\"? No. \"Amaze\"? No. \"Amber\"?

No. \"Azure\"? No.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe the word isn't a direct synonym but related. \"Fast\" can also mean to abstain from food, but that's probably not the case here. Or \"fast\" as in secure, like \"fasten,\" but that's six letters. \"Fasts\" is plural. \"Fasti\"? Not common.\n\nWait, maybe \"quick\" is the answer. Let's check the letters. Q-U-I-C-K. In previous guesses, \"swift\" had I and T red. \"racer\" had C and R red. So \"quick\" has U (untested), I (red), C (red), K (untested). So I and C are red, so \"quick\" would have two red letters. But maybe the feedback would show that. But the user's feedback for \"racer\" had C as red. So \"quick\" has C, which is red. So that's not good.\n\nWait, maybe \"quack\"? No, that's not related. \"Quark\"? No. \"Quash\"? No. \"Queen\"? No. \"Query\"? No. \"Quest\"? No. \"Queue\"? No. \"Quick\"? As before. \"Quiet\"? No. \"Quill\"? No. \"Quilt\"? No. \"Quirk\"? No. \"Quoth\"? No. \"Quota\"? No. \"Quote\"? No.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the word is \"blitz,\" but B-L-I-T-Z. I and T are red. \"Blare\"? No. \"Blast\"? S and T are red. \"Bleat\"? E and T are red. \"Blend\"? No. \"Blink\"? No. \"Bliss\"? S is red. \"Blitz\"? As before. \"Blond\"? No. \"Blood\"? No. \"Bloom\"? No. \"Blown\"? No. \"Blues\"? No. \"Bluff\"? F is red. \"Blunt\"?

The target word is a five-letter synonym for \"fast.\" Previous guesses: \"swift\" all letters red, \"racer\" with A yellow. So the word contains A but not in position 2, and excludes S, W, I, F, T, R, C, E. So possible letters are A, plus others not in those excluded. Let's think of synonyms again. \"Nimble\" is six letters. \"Quick\" has Q, U, I, C, K. I and C are excluded. \"Rapid\" has R, which is excluded. \"Speedy\" is six letters. \"Hasty\" has S and T excluded. \"Fleet\" has F and T excluded. \"Brisk\" has R and S excluded. \"Zippy\" has I excluded. \"Lively\"? Not exactly. \"Agile\" has A, but E is excluded. \"Alert\"? Not exactly. \"Apace\"? E is excluded. \"Amble\"? No. \"Accel\"? No. \"Adren\"? No. \"Arrow\"? R excluded. \"Dart\"? T excluded. \"Dash\"? S excluded. \"Zoom\"? Z-O-O-M. Four letters. \"Zoom\" is four letters, but maybe \"zooms\" is five, but S is excluded. \"Zesty\"? Not related. \"Zonal\"? No. \"Zippy\" again. \"Yacht\"? Not related. \"Yeast\"? No. \"Yield\"? No. \"Yodel\"? No. \"Young\"? No. \"Youth\"? No. \"Yummy\"? No. \"Zebra\"? No. \"Zesty\"? No. \"Zilch\"? No. \"Zonal\"? No. \"Zones\"? No. \"Zooms\"?

Maybe I need to consider that the clue might be a homonym or a different meaning. \"Fast\" can also mean fixed securely, like \"fasten,\" but that's six letters. \"Fasts\" is plural. \"Fasti\" is a term from Roman calendars, but not common. \"Fasty\" isn't a word. \"Fasten\" is six letters. \"Faster\" is six letters. \"Fastly\" is an adverb but not common. \"Fastball\"? No. \"Fasten\"? No.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"alacrity,\" but that's eight letters. \"Accel\"? No. \"Apace\"? Five letters, but E is red. \"Ahead\"? Not related. \"Agile\"? E is red. \"Alert\"?
