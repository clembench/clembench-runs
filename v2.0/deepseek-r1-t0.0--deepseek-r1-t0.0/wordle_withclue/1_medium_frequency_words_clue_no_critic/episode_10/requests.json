Hmm, fruit jelly is typically made from fruits, right? So the source would be a fruit that's commonly used to make jelly. Common jelly fruits include grapes, berries like strawberries or raspberries, maybe even apples or oranges. But the target word has to be five letters. Let's think.\n\nGrapes is six letters, so that's out. Apple is five letters. Apple jelly is a thing. But wait, the example already used apple for a different clue. Maybe another fruit. Let's see. Quince? That's six letters. Peach? Five letters. Peach jelly exists. But is there a more common one? Maybe \"guava\"? No, that's five letters but not sure if it's a common jelly source. How about \"plum\"? Plum jelly is a thing, and plum is four letters. Wait, no, plum is four letters. Hmm. What about \"berry\"? That's five letters. But berry is a category, not a specific fruit. Wait, maybe \"grape\" is five letters if we consider it singular? No, grape is singular, but the plural is grapes. So grape is five letters. Wait, G-R-A-P-E is five letters. Yes! Grape jelly is super common. So maybe the answer is grape. Let me check. Grape is five letters, fits the clue. So the first guess should be grape. But wait, let me think again. Are there other possibilities? Maybe \"apple\" again, but the example used it. The clue is different here. The example clue was \"snowy white\" leading to apple because of Snow White and the poisoned apple. Here, \"fruit jelly source\" could still be apple, since apples are used for jelly. But maybe grape is more likely. Alternatively, \"peach\" is five letters. Peach jelly is also made. Hmm. Which is more common? Grape jelly is very common in the US, like in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. So grape might be the better guess. Let's go with grape.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740608241, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 482, "prompt_tokens": 283, "total_tokens": 765}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 22:17:20.860088", "call_duration": "0:01:41.405619", "response": "explanation: The clue \"fruit jelly source\" suggests a fruit commonly used to make jelly.

Other fruits used for jelly: maybe \"guava\"? But that's five letters. Wait, guava is five letters: G, U, A, V, A. But the feedback has G and A in positions 1 and 3. So if I try guava, the G is already green in position 1, and A is green in position 3. But the second letter in guava is U, which wasn't in the previous guess. The feedback said R, P, E are red, so those letters shouldn't be in the word. So R, P, E are out. So the word can't have those letters. So possible letters for positions 2,4,5 are not R, P, E. \n\nWait, but maybe the correct letters are G and A in positions 1 and 3. Let's think of other fruits. What about \"grapefruit\"? No, that's too long. \"Gourd\"? Not a jelly source. \"Gooseberry\"? Also too long. \"Guava\" is possible. Let's check the letters. G in position 1, A in position 3. The second letter would be U, which wasn't in the previous guess. The fourth and fifth letters would be V and A. But the feedback for the first guess had P as red, so P isn't in the word. So \"guava\" doesn't have P, R, E. Let's see if that fits. Alternatively, \"gummy\" isn't a fruit. \"Grape\" had G and A correct. Maybe \"gala\"? But that's four letters. Wait, maybe \"guava\" is the answer. Let me check the letters again. G (green), U (new), A (green), V (new), A (new). The feedback didn't mention U, V, so they could be possible. Since R, P, E are excluded, \"guava\" fits.
