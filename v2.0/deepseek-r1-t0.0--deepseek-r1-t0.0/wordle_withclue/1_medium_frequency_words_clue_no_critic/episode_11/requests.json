You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: hint at\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740608370-LXfHcrbUhG0u2ozZD4Cf", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "explanation: The clue \"hint at\" suggests indirectly indicating something. \"Imply\" is a 5-letter word meaning to suggest something without explicit statement, aligning with the clue.  \nguess: imply", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this Wordle clue \"hint at\". The goal is to find a 5-letter word that relates to this phrase. First, I need to think about what \"hint at\" means. A hint is a clue or suggestion, so the word might be something that means to suggest indirectly. Words like \"imply\" come to mind because when you imply something, you're hinting at it without stating it directly. Let me check if \"imply\" is 5 letters. Wait, \"imply\" is 5 letters: I-M-P-L-Y. That fits. Are there other possibilities? Maybe \"allude\" but that's 6 letters. \"Suggest\" is too long. \"Insinuate\" is also longer. So \"imply\" seems like the best fit. Let me make sure there's no other 5-letter word I'm missing. \"Point\" could be a stretch, but \"hint at\" is more about indirect suggestion. Yeah, \"imply\" makes sense.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740608370, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 542}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-26 22:19:30.525226", "call_duration": "0:00:44.860177", "response": "explanation: The clue \"hint at\" suggests indirectly indicating something. \"Imply\" is a 5-letter word meaning to suggest something without explicit statement, aligning with the clue.  \nguess: imply", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
