Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The task is to give directions using \"GO: DIRECTION\" until we reach the target, then say \"DONE\". \n\nWait, the initial prompt says the target is the Cellar, and the user is already in the Cellar. The available directions are east and north. But since the user is already in the target room, shouldn't the answer be \"DONE\" immediately? Let me check the example again. In the example, when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they responded with DONE. So even though there are directions available in the target room, once you're there, you just say DONE. \n\nSo in this case, the user starts in the Cellar, which is the target. Therefore, the correct response is \"DONE\" right away. There's no need to move anywhere else. The available directions don't matter once the target is reached. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. The key point is that the initial position is the target. So regardless of the available exits, the answer should be DONE. Let me confirm by looking at the example again. Yes, when they entered the Bedroom, they stopped. So same logic applies here. \n\nTherefore, the next instruction is DONE.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740664038, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 533}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:47:17.761684", "call_duration": "0:00:34.788665", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
