Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The task is to give directions using \"GO: DIRECTION\" until they reach the target, then say \"DONE\". \n\nWait, the initial prompt says the target is the Basement, and the user is already in the Basement. The available directions are east, north, south. But since they're already in the target room, shouldn't the answer be \"DONE\" immediately? Let me check the example again. In the example, when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they responded with DONE. So here, starting in the Basement, which is the target, the correct response is DONE. Maybe the user made a typo, but according to the given info, the answer should be DONE.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740663852, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 192, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 424}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:44:11.951758", "call_duration": "0:00:13.943463", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
