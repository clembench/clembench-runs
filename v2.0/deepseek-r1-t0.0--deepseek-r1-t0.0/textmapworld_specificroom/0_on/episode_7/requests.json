Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Game room. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740664072-6WOiJu8PJ3ON4pDNUVar", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "DONE", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, so the user wants me to help them navigate through rooms to find the target room, which in this case is the Game room. The key here is to respond with either \"GO: direction\" or \"DONE\" once they're in the target room. \n\nLooking at the example provided, once the user enters the target room, the correct response is \"DONE\". Now, the current scenario says: \"You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\" \n\nWait, the target room is the Game room, and they're already there. So according to the example, the answer should be \"DONE\" immediately. But the available directions here include west. Does that mean they might have to check if they're in the correct room first?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the target room is the Game room, and the user is already in the Game room. So regardless of the available directions, since they're already in the target room, the correct response is \"DONE\". \n\nI need to make sure there's no confusion here. The initial position is the target room, so the task is completed immediately. The example shows that once you enter the Bedroom (the target in that case), you respond with DONE. So here, since the user starts in the Game room, which is the target, the answer is DONE right away. The available directions don't matter once you're in the target room. \n\nSo the answer should be \"DONE\" without any \"GO\" commands. That's straightforward. Just confirm that the current room is the target and respond accordingly.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740664072, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 567}, "provider": "Friendli", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:47:52.604027", "call_duration": "0:00:24.836093", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
