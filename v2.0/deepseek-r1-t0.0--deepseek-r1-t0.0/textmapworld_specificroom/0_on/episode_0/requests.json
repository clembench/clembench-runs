Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Bar. You are in the Bar. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "gen-1740663831-TdDX5xxvGypsteHsVCaE", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "DONE", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null, "reasoning": "Okay, so the user wants me to help them navigate through rooms to find the target room, which in this case is the Bar. The example they provided shows that once the target room is reached, the response should be \"DONE\". \n\nLooking at the current situation: the user is already in the Bar, which is the target room. The available direction is west, but since they're already where they need to be, the correct response here should be to stop. So the next instruction should be \"DONE\" instead of moving west.\n\nWait, but the example they gave had the user moving through rooms until they entered the Bedroom, then they said DONE. So in this case, since the starting room is the Bar, which is the target, the immediate answer is DONE. There's no need to move anywhere else. The available directions don't matter because the goal is already achieved. \n\nI need to make sure I follow the format exactly. The user specified that once the target is found, answer with DONE. So even though there's a direction available (west), since we're already in the Bar, the correct response is DONE. \n\nI think that's it. The key is to check if the current room is the target. If yes, DONE. If not, choose a direction. Here, the current room is the Bar, so DONE.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740663831, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 288, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 513}, "provider": "Friendli", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:43:50.835424", "call_duration": "0:00:21.085747", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
