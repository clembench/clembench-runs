Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Guest room. You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: south, north.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe task is to give directions using \"GO: DIRECTION\" until we reach the target room, then respond with \"DONE\". The example provided shows that once the target is reached, we just say DONE. \n\nLooking at the current situation: the user is already in the Guest room, which is the target. The available directions are south and north. But since the target is achieved, the correct response should be DONE immediately. Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. The initial message says \"You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: south, north. What is your next instruction?\" Since the target is the Guest room, even though there are directions available, the correct answer is DONE because we're already there. \n\nI need to make sure I don't overcomplicate this. The example shows that once you enter the target room, regardless of other exits, you just say DONE. So in this case, since the starting point is the Guest room (the target), the answer is DONE right away. No need to move anywhere else. \n\nBut wait, maybe the user made a typo? Let me check again. The target is Guest room, and the current room is Guest room. So yes, we're already there. Therefore, the correct response is DONE. No movement needed. The available directions don't matter once the target is reached. So the answer should be DONE.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740663968, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 563}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:46:07.848969", "call_duration": "0:00:34.153999", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
