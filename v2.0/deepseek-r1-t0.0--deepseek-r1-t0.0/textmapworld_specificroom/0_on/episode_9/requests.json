Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Dining room. You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: east, west.

The example they provided shows that once you're in the target room, you just respond with \"DONE\". \n\nLooking at the current situation: the user is already in the Dining room. The available directions are east and west. But since the target is the Dining room, they don't need to move anywhere else. So the correct response here should be \"DONE\" immediately.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check. The problem says that once the target room is found, answer with \"DONE\". Since the starting point is the Dining room, which is the target, there's no need to go anywhere. So the next instruction should definitely be \"DONE\". The available directions don't matter because the goal is already achieved. \n\nI think that's right. The example they gave had the user moving until they reached the Bedroom and then said \"DONE\". Here, they start in the target room, so no movement is needed. So the answer is DONE.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "eos"}], "created": 1740664105, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 232, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 461}, "provider": "Together", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:48:25.223912", "call_duration": "0:00:05.554064", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
