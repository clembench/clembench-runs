Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The example they provided shows that once you're in the target room, you just respond with \"DONE\". \n\nLooking at the current situation they gave: \"You are in the Studio. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\" Wait, but the target room is the Studio. So if they're already in the Studio, shouldn't the answer be \"DONE\" immediately? Because the goal is to find the target room, and they're already there.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if there's a trick here. The example they showed had the user moving through rooms until they entered the target room. In the starting scenario here, the user is already in the target room. So the correct response should be \"DONE\" right away. There's no need to move anywhere else. \n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem states that once the target room is found, answer with \"DONE\". Since the starting point is the Studio, which is the target, the answer is DONE. The available directions don't matter because the task is completed upon entering the target room. So the correct response here is definitely \"DONE\".\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740663938, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 501}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:45:38.048965", "call_duration": "0:00:29.742162", "response": "DONE", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}]
