Now we're back in the Guest room with directions south and north. Wait, that seems like a loop. Maybe I need to try a different path. From the Guest room, the available directions are south and north. We've already gone south before, which led to Sunroom. Maybe trying north this time? But the initial directions in the Guest room were south and north. If we go north now, maybe that's a new path. Let me check the previous steps. The first move was south from Guest to Sunroom. Then west to Mudroom, south to Cellar, back north to Mudroom, east to Sunroom, north back to Guest. So the Guest room's north direction hasn't been explored yet. Maybe going north from Guest room now could lead to a new area. Let's try that.
