The available directions from the Cellar are east and north. Let me think about possible room layouts. Maybe if I go north first, that could lead to another area. But sometimes in these problems, the Media room might be connected through a specific path. Alternatively, going east might be the right way. Wait, maybe I should try one direction and see where it leads. But since I can't actually move until I give the command, I have to make a best guess here. Let's say I choose north first. If the next room isn't the Media room, then I can adjust. But the user will provide the next step's info after each GO command. So for the first step, I have to pick either east or north. Hmm. Media rooms are sometimes in basements, but the starting point is the Cellar. Maybe the Media room is connected via east? Or maybe north leads to a hallway that connects to other rooms. Without more info, I'll have to pick one. Let's try east first. Wait, but the example in the problem had the target as Bedroom, and the user went west from Kitchen to Lobby, then north. So maybe the directions are arbitrary. I need to just pick a direction and then adjust based on the next input. Since the first step is from Cellar with east and north, I'll choose one. Let's go east first. So the first command would be GO: east. But wait, maybe the Media room is north. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Media room is connected via east. Hmm. I'll have to make a choice here.
