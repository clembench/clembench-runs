Alternatively, going south could be the right path. Wait, maybe I should try one direction and see where it takes me. Let's say I go south first. Then, in the next room, I'll check the available directions again. But the example showed that sometimes you have to backtrack. Hmm, but since the target is the Guest room, maybe it's connected via south. Or maybe north. Without knowing the map, it's a bit of a guess. Let me try north first. Wait, but maybe Guest room is commonly connected to a hallway or something. Alternatively, maybe south leads to a hallway with more options. I'm not sure. Let's pick one direction. Let's try south. So I'll say GO: south. Then, if the next room's directions are given, I can adjust accordingly. But the user will provide the next available directions after each move.
