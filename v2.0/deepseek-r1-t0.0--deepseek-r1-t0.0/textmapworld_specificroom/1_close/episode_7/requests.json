My job is to choose a direction each time until reaching the Pantry. \n\nIn the first step, from the Game room, west is the only option. So I should respond with GO: west. Then, depending on where that leads, the next available directions will be given. If the next room is the Pantry, then I answer DONE. Otherwise, choose another direction. But since the user is handling the simulation, I just need to pick directions each time based on the current info. So the first move is definitely west.
