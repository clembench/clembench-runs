Let's see. The user said that in each room, I have to choose a direction to go, and once I reach the target room, I should say DONE. The example they gave used directions like north, south, east, west, so I have to stick to those. \n\nRight now, the starting point is the Bar, and the available direction is west. So from the Bar, the only option is to go west. Let me go west first. \n\nWait, but I need to remember the path or at least keep track of where I might be going. Since the target is the Home office, maybe I should explore each direction methodically. But in this case, the Bar only has west as an available direction. So I have to go west. Let's do that.\n\nAfter moving west from the Bar, I'll enter a new room. Let's say that room has other directions. Suppose the next room has directions east (which would lead back to the Bar) and maybe another direction like north or south. But I don't know yet. The user will tell me the available directions once I move. \n\nSo my first move is definitely GO: west. Then, depending on the next available directions, I need to choose another path. But since the target is the Home office, maybe I need to check each possible path until I find it. \n\nWait, but how do I know when I've found the Home office? The user will tell me once I enter the room. So each time I move, the user will say \"You have made a step and entered a [Room Name].\" So once that room name is \"Home office,\" I should respond with DONE. \n\nSo the initial step is clear: from Bar, go west. Then, in the next step, whatever directions are available, I need to pick one that hasn't been explored yet, maybe. But since I don't have a map, I have to just follow the available directions and backtrack if necessary. \n\nBut since the user is handling the environment, I just need to respond with the direction each time based on the current room's available exits. So the first answer is definitely GO: west.\n"}, "native_finish_reason": "stop"}], "created": 1740664111, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 473, "prompt_tokens": 227, "total_tokens": 700}, "provider": "Nebius", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:48:30.838771", "call_duration": "0:00:52.109336", "response": "GO: west", "model_name": "deepseek-r1"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-27T13:49:22.948742", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "GO: west"}], "raw_response_obj": {"clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-27 13:49:22.948663", "call_duration": "0:00:00.000064", "response": "You have made a step and entered Home office.
