The available directions here are east, north, and south. Hmm, I should probably pick one direction and see where it leads. Let me think about common room layouts. Basements often have stairs leading up, maybe north or south could be stairs. Alternatively, east might lead to another room. Wait, maybe I should try north first. But I'm not sure. Let's say I go north. If that's not the Library, then I'll have to backtrack. Alternatively, maybe east? Or south? I need to keep track of the directions I've tried. Since the target is the Library, which is usually a more common room on upper floors, maybe going north or south to get to the stairs and then up. Wait, but the directions given are east, north, south. So maybe the Basement is connected to other rooms in those directions. Let me try north first. If I go north and it's not the Library, then I can check the available directions there and proceed. Alternatively, maybe east is a better choice. Hmm. Let's start with north.
