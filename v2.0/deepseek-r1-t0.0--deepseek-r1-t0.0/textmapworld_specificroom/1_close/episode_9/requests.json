The target is the Kitchen, and I'm starting in the Dining room. The available directions here are east and west. Let me think about possible room layouts.\n\nHmm, in many house layouts, the kitchen is often near the dining room. Maybe if I go west or east. Wait, but which direction leads to the kitchen? Let me recall the example given. In the example, the target was a Bedroom, and they moved west from the Kitchen to a Lobby, then north to the Bedroom. So directions can vary, but I need to make a choice here.\n\nIf I choose west first, maybe that leads to another room. But if the Kitchen is adjacent to the Dining room, perhaps one of these directions is directly to the Kitchen. Let me think: sometimes kitchens are connected to dining rooms via a south or north direction, but here the available directions are east and west. Wait, maybe the Kitchen is to the west. Or maybe east leads to another room, and then from there, another direction leads to the Kitchen.\n\nBut since the user hasn't given any prior steps, I have to choose between east and west. Let's assume that the Kitchen is directly west of the Dining room. So I should try west first. If that's the Kitchen, then I can respond with DONE. If not, then I'll have to backtrack. But since the example used west first, maybe the answer here is west. Alternatively, maybe east is the correct path. Wait, but the target is Kitchen. Let me think again. If I'm in the Dining room and directions are east and west, perhaps the Kitchen is to the west. Let's try that. So the first move would be GO: west. If that takes me to the Kitchen, then DONE. If not, then I need to adjust. But since the problem says once we find the target room, answer DONE. So the first step is to choose between east and west.

The target room is the Kitchen. I started in the Dining room and went west to the Pantry, but now the only available direction is east, which would take me back to the Dining room. Hmm, that's a dead end. So maybe I should backtrack. Wait, in the initial step, the Dining room had directions east and west. I went west to the Pantry, so the other direction was east. But if east from the Dining room wasn't explored yet, maybe I should go back and check that. But the current location is Pantry, and the only exit is east back to Dining. So I need to go east now. Then, once back in Dining, check the other direction, which was east. Let me confirm: the first move was west to Pantry, now I have to go back east to Dining, then from Dining, go east again if possible. Wait, the initial directions in Dining were east and west. So after returning to Dining, the available directions would still be east and west. But since I came from west (Pantry), the east direction might lead to another room. So next step is to go east from Dining. Let me make sure. The user's last message says I'm in Pantry with directions east. So I have to go east back to Dining. Then, from Dining, the available directions were east and west. Since west leads back to Pantry, which is a dead end, the correct path must be east from Dining. So after returning to Dining, the next move should be east. Therefore, the current step is to go east back to Dining, and then from there go east again. But the user is asking for the next instruction after entering Pantry. So the next instruction is GO: east. Then, once back in Dining, the available directions would be east and west again. Then I need to go east. But wait, maybe the Kitchen is east of Dining. Let me check the initial problem: target is Kitchen, starting in Dining room with directions east and west. So if I first went west to Pantry, then east back to Dining, then east again from Dining would lead to Kitchen. So the correct path is Dining -> west (Pantry), then east back to Dining, then east again to Kitchen. Therefore, after the current step (Pantry, east only), the next move is east back to Dining. Then, the next instruction would be east again. But the user is asking for the next instruction after entering Pantry. So the answer here is GO: east. Then, when back in Dining, directions are east and west again. Then the next move would be east. So the user's next instruction after Pantry is east, then when back in Dining, the next instruction is east again, which should be the Kitchen. Then answer DONE.
