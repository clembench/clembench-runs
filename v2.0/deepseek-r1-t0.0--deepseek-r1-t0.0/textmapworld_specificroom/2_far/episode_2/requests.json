The only available direction here is south. Since there's only one option, I should go south first. Let me see where that takes me.\n\nAfter moving south, I'll be in a new room. Let's say the next room has directions available. I need to keep track of the path so I don't get stuck in a loop. If the next room has multiple exits, maybe I should try north first to check if it's a dead end, but wait, north would take me back to the Conservatory. So maybe I should try other directions like east or west if available. But I need to remember that the goal is to find the Game room. If I hit a dead end, I'll backtrack.
