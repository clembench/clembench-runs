The goal is to put the book, plate, and mop on the table. \n\nFirst, the user started in the living room where the book was on the side table. They went to the kitchen, took the plate from the counter, and placed it on the table. Then they returned to the living room, took the book, went back to the kitchen, and put the book on the table. So the book and plate are already on the kitchen table.\n\nNext, they needed the mop. They went to the hallway, then the broom closet, took the mop, and now they're back in the hallway. The next step is to take the mop to the kitchen table. From the hallway, they can go to the kitchen. Once there, they can put the mop on the table. After that, all three items will be on the table, so they can end the game with \"done\".\n\nSo the action now should be to go to the kitchen from the hallway. Then put the mop on the table. Then check if all items are placed.
