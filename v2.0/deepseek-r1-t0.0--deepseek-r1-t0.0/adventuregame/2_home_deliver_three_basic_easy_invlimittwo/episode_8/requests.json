The user is playing a text adventure game and their goal is to place the pillow on the table, along with the book and plate. They've already moved the book and plate to the table in the living room. Now they need to get the pillow from the bedroom to the living room table.\n\nIn the current step, the user is in the hallway after taking the pillow from the bedroom. They need to go back to the living room. The correct action here is to \"go to living room\" to get back there. Once there, they can put the pillow on the table. Since the user's inventory has the pillow, the next logical step is to move to the living room and then place it on the table. The user might not realize they need to go back to the living room first, so guiding them there is essential.
