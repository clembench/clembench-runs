So far, they've managed to get the book and the plate onto the living room table, but the pillow is still missing. The user has been searching various locations: the living room couch, kitchen cupboard, pantry, and now the freezer in the pantry. The pillow wasn't found in any of those places. The next logical step is to check the hallway, which hasn't been explored yet. The user needs to move from the pantry back to the kitchen, then go to the hallway. Once in the hallway, they should look around for the pillow. If found, take it to the living room table. If not, maybe check other rooms connected to the hallway. The key is to systematically search each location until the pillow is located and placed on the table. The user should also make sure that once all items are on the table, they end the game with \"> done\".
