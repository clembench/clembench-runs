The user's first guess was \"imply\", which makes sense because \"imply\" means to suggest something indirectly. The system agreed that it's a valid guess based on the clue. Now, I need to think about possible feedback scenarios and how to proceed next.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any feedback yet. The initial guess was \"imply\", and the system just agreed that it's a good fit for the clue. So maybe the next step is to consider if \"imply\" is the correct answer or if there's another word that fits better. Since the feedback isn't given, perhaps the user is expecting another guess based on the same clue, but maybe refining it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system's agreement is just confirming that \"imply\" is a reasonable guess, but not necessarily the correct answer. So I should think of other 5-letter words that mean \"hint at\". Let's brainstorm: imply, allude, infer, suggest, evoke, refer. Wait, \"allude\" is 6 letters, so that's out. \"Infer\" is 5 letters, but it's more about concluding from evidence. \"Suggest\" is 7 letters. \"Evoke\" is 5, but means to bring to mind. \"Refer\" is 5, but to mention. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"allude\" is the actual answer, but it's 6 letters. So that's not possible. Another option: \"point\" as in \"point to\", but that's 5 letters. \"Hint\" itself is 4 letters. \"Clue\" is 4. Maybe \"tease\" as in teasing information? Or \"evoke\"? Not sure. Let me check synonyms for \"hint at\". Thesaurus says: suggest, imply, indicate, insinuate, intimate. \"Insinuate\" is 9 letters. \"Intimate\" is 8. So \"imply\" and \"suggest\" are the main ones, but \"suggest\" is too long. So \"imply\" is the best fit. But maybe the answer is \"allude\" but that's 6 letters. Wait, no, the target word is 5 letters. So \"imply\" is correct? But the user hasn't confirmed yet. Since the system agreed, maybe \"imply\" is correct, but perhaps the feedback would show some letters are wrong. But since there's no feedback yet, maybe the user is expecting another guess.
