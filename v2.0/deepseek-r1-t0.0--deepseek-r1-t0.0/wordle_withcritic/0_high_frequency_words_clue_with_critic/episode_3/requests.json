You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

Hmm, a calendar page usually has dates, months, days... Maybe the word is related to parts of a calendar. The target word is five letters. Let me think of common five-letter words associated with calendars. \n\n\"Month\" is five letters, but that's the whole month, not a page. \"Week\" is four letters. \"Daily\" is five, but a calendar page could be a day. Wait, \"daily\" is five letters, but maybe \"diary\"? No, that's more of a journal. \n\nAnother angle: a calendar page might have a specific term. Like \"month\" again, but maybe \"agenda\"? No, that's six letters. \"Sheet\" is five letters, but that's more general. \n\nWait, \"leaf\" is sometimes used to refer to a page in a book or calendar. Like \"turn over a new leaf\". So \"leaf\" is four letters. Not enough. \n\nWhat about \"plate\"? No, that's not related. Maybe \"paged\"? No, that's past tense. \n\nWait, \"calend\" is part of the word calendar, but the target is five letters. Maybe \"month\" again. Or \"dates\"? Dates are on calendar pages. \"Dates\" is five letters. Let me check: D-A-T-E-S. Yes, five letters. So the clue \"calendar page\" could refer to the dates listed on a page. So the guess would be \"dates\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"daily\" as in a daily page. But \"daily\" is more about frequency. \"Dates\" seems more directly related to the content of a calendar page.
