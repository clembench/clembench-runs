The user provided the clue \"tv show since 1/14/52\" and my first guess was \"today\", which they agreed with because \"The Today Show\" started on that date.

Let me think.\n\nWait, the feedback after a guess would come into play here, but the user hasn't provided any feedback yet. They just agreed that \"today\" fits the clue. However, in Wordle, sometimes the answer could be a synonym or a related term. Let me check if there's another TV show that started on that date. But I'm pretty sure \"The Today Show\" is the correct association here. Maybe the answer is indeed \"today\". But since the user is continuing the game, perhaps the initial guess wasn't correct, and they need another attempt. Wait, the user's message includes \"clue: tv show since 1/14/52\" again, followed by guess_agreement: yes. So they confirmed that \"today\" is correct in terms of the clue, but maybe in the actual game, the feedback would show some letters are incorrect. But since the user hasn't given feedback yet, perhaps they're expecting me to stick with \"today\" as the first guess. However, the initial instruction said that agreeing doesn't confirm correctness. So maybe I need to consider other possibilities. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"today\" but the feedback will come next. Since the user hasn't provided feedback, perhaps I should proceed with the next guess based on the clue and agreement. Wait, the user's response after my first guess was to agree that \"today\" matches the clue, but in the actual Wordle game, the feedback would indicate which letters are correct. Since there's no feedback yet, maybe the user is expecting me to confirm the guess again or consider another angle. Alternatively, maybe the answer is a different show. Let me double-check the date. January 14, 1952 – yes, that's definitely the premiere of The Today Show. So \"today\" is the most logical answer. Unless there's another show on the same date, but I can't think of any. So perhaps the correct answer is \"today\", and the user is confirming that the clue matches, so the next step would be to stick with \"today\" as the guess. But since the user hasn't provided feedback, maybe they want me to proceed to the next guess. Wait, the initial instruction says that after each guess, feedback is given. But in this case, the user hasn't given feedback yet. Maybe this is the first guess, and the user is just confirming that the clue matches \"today\", but the actual answer might be different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \"today\", and the user is moving to the next step. But according to the example, after the first guess, feedback is provided. Since the user hasn't given feedback, perhaps they're expecting me to make the first guess, which I already did.
