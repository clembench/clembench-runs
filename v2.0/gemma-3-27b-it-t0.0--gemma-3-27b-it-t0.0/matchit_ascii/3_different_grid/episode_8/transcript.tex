	 ANSWER: No, my triangle of 'X's does *not* extend to include the entire bottom row. There is one empty square along the bottom row within the triangle's area.\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: In your grid, are the 'X's arranged in a way that forms a perfect rectangle across the first four rows, or is there any irregularity in the shape created by the 'X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
