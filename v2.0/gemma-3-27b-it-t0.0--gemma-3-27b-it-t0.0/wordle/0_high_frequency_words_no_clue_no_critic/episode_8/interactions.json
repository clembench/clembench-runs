You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:07:39.875556", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word containing many vowels to get a feel for the letters in the target word.\nguess: adieu"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:07:39.875670", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = never\nguess = adieu\nguess_feedback = a<red> d<red> i<red> e<green> u<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:07:39.875744", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> d<red> i<red> e<green> u<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:07:46.347715", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates 'e' is in the correct position.
