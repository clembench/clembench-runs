This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:22:06.543698", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common word containing many vowels to get a feel for the letters in the target word.\nguess: adieu"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:22:06.543813", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = tubal\nguess = adieu\nguess_feedback = a<yellow> d<red> i<red> e<red> u<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:22:06.543894", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> d<red> i<red> e<red> u<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-03-17T17:22:17.388092", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates 'a' and 'u' are in the word, but not in their current positions.
