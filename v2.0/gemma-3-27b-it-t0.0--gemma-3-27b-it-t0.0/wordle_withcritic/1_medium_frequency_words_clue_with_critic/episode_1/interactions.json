You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

I overlooked the negative constraints from the previous feedback and strayed too far from a direct interpretation of \"behold!\". I need to focus on words related to seeing, using only the letters not previously eliminated, and incorporating 'l' and 'a' in new positions. \"claim\" fits this criteria – it suggests something being brought to attention or observed."}, "guess_changed_after_critic_response": true}, "3": {"before_critic": {"guess": "trail", "explanation": "The feedback shows 'l', 'a', and 'i' are in the word, but in the wrong positions. 'c' and 'm' are not in the word. Considering the clue \"behold!\" and these constraints, I need a five-letter word with 'l', 'a', and 'i' in different spots. \"trail\" seems plausible, as a trail is something one might behold or follow with their eyes."}, "critic_response": {"agreement": "yes", "explanation": "the clue \"behold!\" suggests something visually striking or noticeable. a \"trail\" can certainly be something one beholds, and the letters align with the feedback provided – 'l', 'a', and 'i' are present but in incorrect positions, and 'c' and 'm' are absent."}, "after_critic": {"guess": "valid", "explanation": "My apologies. I failed to verify \"arial\" as a valid five-letter word. I need to rethink, keeping 'l', 'a', 'i' in mind, and the previously eliminated letters.
