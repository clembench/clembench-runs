Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: dash<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: The clue \"dash\" suggests speed or a quick movement. A common word associated with quick movement and having five letters is \"swift\".\nguess: swift<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nclue: dash\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the clue \"dash\" refers to a quick movement, and \"swift\" aligns with that meaning while being a five-letter word. the explanation logically connects the clue to the guess.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: Since \"swift\" was agreed upon as a reasonable starting guess based on the clue \"dash\", and no feedback has been given yet, I will proceed with a new guess aiming to explore more common vowels and consonants. Considering words related to speed, \"hurry\" seems fitting.\nguess: hurry<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: h<red> u<red> r<green> r<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: The feedback indicates 'r' is correct and in the right position. All other letters (h, u, r, y) are incorrect. Knowing 'r' is the third letter, and considering the clue \"dash\", I'll try a word with 'r' in that position and explore different vowel combinations. \"crank\" fits this criteria and relates to quick, forceful movements.\nguess: crank<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nclue: dash\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the previous guess 'swift' had 'r' in the correct position according to the feedback. 'crank' also has 'r' in the correct position and the clue 'dash' can relate to a forceful, quick action like turning a crank. the explanation considers the feedback and the clue.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: We know 'r' is the third letter and h, u, r, y, c, a, n, k are not in the correct positions (or at all). Considering the clue \"dash\" and needing to fill the remaining spots, I'll try \"prank\" as it maintains the 'r' in the third position and relates to a quick, mischievous action.\nguess: prank<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: The feedback shows 'r' is present but in the wrong position. All other letters (p, a, n, k) are incorrect. Since 'r' is not the third letter, and we need a five-letter word relating to \"dash\", I'll try \"brisk\" which uses 'r' and fits the clue's meaning of quickness.\nguess: brisk<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nclue: dash\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the feedback from 'crank' indicates 'r' is present but in the wrong position. 'brisk' uses 'r' and aligns with the clue 'dash' as both relate to quickness. the explanation considers the previous feedback and the clue.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: We know 'r' is in the word, but not in the 2nd or 3rd position. p, a, n, k, h, u are not in the word. \"brisk\" was accepted. I will try to reposition the 'r' and explore new letters. Considering the clue \"dash\", \"sharp\" seems like a good option.\nguess: sharp<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> a<red> r<yellow> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: The feedback indicates 'r' is in the word but not in the fourth position. s, h, a, and p are not in the word.

Considering the clue \"dash\", and the letters we've tried, I'll try \"tarry\" as it suggests delaying a dash, and uses 'r'.\nguess: tarry<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> r<green> r<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nexplanation: The feedback shows 'r' is correct and in the third position. t, a, r, y are incorrect.
