Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: There are no specific rules or constraints that dictate how the 'X' and '▢' characters are arranged within the grid. They are simply arranged as described: 'X' on the outer edges and '▢' in the center.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-18 04:53:22.105044", "call_duration": "0:00:00.661720", "response": "DECISION: same grid", "model_name": "Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct"}}}]
