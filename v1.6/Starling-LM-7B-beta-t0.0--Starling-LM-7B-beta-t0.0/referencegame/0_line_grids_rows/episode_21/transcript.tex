	 Answer: The expression refers to the Third grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt Explanation: In the Third grid, the bottom row consists entirely of empty cells (▢), while the other rows have a mix of filled (X) and empty cells. This matches the unique pattern described in the expression. In contrast, the First grid has a bottom row filled with "X", and the Second grid starts with empty cells in the bottom row, which does not match the expression.
