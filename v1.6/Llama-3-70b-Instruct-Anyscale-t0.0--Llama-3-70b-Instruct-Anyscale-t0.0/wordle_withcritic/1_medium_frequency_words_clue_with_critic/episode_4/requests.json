Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:square\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:block\nexplanation:A square is a type of block shape, and the word \"block\" has 5 letters, fitting the given criteria.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "clue:square\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:the explanation provided is reasonable, as a square can be considered a type of block shape, and the word \"block\" indeed has 5 letters, making it a possible match for the clue.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:frame\nexplanation:Since the clue \"square\" is related to a shape, and the agreement with \"block\" suggests that shape-related words are on the right track, I'm guessing \"frame\", which is a word that can be associated with a square shape, and it also has 5 letters.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> r<yellow> a<red> m<red> e<yellow>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "guess:flare\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I see that \"r\" and \"e\" are present in the correct word, but not in the correct positions.
