        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:dessert bean<br/></p>

        <p>What a delightful clue!<br/><br/>guess: mocha<br/>explanation: The clue &quot;dessert bean&quot; makes me think of coffee, which is a popular dessert drink. Mocha is a type of coffee drink that comes to mind, and it has 5 letters. Additionally, coffee beans are a key ingredient in mocha, which fits nicely with the &quot;bean&quot; part of the clue.<br/><br/>Please provide the feedback for my guess!</p>

        <p>guess: cocoa<br/>explanation: The feedback indicates that &quot;o&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are in the word, but not in the correct position. The clue &quot;dessert bean&quot; still points me towards a sweet treat, and cocoa is a type of dessert that is often associated with beans (cacao beans). The presence of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in the feedback makes me think that cocoa could be a good fit.</p>
