        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:sassy<br/></p>

        <p>What a delightful clue!<br/><br/>guess: spunk<br/>explanation: The clue &quot;sassy&quot; makes me think of a word that conveys a sense of confidence and attitude. &quot;Spunk&quot; is a word that fits this description, and it has 5 letters. I&#x27;m hoping that the word starts with &quot;S&quot; since it&#x27;s a common letter in many sassy-related words.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s see how my guess fares!</p>

The clue &quot;sassy&quot; makes me think that the word might be related to &quot;sassy&quot; itself. I&#x27;m going to take a chance and try &quot;sassY&quot;, which is a common suffix in many words related to attitude and confidence. The &quot;Y&quot; at the end is a hunch, but it could fit the sassy vibe.</p>
