You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-01T13:27:21.954230", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Okay, I'm ready to play!\n\n**guess:** crane\n\n**explanation:**\n\nI'm starting with \"crane\" because it's a word that contains a good mix of common vowels and consonants, including the frequently used letters \"a\", \"e\", and \"r\".
