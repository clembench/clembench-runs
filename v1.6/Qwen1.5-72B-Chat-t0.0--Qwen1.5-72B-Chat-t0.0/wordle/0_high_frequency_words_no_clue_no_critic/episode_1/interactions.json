You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:21.427521", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: I'm starting with \"crane\" as it's a common five-letter word and the first letter \"c\" is a frequently occurring consonant in English words."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:21.427571", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "I'm starting with \"crane\" as it's a common five-letter word and the first letter \"c\" is a frequently occurring consonant in English words."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:21.427755", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = share\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<green> n<red> e<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "share", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Qwen1.5-72B-Chat)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "I'm starting with \"crane\" as it's a common five-letter word and the first letter \"c\" is a frequently occurring consonant in English words.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:23.556035", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<green> n<red> e<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:23.556287", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Based on the feedback, we know:\n1. \"a\" is in the correct position.\n2. \"e\" is also in the correct position.\n3. \"r\" is in the word but in the wrong position.\n4. \"c\" and \"n\" are not part of the word.\n\nConsidering these clues, I'll make my next guess with a word that has \"a\" and \"e\" in the same positions and \"r\" somewhere else.\n\nguess: steak\nex"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:23.556314", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "steak", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:23.556431", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = share\nguess: steak\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<red> e<yellow> a<yellow> k<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "share", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Qwen1.5-72B-Chat)", "guess": "steak", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:25.807616", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<green> t<red> e<yellow> a<yellow> k<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-05-09T15:09:25.807883", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:grape\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, \"s\" is correct and in the correct position, \"e\" is correct but in the wrong position, and \"a\" also appears but in the wrong position.
