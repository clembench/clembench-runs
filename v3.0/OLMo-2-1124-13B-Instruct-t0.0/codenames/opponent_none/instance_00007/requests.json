The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: bond, tie, moon, string, czech, row, casino, concert, link.\nYour opponent's team words are: bark, beat, platypus, pyramid, hotel, alien, robin, centaur.\nDistractor words are: pass, belt, leprechaun, star, eye, tag, mug.\nThe kill words are: ninja.\n<|assistant|>\n",
