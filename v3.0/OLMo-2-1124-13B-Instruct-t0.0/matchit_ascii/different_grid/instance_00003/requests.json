Specifically, the second row has two X's and three ▢'s, the third row has three X's and two ▢'s, and the fourth row has one X and four ▢'s. The second column has two X's and three ▢'s, the third column has three X's and two ▢'s, and the fifth column has one X and four ▢'s.\nQUESTION: Is the first column entirely filled with 'X' marks?
