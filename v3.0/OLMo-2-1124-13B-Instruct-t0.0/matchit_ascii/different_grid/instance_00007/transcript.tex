	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have any rows where the 'X's are symmetrically placed around the center of the row.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
