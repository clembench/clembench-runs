The top row and the bottom row are entirely filled with Xs. The second row from the top has three filled squares and two empty squares, with the third square being an X. The third row from the top has two filled squares in the middle and is empty on the sides, with the second square being an X. The fourth row is identical to the second row, mirroring it.
