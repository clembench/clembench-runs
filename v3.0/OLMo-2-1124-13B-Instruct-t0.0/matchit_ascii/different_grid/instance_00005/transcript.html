        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 5x5 arrangement of cells. The cells are either empty (represented by ▢) or filled with an &#x27;X&#x27;. The pattern of &#x27;X&#x27;s forms a cross shape, with &#x27;X&#x27;s occupying the center cell and extending outward in four cardinal directions, touching the edges of the grid. The specific arrangement is as follows:<br/><br/>- Center cell: X<br/>- Directly above center: ▢<br/>- Directly below center: X<br/>- Directly to the left of center: X<br/>- Directly to the right of center: X<br/><br/>The surrounding cells are filled as follows:<br/><br/>- Top row: ▢ X X X X<br/>- Second row: X ▢ X X X<br/>- Third row: X X ▢ X X<br/>- Fourth row: X X X ▢ X<br/>- Bottom row: X X X X ▢<br/><br/>This configuration creates a symmetrical cross pattern within the 5x5 grid.</p>
