Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that have more than one 'X' and are not the first or last row?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: No, in my grid, the first and last rows are the only ones with more than one 'X', each having exactly two 'X's. The second, third, and fourth rows each have only one 'X'.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any rows with no 'X's at all?

Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are the '▢'s in your grid distributed such that there are two '▢'s in the first and fifth columns?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: No, the '▢'s in my grid are not distributed with two '▢'s in the first and fifth columns. The first and fifth columns each have one '▢'. The distribution of '▢'s is as follows: the first and last rows each have one '▢' in the first and fifth columns, respectively, while the second, third, and fourth rows have '▢'s positioned differently, not aligning with the first and fifth columns.\nQUESTION: Are there any 'X's in the second and fourth columns of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: Yes, there are 'X's in both the second and fourth columns of my grid. Specifically, the second column has 'X's in the second and third rows, and the fourth column has 'X's in the first and third rows.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow come to a decision.
