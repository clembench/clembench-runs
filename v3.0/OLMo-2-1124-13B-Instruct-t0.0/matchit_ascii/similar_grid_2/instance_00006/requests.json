The second row has one filled square followed by three empty ones and another filled square. The third row has two filled squares, then two empty ones, and finally two more filled squares. The fourth row is entirely filled with five squares. The fifth and last row has three filled squares followed by two empty ones.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 5x5 matrix. The first row and the first column are entirely filled with empty squares (▢). The second row has three filled squares (X) in the middle, and the third row has two filled squares (X) in the middle as well. The fourth row mirrors the second row with three filled squares (X) in the middle, and the fifth row is identical to the first row, being entirely filled with empty squares (▢).\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

In my grid, the second row has a pattern of X _ X _ X, and the fourth row is entirely filled with X's (X X X X X), which does not align to create a cross shape when compared directly.\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that are identical to each other, excluding the first and last rows which are already known to be identical in both grids?
