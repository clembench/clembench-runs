The first row has one filled square and four empty ones, denoted by ▢ X X X ▢. The second row has two filled squares and three empty ones, represented as ▢ ▢ X X ▢. The third row contains one filled square and two empty ones, marked as ▢ X ▢ X ▢. The fourth row has two filled squares and three empty ones, shown as ▢ X X ▢ ▢.
