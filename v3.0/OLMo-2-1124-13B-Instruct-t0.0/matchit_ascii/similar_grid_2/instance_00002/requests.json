The second row has two Xs in the first and third positions, with the second and fourth positions filled with ▢s, and the fifth position is an X. The third row is completely filled with Xs. The fourth row mirrors the first row, with Xs in the first, third, and fifth positions, and ▢s in the second and fourth positions. The fifth row has Xs in the first, third, and fifth positions, with ▢s in the second and fourth positions.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 6x6 matrix. The pattern is as follows: the first and third rows, as well as the second and fourth rows, are identical. Each of these rows contains two 'X's followed by a blank space ('▢'), another 'X', another blank space ('▢'), and finally two more 'X's. The fifth and sixth rows are also identical to each other and contain three 'X's followed by a blank space ('▢'), another 'X', and a final blank space ('▢'). There are no 'X's in the second column.\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that contain three consecutive 'X's?<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nANSWER: No, there are no rows in my grid that contain three consecutive 'X's.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any rows where the first and last positions are filled with 'X's, with a '▢' in the middle? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.\n<|assistant|>\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the first and last positions are filled with 'X's, with a '▢' in the middle. Specifically, the first, third, and fifth rows, as well as the fourth and sixth rows, follow this pattern.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
