	 ANSWER: Yes, the filled squares in the first and fifth rows of your grid are in the same columns as the filled squares in the first and fifth rows of my grid. Both grids have identical patterns for the first and fifth rows, with filled squares in the same positions relative to the empty squares. This consistency confirms that the filled squares in these specific rows are indeed in the same columns in both grids.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
