The pattern of 'X's forms a cross shape, with 'X's occupying the center cell and extending outward in four cardinal directions, touching the edges of the grid. The specific arrangement is as follows:\n\n- Center cell: X\n- Directly above center: ▢\n- Directly below center: X\n- Directly to the left of center: X\n- Directly to the right of center: X\n\nThe surrounding cells are filled as follows:\n\n- Top row: ▢ X X X X\n- Second row: X ▢ X X X\n- Third row: X X ▢ X X\n- Fourth row: X X X ▢ X\n- Bottom row: X X X X ▢\n\nThis configuration creates a symmetrical cross pattern within the 5x5 grid.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 5x5 pattern where the majority of the cells are filled with Xs, indicating a cross or a filled square. There are four cells that are filled with a circle (▢), which represent empty or different squares compared to the Xs. The pattern is symmetrical along the vertical axis, with two ▢s on each side of the center column. The top row has three Xs and two ▢s, the second row has three Xs and one ▢, the third row has two Xs and two ▢s, the fourth row has one X and four ▢s, and the bottom row is entirely filled with ▢s.\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
