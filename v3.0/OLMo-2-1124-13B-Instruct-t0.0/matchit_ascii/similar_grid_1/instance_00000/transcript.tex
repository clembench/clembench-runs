	 DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 5x5 arrangement of cells. The cells are either empty (represented by ▢) or filled with an 'X'. The pattern of 'X's forms a cross shape, with 'X's occupying the center cell and extending outward in four cardinal directions, touching the edges of the grid. The specific arrangement is as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Center cell: X\\ \tt - Directly above center: ▢\\ \tt - Directly below center: X\\ \tt - Directly to the left of center: X\\ \tt - Directly to the right of center: X\\ \tt \\ \tt The surrounding cells are filled as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Top row: ▢ X X X X\\ \tt - Second row: X ▢ X X X\\ \tt - Third row: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt - Fourth row: X X X ▢ X\\ \tt - Bottom row: X X X X ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt This configuration creates a symmetrical cross pattern within the 5x5 grid.
