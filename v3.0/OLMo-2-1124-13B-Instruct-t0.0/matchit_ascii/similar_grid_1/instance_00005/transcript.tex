	 ANSWER: No, the filled squares in the second and fourth rows are not horizontally aligned in both grids. In your grid, the second row has filled squares in the first and third positions (X▢▢▢▢), and the fourth row mirrors this with filled squares in the first and third positions (X▢▢▢▢). In my grid, the second row has filled squares in the first and second positions (X▢), and the fourth row mirrors the first row's pattern with filled squares in the first and fourth positions (▢X▢).\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
