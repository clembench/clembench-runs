	 ANSWER: No, the positions of the filled squares in the first and fifth rows are not the same in both grids. In my grid, the first row has filled squares in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th positions, while the fifth row has filled squares in the 2nd and 4th positions. In your grid, the first row also has filled squares in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th positions, but the fifth row has filled squares in the 2nd and 3rd positions. This difference confirms that the grids are not identical.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
