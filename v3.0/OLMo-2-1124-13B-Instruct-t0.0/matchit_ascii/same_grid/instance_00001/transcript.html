        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns, making it a 5x5 grid. The top and bottom rows are fully filled with Xs, indicating no empty spaces. The second row from the top has one filled ▢ (which could represent a different symbol or color) and three Xs. The third row mirrors the second row, with one ▢ and three Xs. The fourth row is identical to the second and third rows, containing one ▢ and three Xs. The fifth and final row is completely filled with Xs, similar to the first and last rows. This pattern suggests a symmetrical arrangement with a central distinctive symbol (▢) surrounded by Xs.</p>
