	 ANSWER: No, there is no irregularity or deviation from the perfect square shape of the grid. It maintains a standard 5x5 layout without any missing corners, edges, or distortion.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
