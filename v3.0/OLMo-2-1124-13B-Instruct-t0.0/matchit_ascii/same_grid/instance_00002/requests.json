Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X X X X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X\n<|assistant|>\nDESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 6x6 matrix. The pattern is as follows: the first and third rows, as well as the second and fourth rows, are identical. Each of these rows contains two 'X's followed by a blank space ('▢'), another 'X', another blank space ('▢'), and finally two more 'X's. The fifth and sixth rows are also identical to each other and contain three 'X's followed by a blank space ('▢'), another 'X', and a final blank space ('▢'). There are no 'X's in the second column.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 6x6 matrix.
