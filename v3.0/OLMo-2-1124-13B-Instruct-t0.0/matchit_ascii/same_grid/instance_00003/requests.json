The pattern is such that the first and last rows, as well as the first and last columns, contain exactly one 'X' each, with the rest of the cells filled with '▢'. The 'X' marks are positioned symmetrically across the grid diagonally from top-left to bottom-right.<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of a 4x4 arrangement of cells.
