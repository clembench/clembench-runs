The band Heart released several hits in 1985, but one of their most iconic songs from that year is \"What About Love.\" This song has five letters.\nguess: love\n\nguess_feedback: l<green> o<green> v<yellow> e<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'l' and 'o' are correct and in the right positions, while 'v' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'e' is incorrect. Considering the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\" and the feedback, the next guess should focus on adjusting the letter 'v' which is likely in the wrong spot. The word \"love\" fits the criteria but doesn't match the feedback perfectly, suggesting a slight modification is needed. Given the clue and the positions of the letters, \"ovale\" seems like a logical next guess, considering \"oval\" shapes which could be associated with \"hit\" in a metaphorical sense, and it fits the letter placement feedback better.\n\nguess: ovale\n\nguess_feedback: o<green> v<green> a<yellow> l<red> e<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback for \"ovale\" shows that 'o' and 'v' are correct and in the right positions, 'a' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'l' and 'e' are incorrect.
