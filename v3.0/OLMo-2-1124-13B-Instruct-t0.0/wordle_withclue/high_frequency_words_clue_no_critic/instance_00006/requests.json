Considering popular TV shows, \"The Simpsons\" comes to mind, where Homer Simpson is the father. The word \"dad\" fits the five-letter requirement.\nguess: dad\n\nguess_feedback: d<green> a<yellow> d<green> _<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'd' and 'a' are correct letters, but 'd' appears twice, so only one 'd' is in the correct position. The underscore '_' represents a letter that hasn't been guessed yet. The clue \"tv's ___dad\" suggests a specific TV show, and since \"dad\" is a common word, it's likely that the missing letter is from the show's name. \"The Simpsons\" is a well-known TV show featuring a character whose name ends in 'Homer'. Therefore, the next guess should incorporate this information.\n\nnext_guess: homer<|endoftext|>",
