	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like venture capital investments

	 explanation: The clue "like venture capital investments" suggests something that is risky yet potentially rewarding, often involving innovation and growth. The term "venture capital" itself is associated with startups and new business ventures. Among five-letter words related to finance and risk-taking, "stock" fits well as it represents a share in a company, which is a common investment in venture capital.\\ \tt guess: stock\\ \tt \\ \tt guess_feedback: s<green> t<green> o<green> c<green> k<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: The feedback indicates that "stock" is almost correct. The letters 's', 't', 'o', and 'c' are all in the correct position, while 'k' is not part of the target word. This suggests that the target word might be a synonym or related to "stock" in the context of investments, possibly without the 'k'. Considering the clue's emphasis on venture capital and the financial nature of "stock," a logical next guess would be "stocky," which is related to growth and solidity, often metaphorically used in financial contexts to describe a company's or investment's strength. However, "stocky" is not a five-letter word, so we need to consider other financial terms without the 'k'. "Bonds" is a common investment type and fits the criteria of a five-letter word related to finance and risk-taking.
