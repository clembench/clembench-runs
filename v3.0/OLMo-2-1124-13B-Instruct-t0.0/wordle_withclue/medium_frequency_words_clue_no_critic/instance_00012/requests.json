The term \"venture capital\" itself is associated with startups and new business ventures. Among five-letter words related to finance and risk-taking, \"stock\" fits well as it represents a share in a company, which is a common investment in venture capital.\nguess: stock\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> t<green> o<green> c<green> k<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"stock\" is almost correct. The letters 's', 't', 'o', and 'c' are all in the correct position, while 'k' is not part of the target word. This suggests that the target word might be a synonym or related to \"stock\" in the context of investments, possibly without the 'k'. Considering the clue's emphasis on venture capital and the financial nature of \"stock,\" a logical next guess would be \"stocky,\" which is related to growth and solidity, often metaphorically used in financial contexts to describe a company's or investment's strength. However, \"stocky\" is not a five-letter word, so we need to consider other financial terms without the 'k'. \"Bonds\" is a common investment type and fits the criteria of a five-letter word related to finance and risk-taking.<|endoftext|>",
