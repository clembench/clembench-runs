	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: barely noticeable

	 explanation: The clue "barely noticeable" suggests a word that is almost imperceptible or faint. This could imply a word with letters that are not very common or vowels that are subtle in their presence. The word should be short, as something barely noticeable wouldn't be long or complex. Considering the frequency of letters in English, I'll start with a word that includes vowels and less common consonants.\\ \tt guess: faint\\ \tt \\ \tt guess_feedback: f<yellow> a<yellow> i<green> n<yellow> t<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: The feedback indicates that 'i' is correct and in the right position, which supports the idea that the word includes a vowel that is not overly common. The presence of 'a' and 'n' in yellow suggests they are in the word but not in their current positions. The absence of 't' confirms it's not part of the word. Given the clue's emphasis on "barely noticeable," I'll focus on words that are subtle and possibly related to senses or concepts that are hard to detect. Considering the remaining letters and the clue, I'll adjust my guess to include 'e' which is a subtle vowel and often associated with subtlety or faintness.\\ \tt \\ \tt next_guess: fainter
