Common words associated with annoyance often include short, sharp sounds or letters, like \"t\" and \"c\". The word \"tick\" itself is a short, sharp sound and has five letters.\nguess: tickto\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> i<green> c<green> k<green> o<red> f<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"t\", \"i\", \"c\", and \"k\" are correct letters in the target word. The presence of \"o\" and \"f\" in \"tickto\" being marked as incorrect suggests that the target word does not contain these letters. Considering the clue \"tick off\" and the letters confirmed to be correct, the next guess should focus on rearranging these letters to form a valid English word. The word \"tick\" is a standalone word and fits the criteria of being a five-letter word related to the clue's theme of irritation or annoyance. Therefore, the next guess should be a permutation of \"tick\".\n\nnew_guess: tick\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> i<green> c<green> k<green>\n\nexplanation: The feedback confirms that \"tick\" is the correct word. The letters \"t\", \"i\", \"c\", and \"k\" are all in the right positions, indicating that \"tick\" is the target word. The clue \"tick off\"",
