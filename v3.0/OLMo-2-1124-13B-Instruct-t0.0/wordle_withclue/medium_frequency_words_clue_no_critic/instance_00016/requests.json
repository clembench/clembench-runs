The word \"shrewd\" itself has five letters, which fits the word length requirement. The letters 's', 'h', 'r', 'e', and 'd' are present in \"shrewd\". Given the clue's connotation, I'll consider words that might be associated with intelligence or cunning, which often include common letters like 'e', 'r', and 'd'.\nguess: clever\n\nguess_feedback: c<yellow> l<yellow> e<green> v<yellow> e<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'c', 'l', and 'e' are correct but in the wrong positions, while 'v' is incorrect. The presence of 'e' in both \"shrewd\" and \"clever\" suggests it's a likely letter in the target word. The clue \"shrewd\" hints at a word with a connotation of intelligence, and \"clever\" fits this theme. The letters 'r' and 'd' from \"shrewd\" are not present in \"clever,\" so they should be excluded from the next guess. The correct placement of 'e' and the presence of 'l' and 'c' in the feedback suggest focusing on these letters for the next guess.<|endoftext|>",
