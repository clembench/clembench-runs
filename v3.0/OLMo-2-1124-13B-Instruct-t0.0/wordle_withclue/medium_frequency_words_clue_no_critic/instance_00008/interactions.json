You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: make current",

Words like \"update\" or \"modernize\" come to mind, but they are longer than five letters. Considering common words related to making something current, \"flow\" fits as it can relate to the flow of information or time, which keeps things current.\nguess: flow\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> l<green> o<green> w<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'f', 'l', and 'o' are correct and in the right positions, while 'w' is incorrect. The clue \"make current\" suggests something that is ongoing or continuous, which aligns with the concept of \"flow.\" The presence of 'f', 'l', and 'o' in \"flow\" confirms that this guess is on the right track. Since \"flow\" is a strong candidate and only one letter needs adjustment, the next guess should focus on replacing 'w' with a letter that fits the context of \"make current.\" Considering words related to current and flow, \"flow\" seems to be the most fitting word given the clue and feedback. Therefore, no immediate change to the guess is necessary based on the current information. \n\nSince \"flow\" is a strong candidate and only one letter needs adjustment, and considering the clue and the feedback, the next guess will be the same:\n\nguess: flow",
