        "response": "My apologies for the confusion. Given the unique commands provided in the game (iscad, eriat, ovesis, mingne, setral, lepht), it seems we should stick to those for consistency. Let's try a different approach with the commands provided:\n\nSince the strood is now aphistic and the inchan is ailly, we might need to focus on the other objects to achieve the goal of making the strood aphistic, the aciong dolam, and the swaiced ailly.\n\nGiven the peculiar commands, let's try a different action with one of the other objects:\n\n> eriat aciong\n\nIf this doesn't yield the desired result, we can try another command with a different object.",
