Here's how you might proceed:\n\n> interact with the rabish\n\nThis could mean trying to pick up the rabish, examine it more closely, or use it in some way to achieve your goal.\n\n> seash the hypner\n\nThis could be a typo for \"search\" the hypner, meaning to look for items or clues within or around the hypner.\n\n> lotis the arger\n\nThis could be a typo for \"loot\" the arger, meaning to take items from the arger.\n\n> belity the prolly\n\nThis could be a typo for \"belly\" the prolly, meaning to examine the prolly's belly or interact with it in some way.\n\n> irear towards the proark\n\nThis could be a typo for \"near\" the proark, meaning to move closer to the proark.\n\n> deint the acion\n\nThis could be a typo for \"dent\" the action, meaning to somehow diminish or affect the action in some way.",
