You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\nFor example:\n> open cupboard\n\nIn addition to common actions, you can fress. To fress is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\n\nYour goal for this game is: Put the penol on the table, the mop on the micon and the broom on the micon.\n\nOnce you have achieved your goal, write \"> done\" to end the game.\n\nYou are in a bedroom now. There are a wardrobe, a pillow, a bed and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The book is on the floor.
