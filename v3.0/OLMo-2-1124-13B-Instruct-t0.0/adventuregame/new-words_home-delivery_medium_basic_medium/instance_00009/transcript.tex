	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can babile, ricary and scidia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the riack in the teming, the plate on the taillag and the mop on the taillag.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a riack, a teming, a pillow and a bed. The riack is on the floor. The teming is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.
