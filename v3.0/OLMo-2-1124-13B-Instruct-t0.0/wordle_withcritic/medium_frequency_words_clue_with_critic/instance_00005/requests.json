Common words associated with annoyance or irritation often have sharp, hard consonants. The word \"irritate\" has the letters 't', 'r', 'i', and 'a', which are present in the word \"irate\" and could fit the context of \"tick off.\"\nguess: irate\n\nguess_feedback: i<yellow> r<yellow> a<green> t<green> e<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'i' and 'r' are in the correct position, while 'a' and 't' are correct but in the wrong position. The letter 'e' is incorrect. Considering the clue \"tick off\" and the feedback, the word might have a 'k' which is a common consonant associated with annoyance and fits well with \"tick.\" The word \"irate\" doesn't include 'k', so I'll adjust the guess to include 'k' and maintain the letters that are partially correct.\n\nnew guess: iratek\n\nguess_feedback: i<yellow> r<yellow> a<green> t<green> e<red> k<green>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'i', 'r', 'a', 't', and 'k' are correct.
