      "response": "<|endoftext|><|user|>\nPlease help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: west<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Pantry. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?\n<|assistant|>\nGO: east<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nYou have made a step and entered Dining room.

Currently available directions: north, south, west, east. What is your next instruction?\n<|assistant|>\nSince we have returned to the Recreation room which we've visited before, and assuming the goal is to explore new rooms with the fewest number of room changes, we should reassess our path to ensure we're not retracing steps unnecessarily. Given the options, let's choose a direction that leads us to a new room. \n\nTo avoid redundancy and ensure we're exploring efficiently, let's try:\n\nGO: north\n\nIf north leads to a new room, we continue exploring. If it leads us back to a room we've already visited, we'll need to adjust our strategy accordingly.<|endoftext|>",
