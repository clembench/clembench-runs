	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided has five rows. Let me parse it again.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X X X X X – all Xs. Second row: X followed by four empty squares. Third row: three Xs and then two empty. Fourth and fifth rows: X followed by four empty. So the structure is like a vertical line on the left, then some empty spaces. I need to make sure I represent that correctly. The description should be concise. Maybe count the Xs per row. Let me check again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: 5 Xs. Row 2: 1 X, 4 empty. Row 3: 3 Xs, 2 empty. Row 4: 1 X, 4 empty. Row 5: same as row 4. So the description should capture that. The user will then describe their grid, and we'll ask questions. I need to make sure my description is accurate but not too detailed. Maybe mention the number of Xs in each row. Let me structure it as "DESCRIPTION: 5 Xs in row 1, 1 X followed by 4 empty in row 2, 3 Xs followed by 2 empty in row 3, 1 X followed by 4 empty in rows 4 and 5." That should be clear.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: 5 Xs in row
