Second row: X followed by four empty squares. Third row: three Xs and then two empty. Fourth and fifth rows: X followed by four empty. So the structure is like a vertical line on the left, then some empty spaces. I need to make sure I represent that correctly. The description should be concise. Maybe count the Xs per row. Let me check again:\n\nRow 1: 5 Xs. Row 2: 1 X, 4 empty. Row 3: 3 Xs, 2 empty. Row 4: 1 X, 4 empty. Row 5: same as row 4. So the description should capture that. The user will then describe their grid, and we'll ask questions. I need to make sure my description is accurate but not too detailed. Maybe mention the number of Xs in each row. Let me structure it as \"DESCRIPTION: 5 Xs in row 1, 1 X followed by 4 empty in row 2, 3 Xs followed by 2 empty in row 3, 1 X followed by 4 empty in rows 4 and 5.\" That should be clear.\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION: 5 Xs in row",
