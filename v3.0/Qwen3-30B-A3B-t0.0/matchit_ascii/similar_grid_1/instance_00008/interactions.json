The X's are in the third column for rows 1, 2, 4, and 5. Row 3 is all blanks. I need to describe this grid in a concise way. The user mentioned to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. I should avoid any extra text.\n\nMaybe I can note the positions of the X's. Let's think: in a 5x5 grid, columns 1 to 5, rows 1 to 5. The X's are in (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3). Row 3 has no X's. So the description could be something like \"A 5x5 grid with X's in the third column of rows 1, 2, 4, and 5, and all blanks in",
