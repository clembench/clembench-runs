	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and blanks. Let me make sure I understand it correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt The grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So, each row has five cells. The X's are in the third column for rows 1, 2, 4, and 5. Row 3 is all blanks. I need to describe this grid in a concise way. The user mentioned to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. I should avoid any extra text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe I can note the positions of the X's. Let's think: in a 5x5 grid, columns 1 to 5, rows 1 to 5. The X's are in (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3). Row 3 has no X's. So the description could be something like "A 5x5 grid with X's in the third column of rows 1, 2, 4, and 5, and all blanks in
