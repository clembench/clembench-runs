The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and blank squares. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo each row has five elements. The description needs to be concise. The user mentioned to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. I should probably represent it in a way that's easy to compare. Maybe using letters for rows and numbers for columns? Or just list each row as a string.\n\nWait, the user's example might have used a specific format. Let me check the initial message again. The user's grid is written with each row as a line of symbols. So maybe I should describe each row as a string of X's and ▢'s. Let me count the rows. There are five rows. Each row has five elements. So the description would be:\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: ▢ �",
