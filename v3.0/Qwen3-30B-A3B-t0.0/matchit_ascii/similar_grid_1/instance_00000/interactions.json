The grid they provided is:\n\nX X X X ▢\nX X X ▢ X\nX X ▢ X X\nX ▢ X X X\n▢ X X X X\n\nSo, I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has a combination of X's and a single ▢ (maybe a circle or empty space). \n\nFirst row: four X's followed by a ▢. Second row: three X's, then a ▢, then an X. Third row: two X's, a ▢, then two X's. Fourth row: an X, a ▢, then three X's. Fifth row: a ▢ followed by four X's.\n\nI should check if there's any pattern here. The ▢ seems to be moving from left to right, but not exactly. Let me note the positions:\n\nRow 1: Column 5\nRow 2: Column 4\nRow 3: Column 3\nRow 4: Column 2\nRow 5: Column 1\n\nAh, so the ▢ is moving one position to the left in each subsequent row. That's a clear pattern. So the grid is structured with the ▢ starting at the end of the first row and moving left each row",
