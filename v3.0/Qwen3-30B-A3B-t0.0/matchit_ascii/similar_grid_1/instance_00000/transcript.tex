	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X X X X ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt So, I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has a combination of X's and a single ▢ (maybe a circle or empty space). \\ \tt \\ \tt First row: four X's followed by a ▢. Second row: three X's, then a ▢, then an X. Third row: two X's, a ▢, then two X's. Fourth row: an X, a ▢, then three X's. Fifth row: a ▢ followed by four X's.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should check if there's any pattern here. The ▢ seems to be moving from left to right, but not exactly. Let me note the positions:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: Column 5\\ \tt Row 2: Column 4\\ \tt Row 3: Column 3\\ \tt Row 4: Column 2\\ \tt Row 5: Column 1\\ \tt \\ \tt Ah, so the ▢ is moving one position to the left in each subsequent row. That's a clear pattern. So the grid is structured with the ▢ starting at the end of the first row and moving left each row
