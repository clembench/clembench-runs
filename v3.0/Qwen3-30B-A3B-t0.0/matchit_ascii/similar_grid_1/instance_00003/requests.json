The grid they provided is:\n\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ X X X ▢\nX X X X X\n\nSo I need to make sure I represent this correctly. Each row is five elements. Let me count the rows. There are five rows. The first row has two empty squares, then an X, then two empty. The second row is the same as the first. The third row starts with an empty, then three Xs, then an empty. The fourth row is the same as the third. The fifth row is all Xs.\n\nSo the description should be concise. Maybe note the number of rows and columns, then the pattern. Let me check if there's any symmetry. The first two rows are identical. The third and fourth are the same. The fifth is all Xs. The Xs in the middle rows are centered. So maybe describe it as a 5x5 grid with specific patterns. The user's instruction says to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Don't add anything else. So I need to make sure it's accurate but brief. Let me think of how to phrase it. Maybe:\n\nDESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with the first two rows having X in the third column, the next two rows having X in columns ",
