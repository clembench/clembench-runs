Let me make sure I understand the structure.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo each row has five elements. The X's are positioned diagonally from the top-right to the bottom-left. Let me count the positions. In row 1, the X is in column 5. Row 2, column 4. Row 3, column 3. Row 4, column 2. Row 5, column 1. So it's a diagonal line of X's from top-right to bottom-left. The rest are boxes. \n\nI need to describe this grid in a concise way. The user mentioned to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I should note the size, the positions of the X's. Maybe mention that it's a 5x5 grid with X's along the anti-diagonal. Let me check if there's any other pattern. Each row has exactly one X, and each column has exactly one X. So",
