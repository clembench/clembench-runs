Let me count the X's and the empty squares. \n\nFirst row: X, then three ▢, then X. So positions 1 and 5 are X, others empty.\n\nSecond row: X, X, ▢, X, X. So positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are X, position 3 is empty.\n\nThird row: X, ▢, X, ▢, X. So positions 1, 3, 5 are X, 2 and 4 empty.\n\nFourth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Positions 1 and 5 are X, others empty.\n\nFifth row is the same as the fourth: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X.\n\nSo the grid is symmetric? Let me check. The first and fifth rows are the same. The second row has X's on the ends and in the middle. The third row alternates X and ▢. \n\nI need to describe this grid in a concise way. The",
