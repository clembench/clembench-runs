Let me count the X's and the empty squares. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: X, then three empty, then X. So positions (1,1) and (1,5) are X.\n\nSecond row: X, X, then two empty, then X. So (2,1), (2,2), (2,5).\n\nThird row: X, empty, X, empty, X. So (3,1), (3,3), (3,5).\n\nFourth row: X, empty, empty, X, X. So (4,1), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nFifth row: X, then three empty, then X. Same as the first row: (5,1), (5,5).\n\nSo the grid is symmetric? Let me check. The first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows: second is X X ▢ ▢ X, fourth is X ▢ ▢ X X. Not the same. Third row is X �",
