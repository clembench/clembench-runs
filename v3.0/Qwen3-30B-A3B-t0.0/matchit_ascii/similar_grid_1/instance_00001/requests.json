The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and blank squares. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ X X ▢ ▢\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: ▢ X X ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo each row has five elements. The description needs to be concise. The user mentioned to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. I should probably represent it in a way that's easy to compare. Maybe using letters or numbers? But the original uses X and ▢. Wait, the user's grid uses ▢ (which is a square, maybe representing empty) and X. So I should stick to that notation.\n\nBut how to format it? The user's example shows each row as a line. So I can describe each row as a string of symbols. Let me check the exact arrangement again.\n\nRow 1: two blanks, then X, then two blanks. So \"□ □ X □ □\" but maybe using the actual characters. However, in text, sometimes ▢ is represented as a square. But the user's input uses ▢, so I should replicate that.\n\n",
