The grid they provided is:\n\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nSo, I need to make sure I accurately describe this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. The first row is all X's. The second row starts with X followed by four ▢. The third row has three X's and then two ▢. The fourth row starts with X and then four ▢. The fifth row is all X's again.\n\nI should represent this in a structured way. Maybe list each row. But the user said to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I need to be concise. Let me think of how to describe it clearly. Maybe mention the number of rows and columns, then each row's pattern.\n\nWait, the user's example response was:\n\nDESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with rows: [X X X X X], [X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢], [X X X ▢ ▢], [X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢], [X X X X X]\n\nSo that's a good format.
