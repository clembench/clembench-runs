	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is 5x5 with X's and empty squares. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt Row 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt \\ \tt So each row has five elements. The first and fifth rows start and end with X, with three empty squares in between. The second and fourth rows have X's in the second and fourth positions. The third row has an X in the middle. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to describe this grid in a concise way. The user mentioned to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. I should avoid any extra text. Let me check if there's a standard way to represent grids. Maybe using rows and positions. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. But the user might want a textual description. Let me think. The grid is symmetric? Let me check. Row 1 and 5 are the same. Row 2 and 4 are the same. Row 3 is the middle. So it's symmetric both horizontally and vertically. \\ \tt \\ \tt So the description could mention the symmetry. But maybe the user just wants a straightforward description
