There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: X, then three ▢, then X. So positions (1,1) and (1,5) are X, others are empty.\n\nSecond row: ▢, X, ▢, X, ▢. So (2,2) and (2,4) are X.\n\nThird row: ▢, ▢, X, ▢, ▢. Only (3,3).\n\nFourth row: Same as third? Yes, ▢, ▢, X, ▢, ▢. So (4,3).\n\nFifth row: Same as third and fourth. (5,3).\n\nSo the grid has X's in positions:\n\nRow 1: 1, 5\n\nRow 2: 2, 4\n\nRow 3: 3\n\nRow 4: 3\n\nRow 5: 3\n\nSo when describing the grid, I",
