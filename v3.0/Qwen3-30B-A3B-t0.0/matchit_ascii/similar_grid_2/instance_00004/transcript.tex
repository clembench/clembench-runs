	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided has five rows. The first row is all X's: X X X X X. Then the next four rows have X's in the third position, with the rest being squares (▢). So each of those rows is ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. I need to make sure I capture that correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user mentioned that the grid is 5x5? Let me check. The first line has five X's, so that's five columns. Each subsequent line has five elements as well. So it's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all X's. The other rows have X only in the third column. So the description should reflect that. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. The user said not to add anything else. So I should just write the grid as given. But maybe they want a more concise description instead of writing out all the rows? Wait, the example they gave in the problem shows the grid as written, so maybe I should just present it as is. Let me check the exact input again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first row is five
