The grid they provided is 5x5. Let me check the layout again.\n\nThe first row is all X's: X X X X X. Same for the second row. The third row has two empty squares on the sides, then an X, then two more empty squares. So it's ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. The fourth and fifth rows are all X's again. \n\nSo I need to represent this grid accurately. The description should be concise. Maybe list each row. Let me make sure I don't miss any details. The third row is the only one with empty squares. The rest are all X's. \n\nI should start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the grid. Let me format it correctly. Each row separated by line breaks. Let me check the original input again to confirm. Yes, that's right. So the description would be:\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n\nI think that's it. No extra text, just the grid as specified.\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\nX X X X X<|im_end|>",
