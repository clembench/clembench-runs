	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the user wants me to describe my grid first. Let me look at the grid they provided. It's a 5x5 grid. The first four rows have a square (▢) followed by four Xs. The fifth row is all squares. So, each row is five elements. The first four rows start with a square and then four Xs. The fifth row is all squares.\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure I describe this accurately. The description should be concise. The user mentioned to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. So, I should format it correctly. Let me check again: rows 1-4 are [▢, X, X, X, X], and row 5 is [▢, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢]. That's correct. So the description would be something like "A 5x5 grid where the first four rows each have a square followed by four Xs, and the fifth row is all squares." But maybe more succinctly. Maybe "5x5 grid with first four rows: [▢ X X X X], fifth row: [▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢]." But the user might want it in a specific format. Let me make sure I don't add anything else. Just the description after "DESCRIPTION:".\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with first four rows: [▢ X X X X], fifth row: [▢ �
