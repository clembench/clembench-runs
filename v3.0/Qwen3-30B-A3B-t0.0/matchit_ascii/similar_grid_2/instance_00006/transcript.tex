	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is 5 rows with 5 columns each. Let me parse that.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: all squares are empty, so five ▢. Second row starts with a ▢ followed by four X's. Third row has three ▢ then two X's. Fourth and fifth rows are similar to the second, starting with a ▢ and then four X's. Wait, no, looking again: the fourth row is ▢ X X X X, same as the second. Fifth row is also ▢ X X X X. So the grid has some X's in the second, fourth, and fifth rows, but the third row has fewer X's. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure I describe this accurately. The user's instruction says to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. So I should write each row as they are. Let me check again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ X X X X\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ X X X X\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt Yes, that's correct. So the description should list each row as is. I need to make sure there are no typos. Each row has exactly five elements. The third row has three ▢ followed
