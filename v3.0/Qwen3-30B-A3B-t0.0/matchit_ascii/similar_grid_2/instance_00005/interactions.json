There are five rows. Each row starts and ends with a ▢, except maybe the middle ones? Wait, looking at the first row: ▢ X X X ▢ – yes, starts and ends with ▢. Second row: ▢ ▢ X X ▢ – same. Third: ▢ X ▢ X ▢. Fourth: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. Fifth: ▢ X X X ▢. So each row has five cells, with the first and last being ▢ except maybe the fourth row? Wait, fourth row is ▢ X X ▢ ▢. So first is ▢, then two Xs, then two ▢s. So the fifth row is ▢ X X X ▢, same as the first.\n\nSo the description should be concise. The user said to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I need to write that. Maybe describe each row as a sequence of symbols. Let me check if there's a standard way.
