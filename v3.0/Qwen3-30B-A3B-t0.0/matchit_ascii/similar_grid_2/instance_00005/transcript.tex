	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So, I need to make sure I represent this correctly. Each row has five elements. Let me count the rows. There are five rows. Each row starts and ends with a ▢, except maybe the middle ones? Wait, looking at the first row: ▢ X X X ▢ – yes, starts and ends with ▢. Second row: ▢ ▢ X X ▢ – same. Third: ▢ X ▢ X ▢. Fourth: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. Fifth: ▢ X X X ▢. So each row has five cells, with the first and last being ▢ except maybe the fourth row? Wait, fourth row is ▢ X X ▢ ▢. So first is ▢, then two Xs, then two ▢s. So the fifth row is ▢ X X X ▢, same as the first.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the description should be concise. The user said to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. So I need to write that. Maybe describe each row as a sequence of symbols. Let me check if there's a standard way. Since the user didn
