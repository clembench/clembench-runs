	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and blank squares. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt The grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt Row 3: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So each row has five elements. The description needs to be concise. The user mentioned to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. I should probably represent it in a way that's easy to compare. Maybe using letters for rows and numbers for columns? Or just list each row as a string.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's example might have used a specific format. Let me check the initial message again. The user's grid is written with each row as a line of symbols. So maybe I should describe each row as a string of X's and ▢'s. Let me count the rows. There are five rows. Each row has five elements. So the description would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt Row 3: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ �
