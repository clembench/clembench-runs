The grid they provided is:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n▢ ▢ X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X X X X\n\nSo, I need to make sure I represent this correctly. The grid has 5 rows. Each row has 5 elements. The first row is all X's. The second row has four ▢ followed by an X. The third row has two ▢, then three X's. The fourth row is similar to the second, and the fifth is all X's again.\n\nI should describe this in a concise way. Maybe using a grid format. But the user said to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I need to write that out. Let me check if I have the rows right. First row: 5 Xs. Second: four ▢ and one X. Third: two ▢, three X. Fourth: same as second. Fifth: all X. Yeah, that's correct. So the description should be accurate. I need to make sure I don't add anything else, just the description. Alright, that's it.\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n▢ ▢ X X X\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X X X X",
