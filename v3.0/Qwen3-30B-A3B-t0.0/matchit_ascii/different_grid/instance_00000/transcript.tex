	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt So, I need to make sure I represent this correctly. The grid has 5 rows. Each row has 5 elements. The first row is all X's. The second row has four ▢ followed by an X. The third row has two ▢, then three X's. The fourth row is similar to the second, and the fifth is all X's again.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should describe this in a concise way. Maybe using a grid format. But the user said to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. So I need to write that out. Let me check if I have the rows right. First row: 5 Xs. Second: four ▢ and one X. Third: two ▢, three X. Fourth: same as second. Fifth: all X. Yeah, that's correct. So the description should be accurate. I need to make sure I don't add anything else, just the description. Alright, that's it.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X
