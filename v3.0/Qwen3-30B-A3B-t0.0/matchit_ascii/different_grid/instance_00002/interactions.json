There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: X, then three ▢, then X. So positions (1,1) is X, (1,5) is X, others are ▢.\n\nSecond row: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X. So (2,2) and (2,5) are X.\n\nThird row: ▢, ▢, X, X, X. So columns 3-5 are X.\n\nFourth row: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X. Similar to the second row.\n\nFifth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Same as the first row.\n\nSo the grid is symmetric? Let me check. If I flip it horizontally, does it look the same? First row is X at ends, same as fifth. Second row has X at 2 and 5, which would correspond to fifth row's X at 1 and",
