	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt \\ \tt So I need to make sure I accurately describe this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. Let me check each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X, then three ▢, then X. So positions (1,1) is X, (1,5) is X, others are ▢.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X. So (2,2) and (2,5) are X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: ▢, ▢, X, X, X. So columns 3-5 are X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fourth row: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X. Similar to the second row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fifth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Same as the first row.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the grid is symmetric? Let me check. If I flip it horizontally, does it look the same? First row is X at ends, same as fifth. Second row has X at 2 and 5, which would correspond to fifth row's X at 1 and
