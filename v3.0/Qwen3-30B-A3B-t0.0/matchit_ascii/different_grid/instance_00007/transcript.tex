	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt \\ \tt So, I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. The first row starts and ends with X, with three blanks in the middle. The second row starts with X, then two blanks, then X, X. Third row: X, blank, X, blank, X. Fourth: X, X, blank, blank, X. Fifth: same as the first row.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should describe it in a way that's clear. Maybe mention the number of rows and columns, then each row's pattern. But the user said to start with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. So I need to be concise. Let me check if there's any specific format they want. They didn't mention, so just a straightforward description.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's grid is 5x5. Let me confirm each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 2: X, ▢, ▢, X, X\\ \tt Row 3: X, ▢,
