The grid they provided is:\n\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ X X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX X ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n\nSo, I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. The first row starts and ends with X, with three blanks in the middle. The second row starts with X, then two blanks, then X, X. Third row: X, blank, X, blank, X. Fourth: X, X, blank, blank, X. Fifth: same as the first row.\n\nI should describe it in a way that's clear. Maybe mention the number of rows and columns, then each row's pattern. But the user said to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I need to be concise. Let me check if there's any specific format they want. They didn't mention, so just a straightforward description.\n\nWait, the user's grid is 5x5. Let me confirm each row:\n\nRow 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\nRow 2: X, ▢, ▢, X, X\nRow 3: X, ▢,",
