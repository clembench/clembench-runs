The grid they provided is:\n\n▢ X X X ▢\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX X ▢ X X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\n▢ X X X ▢\n\nSo I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. The symbols are either ▢ or X. \n\nFirst row: ▢ X X X ▢. So positions (1,1) is ▢, then three X's, then ▢ again. \n\nSecond row: X ▢ X ▢ X. Alternating X and ▢ starting with X. \n\nThird row: X X ▢ X X. Two X's, then ▢, then two X's. \n\nFourth row: X ▢ X ▢ X. Same as the second row. \n\nFifth row: ▢ X X X ▢. Same as the first row. \n\nSo the grid is symmetric vertically and horizontally? Let me check. If I flip it horizontally, the first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows are the same. The third row is the middle one. So yes, it's symmetric both vertically and horizontally. \n\nNow, I need to describe this grid in a short way.
