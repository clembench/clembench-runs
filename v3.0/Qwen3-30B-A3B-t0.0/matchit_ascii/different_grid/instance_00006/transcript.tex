	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So I need to make sure I accurately represent this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has 5 elements. The symbols are either ▢ or X. \\ \tt \\ \tt First row: ▢ X X X ▢. So positions (1,1) is ▢, then three X's, then ▢ again. \\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: X ▢ X ▢ X. Alternating X and ▢ starting with X. \\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: X X ▢ X X. Two X's, then ▢, then two X's. \\ \tt \\ \tt Fourth row: X ▢ X ▢ X. Same as the second row. \\ \tt \\ \tt Fifth row: ▢ X X X ▢. Same as the first row. \\ \tt \\ \tt So the grid is symmetric vertically and horizontally? Let me check. If I flip it horizontally, the first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows are the same. The third row is the middle one. So yes, it's symmetric both vertically and horizontally. \\ \tt \\ \tt Now, I need to describe this grid in a short way.
