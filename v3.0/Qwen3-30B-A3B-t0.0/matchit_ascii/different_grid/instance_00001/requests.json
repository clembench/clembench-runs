The grid they provided is:\n\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n\nSo, I need to make sure I accurately describe this grid. Let me count the rows and columns. There are 5 rows and 5 columns. Each row has X's and ▢'s. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: X, then three ▢, then X. So positions (1,1) and (1,5) are X, others are ▢.\n\nSecond row: Same as the first, X at (2,1) and (2,5).\n\nThird row: All X's from (3,1) to (3,5).\n\nFourth row: Same as the first and second, X at (4,1) and (4,5).\n\nFifth row: Same as the first and second, X at (5,1) and (5,5).\n\nSo the grid is symmetric vertically. The middle row is all X's. The other rows have X's only at the ends. So the description should capture that. Maybe mention the structure: 5x5 grid, with the middle row fully filled, and the other rows having X's at the first and last positions, with",
