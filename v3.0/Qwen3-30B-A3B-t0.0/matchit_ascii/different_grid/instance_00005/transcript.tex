	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ X X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X X ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and a square (▢) in specific positions. Each row has a square followed by four X's, but each subsequent row shifts the square one position to the right. So the first row is ▢ X X X X, the second is X ▢ X X X, and so on until the fifth row, which is X X X X ▢. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure my description is accurate. The key here is to note the position of the square in each row. Since it's a 5x5 grid, each row has five elements. The square is in the first position of the first row, second position of the second row, and so on. So the description should clearly state that each row has a single square followed by four X's, with the square moving one column to the right each row. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user's grid is exactly that. So my description should mirror that. Let me check again. The first row: ▢ X X X X. Second: X ▢ X X X. Third: X X ▢ X X. Fourth: X X X ▢ X. Fifth: X X X X ▢. Yes, that's correct. So the description should mention that it's a 5x5 grid with a square in each row, each
