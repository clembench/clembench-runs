The next four rows are the same: X followed by four empty squares. Then the fifth row is all X's. So the grid has five rows. Each row has five cells. The first column has X's in all five rows. The rest of the cells in the first four rows are empty. The fifth row is completely filled with X's.\n\nI need to describe this grid in a concise way. The user said to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I should structure it as such. Let me make sure I get the rows and columns right. Each row is five cells. The first column is X in all rows. The fifth row is all X's. So the description should mention the number of rows and columns, the pattern of X's and empty squares. Maybe something like: \"A 5x5 grid with the first column filled with X's and the fifth row completely filled with X's, while the rest of the cells are empty.\" Wait, but the fifth row is all X's, which includes the first column. So maybe clarify that the first column has X's in all rows, and the fifth row has X's in all columns. But the fifth row's first column is already part of the first column",
