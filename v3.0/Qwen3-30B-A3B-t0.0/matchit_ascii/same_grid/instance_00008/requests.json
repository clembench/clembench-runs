Let me look at the grid they provided. It's a 5x5 grid. The first four rows have a square (▢) followed by four Xs. The fifth row is all squares. So, each row is five elements. The first four rows start with a square and then four Xs. The fifth row is all squares.\n\nI need to make sure I describe this accurately. The description should be concise. The user mentioned to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So, I should format it correctly. Let me check again: rows 1-4 are [▢, X, X, X, X], and row 5 is [▢, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢]. That's correct. So the description would be something like \"A 5x5 grid where the first four rows each have a square followed by four Xs, and the fifth row is all squares.\" But maybe more succinctly. Maybe \"5x5 grid with first four rows: [▢ X X X X], fifth row: [▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢].\" But the user might want it in a specific format. Let me make sure I don't add anything else. Just the description after \"DESCRIPTION:\".\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with first four rows: [▢ X X X X], fifth row: [▢ �",
