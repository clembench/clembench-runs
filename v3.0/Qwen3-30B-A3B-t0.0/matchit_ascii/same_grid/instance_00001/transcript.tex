	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid. The first row is all X's. Then the next rows alternate between X and ▢, starting and ending with X. So rows 2, 3, 4 have X ▢ X ▢ X. The fifth row is all X's again.\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure my description is accurate. Let me count the rows. Yes, five rows. Each row has five elements. The first and last rows are all X. The middle three rows have X, then a square, then X, then a square, then X. So the pattern is X ▢ X ▢ X for rows 2-4. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should write the description as specified, starting with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the grid. I need to represent the grid correctly. Maybe using X's and ▢ symbols. Let me check the original input again. The user's grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt Yes, that's correct. So my description should mirror that. I need to make sure there are no extra spaces or missing elements. Each row should have five elements separated by spaces. Let me write that out.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢
