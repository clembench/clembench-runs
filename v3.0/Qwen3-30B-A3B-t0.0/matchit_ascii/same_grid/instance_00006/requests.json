The grid they provided is 5 rows with 5 columns each. Let me parse that.\n\nFirst row: all squares are empty, so five ▢. Second row starts with a ▢ followed by four X's. Third row has three ▢ then two X's. Fourth and fifth rows are similar to the second, starting with a ▢ and then four X's. Wait, no, looking again: the fourth row is ▢ X X X X, same as the second. Fifth row is also ▢ X X X X. So the grid has some X's in the second, fourth, and fifth rows, but the third row has fewer X's. \n\nI need to make sure I describe this accurately. The user's instruction says to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. So I should write each row as they are. Let me check again:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ X X X X\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ X X\nRow 4: ▢ X X X X\nRow 5: ▢ X X X X\n\nYes, that's correct. So the description should list each row as is. I need to make sure there are no typos. Each row has exactly five elements. The third row has three ▢ followed",
