The fourth and fifth rows are all X's again. \n\nSo I need to represent this grid accurately. The description should be concise. Maybe list each row. Let me make sure I don't miss any details. The third row is the only one with empty squares. The rest are all X's. \n\nI should start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the grid. Let me format it correctly. Each row separated by line breaks. Let me check the original input again to confirm. Yes, that's right. So the description would be:\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\nX X X X X\n\nI think that's it.
