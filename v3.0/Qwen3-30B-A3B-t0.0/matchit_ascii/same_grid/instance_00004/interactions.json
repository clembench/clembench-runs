Then the next four rows have X's in the third position, with the rest being squares (▢). So each of those rows is ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. I need to make sure I capture that correctly.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that the grid is 5x5? Let me check. The first line has five X's, so that's five columns. Each subsequent line has five elements as well. So it's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all X's. The other rows have X only in the third column. So the description should reflect that. \n\nI need to start with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. The user said not to add anything else. So I should just write the grid as given. But maybe they want a more concise description instead of writing out all the rows? Wait, the example they gave in the problem shows the grid as written, so maybe I should just present it as is. Let me check the exact input again.\n\nThe user's grid is:\n\nX X X X X\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo the first row is five",
