The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\n▢ ▢ Z Z ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\n▢ ▢ Z ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

The example given had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So I need to do the same for this new grid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the target grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ Z Z ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ Z ▢ ▢\n\nSo the letters are in positions:\n\nRow 1, column 5 (Z)\nRow 2, columns 3 and 4 (Z, Z)\nRow 4, column 5 (Z)\nRow 5, column 3 (Z)\n\nWait, but the user's example had the E in the second row third column, and then filled the last row with Xs. So maybe the user wants me to generate the commands to create the given grid. But the user's example was a filled grid, and the task is to describe the steps to reach that grid. But in this case, the user provided a grid that's already filled with some letters, and I need to generate the commands to create that grid step by step",
