The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nI ▢ ▢ I ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nI ▢ I I ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe the grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid is 5x5. The example given has some letters already placed. Let me look at the grid they provided.\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: I ▢ ▢ I ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nRow 3: I ▢ I I ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo, the letters are I's and maybe others? Wait, in the example they showed, there was an E and X. But in this case, the user's example has I's. So I need to note the positions of the I's.\n\nFirst, let's list all the I's. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 1: First column is I, fourth column is I. So positions (1,1) and (1,4).\n\nRow 2: Fifth column is I. So (2,5).\n\nRow 3: First column is I, third and fourth columns are I. So (3,1), (3,3), (3,4).\n\nRow 4: Fifth column is I. So (4,5).\n\nRow 5: No I's.\n\nSo total I's: 1,1",
