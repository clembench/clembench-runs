	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ W ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ W ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the cells that have letters, not the empty ones. The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So I need to do the same for this new grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the given grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ W ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: W ▢ W ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to note all the letters present. There's a W in row 1, column 2. Then in row 3, there are Ws in column 1 and 3. Rows 4 and 5 have Ws in column 1. So the initial step would be to place the W in row 1, column 2. Then, handle the Ws in row 3, columns 1 and 3. Then the Ws in rows 4 and 5, column 1. But wait, the user's example had two steps: first placing E, then filling the last row. So maybe I should do similar steps here.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's example had the filled grid with
