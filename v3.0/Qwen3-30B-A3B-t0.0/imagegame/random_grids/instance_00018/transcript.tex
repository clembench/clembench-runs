	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ D ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ D ▢ D D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ D D ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe the given 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ D ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ D ▢ D D\\ \tt Row 3: D ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ D D ▢\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to identify all the letters and their positions. Let's go row by row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1 has a D in the second column. So that's (1,2).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2 has D in the second column, then D in the fourth and fifth. So (2,2), (2,4), (2,5).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3 starts with D in the first column. So (3,1).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 4 has D in the third and fourth columns. So (4,3), (4,4).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 5 has D in the fourth column. So (5,4).\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, the task is to give commands one at a time. The example used "Put an E in second row third column" and then "Fill the last row with X". So each command should be a single action, either placing a single letter, or filling a row/column.\\ \tt \\ \tt But in this case, the user wants me
