You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ W ▢ W\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW W ▢ ▢ W\n▢ W ▢ W ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

The grid provided is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ W ▢ W\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: W W ▢ ▢ W\nRow 5: ▢ W ▢ W ▢\n\nFirst, I should note the positions of each letter. Let's start with the first row. There's a W in column 3 and another in column 5. Then in the second row, there's a W in column 5. The fourth row has W's in columns 1, 2, and 5. The fifth row has W's in columns 2 and 4.\n\nSo the first step might be to place the W's in the first row. But the user's example had putting E in a specific cell, then filling a row. Maybe I should start with the first row. But the user's example had two steps: putting E and then filling the last row. So maybe I need to do similar steps here.\n\nBut the user's instruction says to describe the grid step by step, only the letters. So each command should be placing a letter or filling a row/column. Let me check the example again. The example",
