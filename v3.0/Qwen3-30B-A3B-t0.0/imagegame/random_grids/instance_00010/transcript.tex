	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt Q ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ Q Q ▢ ▢\\ \tt Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\\ \tt ▢ ▢ Q ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ Q ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the cells that have letters, not the empty ones. The example given was placing an E and then filling the last row with Xs. Now, the grid they provided has some Qs already. Let me look at the grid again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ Q Q ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ Q ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ Q ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the task is to describe each step, starting with the existing Qs. But wait, the user says "fill an empty grid" but the example they gave had some letters already. Wait, no, the initial problem says that the grid is empty, but then the example shows a filled grid. Wait, maybe the user is giving an example of a filled grid, and the actual task is to describe how to create that grid step by step. But the user's instruction says: "I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares... Only describe the location of letters in the grid."\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the user is providing a filled grid (with Qs) and wants me to generate the commands
