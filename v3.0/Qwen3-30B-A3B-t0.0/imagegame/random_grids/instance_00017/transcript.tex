	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt R ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the cells that have letters. The example they gave was placing an E and then filling the last row with Xs. So I need to do the same for this new grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the given grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: R ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt \\ \tt So the letters are R in positions (1,1), (1,4), (3,4), (4,4), and (5,5). Wait, but the user's example had E in second row third column, which is (2,3), and then filled the last row with Xs. So I need to translate the current grid into commands.\\ \tt \\ \tt The first step is to note the R's. Let's check each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1 has R in column 1 and 4. So maybe start by placing R in (1,1) and (1,4). But the user's example had individual commands. However, maybe there's a way to do multiple cells at once. But the user said "you can give
