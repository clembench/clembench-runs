The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ U ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nU ▢ U ▢ U\n▢ U ▢ U ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe how to fill the grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The example given was a 5x5 grid with some letters already placed. The task is to provide commands one at a time, each referring to cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. The user will then ask for the next command after each step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the initial grid provided. The user's example grid is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ U ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: U ▢ U ▢ U\nRow 4: ▢ U ▢ U ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nWait, but the user says \"the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid\" and shows that grid. But the initial problem says that the user wants me to describe the grid step by step, but in this case, the grid is already filled with some letters. Wait, no, maybe the user is giving an example of how the process works. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's message starts with \"Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid...\" and then shows an example of a filled grid. Then they say \"I want you to describe this grid to",
