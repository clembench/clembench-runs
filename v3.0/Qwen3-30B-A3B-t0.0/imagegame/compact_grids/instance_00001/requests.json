You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the cells that have letters. The example they gave was placing an E and then filling the last row with Xs. So I need to do the same for this new grid.\n\nThe current grid has F's in the second row and the fourth row. The rest are empty. So the first step is to place the F's in the second row. But wait, the user's example had \"Put an E in second row third column\" and then \"Fill the last row with X\". So maybe I should start by addressing the second row first.\n\nBut the second row is all F's. So maybe the first command is to fill the second row with F's. Then the fourth row is also all F's, so the next command would be to fill the fourth row with F's. But wait, the user's example had two separate commands for different rows. But in the example, they first placed a single E and then filled a whole row. So maybe here, since the second row is all F's, I can do \"Fill the second row with F\" and then \"Fill the fourth row with F\". But the user might want to do it step by step. However, the user's instruction says that each command can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. So maybe I can",
