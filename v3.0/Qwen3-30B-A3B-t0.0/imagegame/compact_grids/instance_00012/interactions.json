The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nT ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T T ▢ ▢\nT T T T ▢\nT T T T T\nWhat is your next command?",

The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So I need to do something similar for this new grid.\n\nThe target grid is:\n\nT ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T T ▢ ▢\nT T T T ▢\nT T T T T\n\nLooking at this, each row seems to have an increasing number of Ts. The first row has one T, the second two, and so on. So the pattern is that each row i (starting from 1) has i Ts, and the rest are empty. But the user wants me to describe the steps to build this grid.\n\nWait, but the user's example had two steps: placing E and then filling the last row. So maybe I need to break down the current grid into steps. But how?\n\nThe current grid is already filled with Ts in a diagonal pattern. But since the user wants me to describe the process of filling it, I need to think about how to build it step by step. However, the user's example had a grid that was partially filled, and the steps were adding elements. But in this case, the grid is already filled. Wait, no, the user is",
