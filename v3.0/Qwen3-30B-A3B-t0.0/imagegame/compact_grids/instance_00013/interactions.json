You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nD D D D D\nD ▢ D ▢ D\nD D D D D\nD ▢ D ▢ D\nD D D D D\nWhat is your next command?",

The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and Xs in the last row. So I need to do something similar for this new grid.\n\nLooking at the target grid:\n\nRow 1: D D D D D\nRow 2: D ▢ D ▢ D\nRow 3: D D D D D\nRow 4: D ▢ D ▢ D\nRow 5: D D D D D\n\nSo the empty cells are in positions (2,2), (2,4), (4,2), (4,4). The rest are D's. But the user's example had the E and X's, so maybe in this case, the D's are already filled, and the empty squares are the ones to note? Wait, no. Wait, the user's instruction says that the filled grid has some letters, and we need to describe the locations of the letters. The initial grid is empty, and the example filled grid had E and X's. But in this case, the user is showing a grid that's partially filled with D's and some empty squares. Wait, maybe the task is to describe how to create this grid? Or is this the grid that's already filled, and I need to describe the positions of the letters",
