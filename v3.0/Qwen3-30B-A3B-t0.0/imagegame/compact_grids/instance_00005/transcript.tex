	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W W W W W\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the non-empty cells. The example given has an E in the second row, third column and the last row filled with Xs. The current problem is a grid where the first column has W's in the first four rows, and the fifth row is all W's.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the initial grid provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W W W W W\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out the steps to describe this. The user's example had two steps: placing E and filling the last row. Here, the first four cells of the first column are W, and the fifth row is all Ws.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user's example had the last row as Xs, but here the fifth row is Ws. So the task is to describe the given grid. But the user's instruction says that the filled grid is 5x5 and can look like the example. But in this case, the user is providing a specific grid and wants me to describe how to create it step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's example was a filled grid with E and Xs, and the steps were to put E and fill the last row.
