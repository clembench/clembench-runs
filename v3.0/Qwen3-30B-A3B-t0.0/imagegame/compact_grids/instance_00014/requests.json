The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nB ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ B ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ B ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ B\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the letters, not the empty squares. The example given has an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. The current grid they provided has B's along the diagonal: first row first column, second row second, etc., up to fifth row fifth.\n\nSo the task is to generate the commands step by step. The user's example started with placing E and then filling the last row. Now, for this new grid, the B's are on the main diagonal. The user probably wants me to generate commands that place each B in their respective positions. But how to approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the correct commands. The grid is 5x5. The B's are at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5) if we consider rows and columns starting at 1. So each B is in the i-th row and i-th column for i from 1 to 5.\n\nBut the user's example had two steps: placing E and then filling a row. So maybe here, I can either place each B one by one or find a pattern. However, the user might want each step to be a single command. But the problem says that each command can refer to single or multiple cells",
