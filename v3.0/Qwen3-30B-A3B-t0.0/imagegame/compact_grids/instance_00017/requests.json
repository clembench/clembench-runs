You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ R\n▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\nR ▢ ▢ R ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ R\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe the given 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid provided is:\n\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ R\n▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\nR ▢ ▢ R ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ R\n\nFirst, I need to identify each 'R' and note their positions. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: The first cell is R. So that's (1,1).\n\nRow 2: The second cell is R (position 2,2), and the fifth cell is R (2,5).\n\nRow 3: The third cell is R (3,3).\n\nRow 4: The first cell is R (4,1), and the fourth cell is R (4,4).\n\nRow 5: The second cell is R (5,2), and the fifth cell is R (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to issue commands one at a time. The example given used \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So, the commands can be either placing a single letter in a specific cell or filling a row/column.\n\nBut in this case, all the R's are already placed.
