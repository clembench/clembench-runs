	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt R ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt ▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\\ \tt R ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe the given 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid provided is:\\ \tt \\ \tt R ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt ▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\\ \tt R ▢ ▢ R ▢\\ \tt ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to identify each 'R' and note their positions. Let me go row by row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: The first cell is R. So that's (1,1).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: The second cell is R (position 2,2), and the fifth cell is R (2,5).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3: The third cell is R (3,3).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 4: The first cell is R (4,1), and the fourth cell is R (4,4).\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 5: The second cell is R (5,2), and the fifth cell is R (5,5).\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, I need to issue commands one at a time. The example given used "Put an E in second row third column" and "Fill the last row with X". So, the commands can be either placing a single letter in a specific cell or filling a row/column.\\ \tt \\ \tt But in this case, all the R's are already placed. Wait, the user's example was about filling an empty grid, but here the grid is
