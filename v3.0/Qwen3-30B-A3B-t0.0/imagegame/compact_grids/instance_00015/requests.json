You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the letters and not the empty squares. The example given has an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So, I need to follow a similar approach for the new grid.\n\nThe target grid has 'W's in the fifth row and the fifth column. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ W\nRow 5: W W W W W\n\nSo, the fifth column (column 5) has 'W's in rows 1-4, and the fifth row (row 5) is all 'W's. The task is to describe the steps to create this grid.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the most efficient way to place the 'W's. The fifth column has four 'W's, and the fifth row has five 'W's. But since the fifth row's fifth column is already part of the fifth column, there's an overlap there.\n\nOne approach could be to first fill the fifth column with 'W's, then fill the fifth row.
