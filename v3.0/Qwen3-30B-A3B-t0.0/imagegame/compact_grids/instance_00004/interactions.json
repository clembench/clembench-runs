You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nR R R R R\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nR R R R R\nWhat is your next command?",

The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. Now the new grid they provided has the first and last rows all R's, and the middle three rows have R's in the first and last columns, with empty spaces in between.\n\nSo the grid looks like this:\n\nRow 1: R R R R R\nRow 2: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 3: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 4: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 5: R R R R R\n\nThe task is to describe the locations of the letters, starting with the first step. The user wants each command to be a single step, and after each, I have to wait for \"What is your next command?\".\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the initial state is. The grid is empty except for the borders. Wait, no—the example they gave had the filled grid with E and Xs, but the current problem is to describe the grid that's already filled as shown. Wait, no, the user is giving me a filled grid and wants me to describe how to create it step by step. Wait, no, the user says: \"I want you to describe this",
