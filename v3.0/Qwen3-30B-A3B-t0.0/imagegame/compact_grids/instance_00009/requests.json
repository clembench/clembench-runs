You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the cells that have letters, not the empty ones. The example given has an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So I need to follow that pattern.\n\nThe current grid provided is:\n\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\n\nLooking at this, each row has I's in the first, third, and fifth columns. So every row is the same: I, empty, I, empty, I. The task is to describe the locations of the letters. Since all the I's are in the same positions in each row, maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to represent this. The user's example used specific positions, like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So for this grid, the I's are in columns 1, 3, 5 for each row. But since the grid is 5x5, rows are 1-5 and columns 1-5.\n\nBut the user's example had a single E and then filling a row. Here, there are multiple I's. So maybe the first step is to",
