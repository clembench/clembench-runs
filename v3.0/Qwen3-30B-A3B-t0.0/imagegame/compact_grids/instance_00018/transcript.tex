	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D D D D D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the non-empty cells. The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and then filled the last row with Xs. So I need to do something similar for this new grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt The target grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D D D D D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt D ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out the positions of all the Ds. Let me visualize the grid. Each row is 5 columns. Let's go row by row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: First and last cells are D. So positions (1,1) and (1,5).\\ \tt Row 2: Similarly, (2,1) and (2,5).\\ \tt Row 3: All cells are D, so (3,1) to (3,5).\\ \tt Row 4: (4,1) and (4,5).\\ \tt Row 5: (5,1) and (5,5).\\ \tt \\ \tt So the Ds are on the first and last columns of each row, except the third row which is fully filled. Wait, but the third row is all Ds. So maybe the first step is to fill the third row completely. Then handle the other rows.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the
