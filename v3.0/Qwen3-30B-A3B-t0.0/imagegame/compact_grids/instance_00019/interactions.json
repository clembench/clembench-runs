You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nK K K K K\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K K ▢ K\n▢ K ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K K K K\nWhat is your next command?",

The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and then filled the last row with Xs. So I need to do something similar for this new grid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the target grid they provided. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: K K K K K\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\nRow 3: ▢ K K ▢ K\nRow 4: ▢ K ▢ ▢ K\nRow 5: ▢ K K K K\n\nSo the task is to figure out the commands to create this grid. The user wants each step to be a command, and each command can affect multiple cells, rows, or columns. But I have to make sure I don't mention the empty squares (the ▢s). \n\nStarting with the first row: all Ks. So maybe the first command is to fill the first row with K. But wait, the example had \"Fill the last row with X\", so maybe similar here. But the first row is all Ks. So command: Fill first row with K.\n\nThen, looking at row 2: the last cell is K, others are empty. So maybe command: Put K in second row fifth column. But maybe there's",
