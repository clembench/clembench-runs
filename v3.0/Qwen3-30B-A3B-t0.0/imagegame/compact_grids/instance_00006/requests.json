The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n▢ M ▢ M ▢\nM ▢ ▢ ▢ M\n▢ M ▢ M ▢\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the cells that have letters. The example given has an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. So I need to do the same for this new grid.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the target grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ M ▢ M ▢\nRow 3: M ▢ ▢ ▢ M\nRow 4: ▢ M ▢ M ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n\nSo the letters are M's in various positions. Let me note their positions.\n\nRow 1, column 3: M\nRow 2, column 2 and 4: M\nRow 3, column 1 and 5: M\nRow 4, column 2 and 4: M\nRow 5, column 3: M\n\nSo the plan is to place each M step by step. But maybe there's a pattern here. It looks like the M's form a kind of diamond or cross shape. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: M is in the middle (column 3)\nRow 2: M's in columns 2 and 4 (left and right of center)\nRow 3: M's",
