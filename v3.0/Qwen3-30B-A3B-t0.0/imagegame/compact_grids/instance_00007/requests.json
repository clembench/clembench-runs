You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user wants me to describe how to fill a 5x5 grid step by step, but only mention the non-empty cells. The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with Xs. Now the new grid they provided has a diagonal of Ts starting from the top-left, with each subsequent row starting one column later.\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 1: T T T T T\nRow 2: ▢ T T T T\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ T T T\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ T T\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\n\nI need to figure out the steps to build this. The first thing I notice is that each row has a T starting at a different column. Row 1 has T in all columns, but the example might have a different structure. Wait, no, the user's example is different. Wait, the user's example is a grid where the first row is all Ts, then the second row has a T starting at column 2, and so on. So the pattern is that each row i has a T starting at column i, but since the grid is 5x5, maybe each row has a T in the diagonal and to the right?\n\nWait, looking at the given grid:\n\nRow 1: T T T T T → all columns",
