You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: comatose",

Hmm, \"comatose\" is a longer word, but maybe the target word is related. Wait, the target is a 5-letter English word. Let me think about possible words related to \"comatose\".\n\n\"Comatose\" means in a state of unconsciousness, like a coma. Maybe the word is \"coma\"? But that's four letters. Wait, the target is five letters. What else? \"Sleep\"? No, that's five letters but not directly related. \"Stupor\"? That's six letters. \"Drowsy\"? Five letters, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a hint towards the letters. Let me check the letters in \"comatose\". C, O, M, A, T, O, S, E. But the target is five letters. Maybe the answer is \"comet\"? But how does that relate to \"comatose\"? Or \"mater\"? Not sure. Wait, the example given was \"apple\" based on the clue \"snowy white\" because of Snow White and the poisoned apple. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's part of a story or a concept related to \"comatose\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clue is a play on words. \"Comatose\" could be broken",
