You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart",

The user mentioned that the target word is a five-letter English word. \n\nThe phrase \"hit by heart\" might be a bit tricky. Maybe it's a song or a movie from 1985? Let me think. There was a song called \"Take On Me\" by a-ha, but that's 7 letters. Wait, \"Heart\" is a band, but their hits... Maybe \"Heaven\" from 1985? No, that's 6 letters. \n\nWait, the clue could be a play on words. \"Hit by heart\" might not be literal. Maybe \"heart\" is part of the word. Let me think of 5-letter words related to \"heart.\" There's \"heart\" itself, but that's 5 letters. But the clue says \"1985 hit by heart.\" Maybe the hit is a song that's a \"heart\" something. \n\nAlternatively, think of the word \"heart\" and how it's part of the clue. Maybe the answer is \"heart,\" but the clue is a bit cryptic. But the user's example used \"apple\" based on a fairy tale. So maybe the clue is a reference to a song or a movie. \n\nWait,",
