The clue is \"stand in (for)\". Hmm, so I need to think of a five-letter word that fits this clue. The phrase \"stand in for\" usually means to replace someone or something. Like, if someone can't do a job, another person stands in for them. So maybe the word is \"stand\" itself? But wait, \"stand\" is five letters. Wait, \"stand\" is s-t-a-n-d. But the clue is \"stand in (for)\", which might be a hint towards a word that means to substitute or replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"stand\" but the clue is a bit of a play on words. Let me think. Another possibility is \"fill in\" as in \"fill in for someone\", but \"fill in\" is two words. The target word is five letters. \"Filler\" is six letters. \"Substitute\" is too long. \"Stand in\" could be a hint for \"stand\" as in \"stand in for someone\". But maybe the answer is \"stand\". Let me check the example given. In the example, the clue was \"snowy white\" and the answer was \"apple\" because of the Snow White story. So maybe the clue here is a bit more direct.\n\nWait, \"stand in (for)\" could be a hint for the word \"stand\" because \"stand in\" is part of the phrase. But maybe the answer",
