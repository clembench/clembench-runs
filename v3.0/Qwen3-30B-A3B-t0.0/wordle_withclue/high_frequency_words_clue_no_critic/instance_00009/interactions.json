You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: gauge reading",

But \"gauge reading\" might refer to the measurement shown on a gauge. So maybe the target word is related to that.\n\nFirst, I need to think of five-letter words that are synonyms for gauge or related to readings. Words like \"scale\" come to mind, but that's five letters. Or \"meter\"? Wait, \"meter\" is five letters. But \"gauge\" itself is five letters. But the clue is \"gauge reading,\" so maybe the answer is a word that's a type of gauge or a reading.\n\nWait, \"gauge\" can also mean a measure of something, like the thickness of a wire. But \"reading\" could be a measurement. Maybe the word is \"scale\" as in a scale of measurement. Or \"index\"? No, that's five letters. \"Index\" is a type of reading? Maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, think of the word \"meter\" as a gauge. But \"meter\" is a valid word. Let me check. The clue is \"gauge reading,\" so maybe the answer is \"meter.\" But I'm not sure. Another thought: \"gauge\" can be a verb, like to gauge something. But the target word is a noun. \n\nWait, the example given was \"apple\" based on the clue \"snow",
