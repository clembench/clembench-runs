You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: others'",

The target word is a five-letter English word.\n\nFirst, \"others'\" is a possessive form, like \"others' opinions\". But the target word is five letters. Maybe the word is \"other\" itself, but that's five letters. Wait, \"other\" is five letters: O-T-H-E-R. But the clue is \"others'\", which is plural. Hmm. But maybe the answer is \"other\" and the clue is pointing towards that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different word.\n\nWait, the example given was \"apple\" based on the clue \"snowy white\" because of Snow White. So the clue is a hint towards the word. So \"others'\" could be a hint towards \"other\" but with an apostrophe. But the word has to be five letters. \"Other\" is five letters. But the clue is \"others'\", which is plural. Maybe the answer is \"other\" and the clue is a bit of a trick. Alternatively, maybe it's \"other\" and the apostrophe is just part of the clue, not the word.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's related to \"others\" in some way. For example, \"other\" is a synonym for \"others\" in some contexts",
