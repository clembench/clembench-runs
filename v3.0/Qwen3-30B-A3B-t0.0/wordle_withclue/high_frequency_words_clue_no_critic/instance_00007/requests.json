The user provided a clue: \"others'\". So, I need to think about words that relate to \"others\" or maybe something that's possessive. The target word is a five-letter English word.\n\nFirst, \"others'\" is a possessive form, like \"others' opinions\". But the target word is five letters. Maybe the word is \"other\" itself, but that's five letters. Wait, \"other\" is five letters: O-T-H-E-R. But the clue is \"others'\", which is plural. Hmm. But maybe the answer is \"other\" and the clue is pointing towards that. Alternatively, maybe it's a different word.\n\nWait, the example given was \"apple\" based on the clue \"snowy white\" because of Snow White. So the clue is a hint towards the word. So \"others'\" could be a hint towards \"other\" but with an apostrophe. But the word has to be five letters. \"Other\" is five letters. But the clue is \"others'\", which is plural. Maybe the answer is \"other\" and the clue is a bit of a trick. Alternatively, maybe it's \"other\" and the apostrophe is just part of the clue, not the word.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's related to \"others\" in some way. For example, \"other\" is a synonym for \"others\" in some contexts",
