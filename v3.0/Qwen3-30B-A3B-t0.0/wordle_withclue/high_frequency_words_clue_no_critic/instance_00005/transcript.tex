	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: divine ___

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the user gave me a clue: "divine ___". I need to guess a 5-letter word that fits this. Let's think. The word "divine" is 6 letters, but the target is 5. So maybe the clue is hinting at a word that's related to "divine" but shorter. Wait, the clue might be a hint towards a word that's a synonym or a related term.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me think of synonyms for divine. Words like "heavenly" but that's too long. "Sacred" is 6 letters. "Holy" is 4. "Angelic" is 7. Hmm. Maybe the clue is a play on words. "Divine" could be part of the word. Wait, the target word is 5 letters. What if the word is "angel"? But that's not directly related. Or "divine" itself is 6 letters. Maybe the clue is a hint towards "divine" plus something else. Wait, maybe the answer is "divin" but that's not a word. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's a part of "divine". \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given was "snowy white" leading to "apple" because of the fairy tale. So maybe the clue here is a hint towards a word that's part of a phrase or a story. "Divine" could be part of a
