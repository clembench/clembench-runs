	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: "...called for his fiddlers ___"

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's tackle this Wordle puzzle. The clue is "...called for his fiddlers ___". Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word that fits here. The phrase "called for his fiddlers" makes me think of a common expression or a song title. Wait, there's a song called "Fiddler on the Roof," but that's longer. Maybe "fiddlers" is part of a phrase. Oh, "fiddlers" could be part of "fiddlers' green," but that's six letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the phrase "called for his fiddlers" might be part of a proverb or a common saying. Maybe "fiddlers" is followed by a word like "three" or "four," but those are not five letters. Wait, "fiddlers" is plural, so maybe the next word is "three" but that's five letters. Wait, "three" is five letters. But "called for his fiddlers three"? Doesn't ring a bell. Maybe "fiddlers" is part of a different phrase.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue is a fill-in-the-blank. The structure is "...called for his fiddlers ___". The blank is a five-letter word. Let me think of common words that follow "fiddlers". Maybe "fiddlers' hands"? No, that
