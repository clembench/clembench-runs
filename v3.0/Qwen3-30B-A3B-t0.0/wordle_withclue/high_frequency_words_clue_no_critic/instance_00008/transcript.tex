	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tv show since 1/14/52

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's tackle this Wordle puzzle. The clue given is "tv show since 1/14/52". Hmm, first, I need to figure out what TV show that refers to. The date 1/14/52 might be significant. Wait, January 14, 1952, was the premiere date of "I Love Lucy," but that's a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a show that started on that date. Another thought: "Since 1/14/52" could be a reference to a show that's been on for a long time. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the date is a red herring, and the key is the phrase "tv show since 1/14/52". \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, another angle: "1/14/52" could be a date format. In some countries, it's day/month/year, but 1/14/52 would be January 14, 1952. But maybe it's a code. Alternatively, think of the numbers as part of the word. But the target word is five letters. Let me think of TV shows with five letters. "Star Trek" is too long. "Friends" is six letters. "The Office" is longer. "Breaking Bad" is way too long. Maybe "The Sopranos" no. Wait,
