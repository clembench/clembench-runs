You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: tend the hearth",

The target is a 5-letter English word.\n\nFirst, I should break down the clue. \"Tend the hearth\" – maybe it's a phrase that relates to a common word. Tend the hearth could mean to take care of the fireplace, but how does that translate to a 5-letter word? Let me think of synonyms or related terms. \"Tend\" could mean to care for, and \"hearth\" is a fireplace. Maybe the word is related to fire or keeping it going. Words like \"ember\" or \"flame\"? But \"ember\" is 5 letters. Wait, \"ember\" is e-m-b-e-r. But how does \"tend the hearth\" connect to that? Maybe the answer is \"ember\". Alternatively, \"tend\" could be part of the word. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the clue is a hint towards a specific word. For example, \"tend the hearth\" might be a reference to a specific term. Or maybe it's a play on words. \"Hearth\" is sometimes associated with home, but that's not 5 letters. \"Tend\" could be part of the word. Let me think of 5-letter words that include \"tend\" – but \"t",
