You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: shrewd",

Let me think. Words related to shrewd... maybe \"sharp\"? But that's 5 letters. Wait, \"shrewd\" itself is 6 letters. Oh, wait, the target word is 5 letters. So maybe a synonym. Let me think. \"Clever\" is 6 letters. \"Smart\" is 5. But how does the clue connect? Alternatively, maybe a word that's part of the clue. Wait, the example given was \"snowy white\" leading to \"apple\" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's part of a phrase or a concept related to \"shrewd\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"shrewd\" is a hint towards the word \"shrew\" but that's 5 letters. Wait, \"shrew\" is 5 letters. But how does that connect? Or maybe \"shrewd\" is the clue, and the word is \"shrew\" but with an extra letter? Not sure. Alternatively, think of words that have \"sh\" or \"rew\" in them. Or maybe the word is \"slyly\" but that's not related. Wait, maybe the answer is \"shrew\"",
