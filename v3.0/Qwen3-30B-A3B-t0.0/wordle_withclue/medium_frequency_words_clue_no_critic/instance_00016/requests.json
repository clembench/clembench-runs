The clue is \"shrewd\". I need to think of a 5-letter word related to that. Shrewd means clever or sharp, maybe? But how does that translate to a word? Let me think. Words related to shrewd... maybe \"sharp\"? But that's 5 letters. Wait, \"shrewd\" itself is 6 letters. Oh, wait, the target word is 5 letters. So maybe a synonym. Let me think. \"Clever\" is 6 letters. \"Smart\" is 5. But how does the clue connect? Alternatively, maybe a word that's part of the clue. Wait, the example given was \"snowy white\" leading to \"apple\" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's part of a phrase or a concept related to \"shrewd\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"shrewd\" is a hint towards the word \"shrew\" but that's 5 letters. Wait, \"shrew\" is 5 letters. But how does that connect? Or maybe \"shrewd\" is the clue, and the word is \"shrew\" but with an extra letter? Not sure. Alternatively, think of words that have \"sh\" or \"rew\" in them. Or maybe the word is \"slyly\" but that's not related. Wait, maybe the answer is \"shrew\"",
