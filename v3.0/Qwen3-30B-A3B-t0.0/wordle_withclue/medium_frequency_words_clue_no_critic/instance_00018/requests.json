The clue is \"court activity.\" Hmm, court activity... Maybe it's something related to a tennis court? Because tennis is a common activity played on a court. Let me think. The word needs to be five letters. Tennis is five letters: T-E-N-N-I-S. Wait, no, that's six letters. T-E-N-N-I-S is six. Oh, right. So that's not it. What else? Maybe \"game\"? But that's four letters. \"Match\"? That's five letters. Match could be an activity in a court. But is there a better fit?\n\nAlternatively, \"court\" itself is five letters, but the clue is \"court activity,\" so maybe the activity is something else. Like \"tennis\" but shortened? Or maybe \"rally\"? Rally is a term used in tennis, and it's five letters. R-A-L-L-Y. That's five letters. Or \"serve\"? S-E-R-V-E. Also five letters. But how does that connect to the clue?\n\nWait, the example given was \"snowy white\" leading to \"apple\" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a specific word. Let me think again. \"Court activity\" – maybe \"play\"? But that's four letters. \"Game\" is four. \"Match\" is five. Or \"court\" plus something. Maybe \"tennis\" but as a five-letter",
