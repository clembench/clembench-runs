	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: court activity

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "court activity." Hmm, court activity... Maybe it's something related to a tennis court? Because tennis is a common activity played on a court. Let me think. The word needs to be five letters. Tennis is five letters: T-E-N-N-I-S. Wait, no, that's six letters. T-E-N-N-I-S is six. Oh, right. So that's not it. What else? Maybe "game"? But that's four letters. "Match"? That's five letters. Match could be an activity in a court. But is there a better fit?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "court" itself is five letters, but the clue is "court activity," so maybe the activity is something else. Like "tennis" but shortened? Or maybe "rally"? Rally is a term used in tennis, and it's five letters. R-A-L-L-Y. That's five letters. Or "serve"? S-E-R-V-E. Also five letters. But how does that connect to the clue?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given was "snowy white" leading to "apple" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a specific word. Let me think again. "Court activity" â€“ maybe "play"? But that's four letters. "Game" is four. "Match" is five. Or "court" plus something. Maybe "tennis" but as a five-letter
