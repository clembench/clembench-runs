	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like venture capital investments

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "like venture capital investments." Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word that relates to venture capital. Venture capital is about investing in startups, right? So maybe words related to that. Let me think... "Startups" is too long. What about "angel"? Wait, angel investors are a part of venture capital. But "angel" is five letters. A-N-G-E-L. Let me check. But the clue says "like venture capital investments," so maybe the word is "angel" because angel investors are a type of venture capital. Alternatively, maybe "funds"? But that's five letters. Wait, "funds" is more general. Or "shares"? No, that's six letters. Wait, "stock" is five letters, but that's more about shares. Alternatively, "money" but that's too generic. Wait, the example given was "apple" based on Snow White. So maybe the answer is a term specific to venture capital. Let me think again. Venture capital investments are often in startups, so maybe "start" but that's five letters. But "start" is more about beginning. Alternatively, "angel" as in angel investor. Let me go with "angel" as the first guess. So the explanation would be that angel investors are a type of venture capital, and "angel" is five letters.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: Venture capital investments are often
