The user gave me a clue: \"like algae\". I need to figure out the target word. First, I should think about words related to algae. Algae are simple aquatic organisms, often green, and they can be part of a larger ecosystem. The word \"algae\" itself is five letters, but maybe the target word is something else.\n\nThe example given was \"apple\" based on the clue \"snowy white\" because of Snow White. So the clue here might be a hint towards a word that's associated with algae. Let me think of synonyms or related terms. Words like \"seaweed\" come to mind, but that's seven letters. \"Algal\" is an adjective, but that's five letters. Wait, \"algal\" is a word, but is it a valid English word? Maybe. Alternatively, \"green\" could be a clue since algae are green, but \"green\" is five letters. But the clue is \"like algae\", so maybe the word is \"algae\" itself. But the user said the target word is a valid English word, and \"algae\" is valid. However, the example used \"apple\" which is a direct reference. \n\nWait, the clue is \"like algae\", so maybe the target word is a synonym. Let me think. Another possibility is \"seaweed\" but again, too long. \"Kelp\" is four letters. \"M",
