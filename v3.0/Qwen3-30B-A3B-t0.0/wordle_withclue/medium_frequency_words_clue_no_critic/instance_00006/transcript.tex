	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like algae

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user gave me a clue: "like algae". I need to figure out the target word. First, I should think about words related to algae. Algae are simple aquatic organisms, often green, and they can be part of a larger ecosystem. The word "algae" itself is five letters, but maybe the target word is something else.\\ \tt \\ \tt The example given was "apple" based on the clue "snowy white" because of Snow White. So the clue here might be a hint towards a word that's associated with algae. Let me think of synonyms or related terms. Words like "seaweed" come to mind, but that's seven letters. "Algal" is an adjective, but that's five letters. Wait, "algal" is a word, but is it a valid English word? Maybe. Alternatively, "green" could be a clue since algae are green, but "green" is five letters. But the clue is "like algae", so maybe the word is "algae" itself. But the user said the target word is a valid English word, and "algae" is valid. However, the example used "apple" which is a direct reference. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue is "like algae", so maybe the target word is a synonym. Let me think. Another possibility is "seaweed" but again, too long. "Kelp" is four letters. "M
