	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: passenger ship

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's tackle this Wordle puzzle. The clue given is "passenger ship." Hmm, so I need to think of a five-letter word that's a type of passenger ship. First, I should recall different types of ships. The most common ones might be "liner," "cruise," but wait, "cruise" is six letters. "Steam" is five letters, but is that a passenger ship? Maybe not. "Yacht" is another possibility, but that's more of a private vessel. Wait, "ferry" comes to mind. A ferry is a ship that carries passengers, and it's five letters. Let me check: F-E-R-R-Y. Yes, that's five letters. Another possibility could be "boat," but that's too generic. "Ship" itself is four letters. "Steamer" is longer. So "ferry" seems like a good guess. Let me think if there's another option. Maybe "liner" as in a passenger liner. L-I-N-E-R. That's five letters. But is "liner" considered a passenger ship? Yes, like a cruise liner. So both "ferry" and "liner" are possibilities. Which one is more likely? The clue is "passenger ship," so maybe "liner" is more specific. But I need to decide. Let me go with "liner" first. Wait, but the example given in the problem was "apple
