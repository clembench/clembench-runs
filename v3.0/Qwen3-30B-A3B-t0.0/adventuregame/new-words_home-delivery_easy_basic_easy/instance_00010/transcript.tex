	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can fress. To fress is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the penol on the table, the mop on the micon and the broom on the micon.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

But first, I need to figure out what's available here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the current items mentioned are a book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The passage is to a hallway. But the goal items are penol, mop, broom. Hmm, maybe those are in other locations. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it would reveal something. The book is on the floor, maybe pick that up? But the goal isn't about the book. The user needs to find the penol, mop, and broom. Since the wardrobe is closed, perhaps opening it would get the penol? Or maybe the hallway has those items. But the user hasn't explored the hallway yet. So the first step might be to go to the hallway. But the user's current location is the bedroom. So possible actions: open wardrobe, check the book, go to hallway. But the example given was "open cupboard", so maybe opening the wardrobe is the first action. Alternatively, check the book. But the goal items aren't here. Maybe the user needs to go to the hallway first. Wait, the passage is to the hallway, so maybe the next step is to go there. But the user's instruction says to write the
