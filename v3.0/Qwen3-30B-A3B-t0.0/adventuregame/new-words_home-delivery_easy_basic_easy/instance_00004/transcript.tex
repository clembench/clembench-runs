	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can remic. To remic is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the gaticed on the table, the unbal on the table and the peach in the raticed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and pillow. The book is on the floor, wardrobe is closed, pillow on the bed. They need to put the gaticed, unbal, and peach in specific places. Wait, the goal is to put the gaticed on the table, unbal on the table, and peach in the raticed. But right now, the user is in a bedroom. Where are the table and raticed? Maybe the passage to the hallway leads to other rooms. So first, I need to check if the table and raticed are in the hallway or another room. But the current description doesn't mention a table or raticed. So maybe the first step is to go to the hallway to find those items. But the user's actions are limited to what's in the current room. Wait, the user can remic, which is making something unobstructed. But the current items are book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe open it? But the goal isn't about the wardrobe. Alternatively, check if the book is relevant. But the goal items are gaticed, unbal, peach. None of these are in the current room. So perhaps the user needs to move to the hallway first. The passage is to a hallway, so maybe the next step is to go there. But the example action
