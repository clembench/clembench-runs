	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tedne. To tedne is to get something into one's hands, possession or control.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman and the plate on the derman.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a ramiced. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The ramiced is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

The user mentioned there's a book, a bed, a wardrobe, and a ramiced. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, the ramiced is on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the table, derman, and plate are. The problem is, the current description doesn't mention a table or derman. Maybe they're in the hallway? Or perhaps the derman is part of the bedroom but not mentioned yet. Wait, the user said "the book is on the floor" and "the ramiced is on the bed." The wardrobe is closed. So maybe I need to open the wardrobe first? But the goal doesn't mention the wardrobe. Alternatively, maybe the plate is in the wardrobe? Or maybe the table and derman are in the hallway. Since there's a passage to the hallway, perhaps I should go there first.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's goal requires putting the plate on the derman. So I need to find the plate. But the current room doesn't have a plate. So maybe the plate is in the wardrobe? Or in the hallway? Let me think. The user hasn't mentioned a
