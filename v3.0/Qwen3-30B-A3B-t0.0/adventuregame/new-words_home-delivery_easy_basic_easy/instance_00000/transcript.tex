	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can maten. To maten is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the uness on the table, the potted plant on the cally and the peach on the cally.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and pillow. The book is on the floor, wardrobe is closed, pillow on the bed. Passage to hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal is to put the uness on the table, potted plant on the cally, and peach on the cally. Wait, but the current room doesn't mention a table, cally, or potted plant. Hmm. Maybe those items are in other locations. So first, I need to find those items.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the initial description doesn't have a table, cally, or potted plant. So maybe the user needs to go to the hallway? The passage is to a hallway. So maybe the next step is to go to the hallway to find the necessary items.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's first action should be to move to the hallway. So the action would be "go to hallway" or "go to the hallway". But the example given was "open cupboard", so maybe the action is "go to hallway".\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the user can interact with existing items. But the goal items aren't here. So the first step is to move to the hallway. Let me check the initial prompt again. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The passage is to a hallway. So the correct action is to go to the hallway. So the answer should be "> go to hallway".\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt >
