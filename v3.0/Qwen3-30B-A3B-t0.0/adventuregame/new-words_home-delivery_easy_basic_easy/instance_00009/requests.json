The goal is to put the ousnee on the table, potted plant on the delly, and peach on the delly. But first, I need to figure out where these items are.\n\nThe current description says the book is on the floor, wardrobe is closed, pillow on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway. So maybe the ousnee, potted plant, and peach are in the hallway? Or maybe the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed, maybe I need to open it first. But the user can also unalin, which makes something unobstructed. So perhaps the first step is to open the wardrobe or unalin it? Wait, the user can unalin, which is to make something physically unobstructed. So maybe the wardrobe is closed, so unalin it? But the example given was \"open cupboard\", so maybe \"open wardrobe\" is an action. But the user can also unalin. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's goal is to put certain items on specific places. But the current items in the room are book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The ousnee, potted plant, and peach aren't mentioned here. So maybe they are in the hallway? The passage to the hallway is here. So maybe the next step is to go to the hallway. But the user",
