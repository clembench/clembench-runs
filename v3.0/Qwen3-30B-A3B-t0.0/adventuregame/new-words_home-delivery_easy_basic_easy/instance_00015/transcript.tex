	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

To comess is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper and the broom on the comper.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a tuat now. There are a wardrobe, a bed, a pillow and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a room with a wardrobe, a bed, a pillow, a book, and a passage to a hallway. The goal is to put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper, and the broom on the comper. But first, I need to figure out where these items are.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the current description mentions a wardrobe, bed, pillow, book, and a passage. The items needed are lator, mop, broom. But none of these are mentioned here. So maybe the user needs to explore the hallway or other areas. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it would reveal something. Alternatively, the passage to the hallway might lead to other rooms where these items are located.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the user can comess, which is placing something somewhere, but they need to find the items first. The current room has a book on the floor. Maybe the lator, mop, and broom are in the wardrobe or in the hallway. The user should check the wardrobe first. Let me check the wardrobe. If the wardrobe is closed, they need to open it. So the first action would be to open the wardrobe. But the example given was "open cupboard," so maybe "open wardrobe" is the action here. Alternatively, check the hallway. But the user's goal is to put the items on specific places, so they need to find them first. So the first step is to
