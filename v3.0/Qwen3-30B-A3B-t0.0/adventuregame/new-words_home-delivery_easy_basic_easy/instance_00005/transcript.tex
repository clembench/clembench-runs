	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can perce. To perce is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the uner on the trion, the natin on the trion and the peach on the trion.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the "uner", "natin", and "peach" on the "trion". But first, I need to figure out where these items are. The current room is a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and pillow. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, and the pillow is on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the problem is that the items mentioned in the goal (uner, natin, peach, trion) aren't listed in the current description. So maybe they're in other locations. The user mentioned that "perce" is an action to make something unobstructed. Maybe I need to check the wardrobe or the bed? The wardrobe is closed, so perhaps opening it would reveal something. The pillow is on the bed, but maybe there's more under the bed? Also, the passage to the hallway might lead to other areas where these items are located.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first step is to open the wardrobe. Let me try that. If I open the wardrobe, maybe there's something inside. If not, maybe check under the bed or go to the hallway. But since the goal requires multiple items, I need to find each one. But the user's instruction says to write the single action. So the first action should be to open the wardrobe. Let's see.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open wardrobe
