The goal is to put the mical, mop, and broom on the pante. Wait, but right now, the items in the room are a book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The mical, mop, and broom aren't mentioned here. So maybe I need to check other locations. The passage is to a hallway. Maybe the hallway has those items? But the current description doesn't mention them. Alternatively, maybe the wardrobe contains them? The wardrobe is closed, so perhaps I need to open it first. Let me try opening the wardrobe to see if the items are inside. If not, then maybe check the hallway. But the user's first action should be to explore the available options. So the first step is to open the wardrobe.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe<|im_end|>",
