	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can inate. To inate is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the mical on the pante, the mop on the pante and the broom on the pante.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and pillow. The goal is to put the mical, mop, and broom on the pante. Wait, but right now, the items in the room are a book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. The mical, mop, and broom aren't mentioned here. So maybe I need to check other locations. The passage is to a hallway. Maybe the hallway has those items? But the current description doesn't mention them. Alternatively, maybe the wardrobe contains them? The wardrobe is closed, so perhaps I need to open it first. Let me try opening the wardrobe to see if the items are inside. If not, then maybe check the hallway. But the user's first action should be to explore the available options. So the first step is to open the wardrobe.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open wardrobe
