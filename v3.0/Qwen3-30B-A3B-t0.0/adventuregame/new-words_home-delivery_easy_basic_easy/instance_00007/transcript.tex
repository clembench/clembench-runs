	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can stism. To stism is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the nond on the table, the orange in the torish and the banana in the torish.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a torish, a book, a bed and a pillow. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a imped here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a torish (which is closed), a book on the floor, a bed with a pillow, and a passage to an imped. The goal is to put the nond on the table, the orange in the torish, and the banana in the torish. But wait, the current description doesn't mention a table, a nond, an orange, or a banana. Hmm, maybe the torish is a container, and the book, pillow, etc., are items that might be interacted with.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the necessary items are. The book is on the floor. Maybe the book contains the nond? Or perhaps the passage to the imped leads to other areas where these items are located. The user can stism, which is blocking an opening. So maybe the torish needs to be opened first. But the torish is closed. So the first step might be to open the torish. But the goal requires putting the orange and banana into the torish, so maybe the torish is a container that needs to be opened. However, the user hasn't found the orange or banana yet. Also, there's no table mentioned, so maybe the table is part of the imped area? Or perhaps the book is on the table? Wait, the book is on the floor. Maybe the table is elsewhere. But the user hasn't mentioned a table yet. This is confusing
