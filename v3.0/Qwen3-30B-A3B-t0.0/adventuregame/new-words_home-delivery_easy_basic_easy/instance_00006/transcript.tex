	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tratel. To tratel is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the unpish on the table, the plate on the secti and the mop on the secti.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a nolog now. There are a pillow, a bed, a unpish and a wardrobe. The pillow is on the bed. The unpish is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the unpish on the table, the plate on the secti, and the mop on the secti. But first, I need to figure out where everything is. The user is in a nolog with a pillow, bed, unpish, and wardrobe. The pillow is on the bed, unpish is on the floor, wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem mentions a table, secti, and a mop, but in the current room, there's no table mentioned. Maybe the table is in the hallway? Or maybe I need to find the plate and mop first. But the initial description doesn't mention a plate or mop. Hmm, maybe the user has to search the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it would reveal some items. But the goal includes a plate and mop, which aren't in the current room. So perhaps the first step is to open the wardrobe to check if those items are inside. Alternatively, maybe the passage to the hallway leads to other items. But the user's current location is the nolog. So maybe the first action is to open the wardrobe. Let me check the example again. The example action was "open cupboard". So similar here, maybe "open wardrobe". But the user's goal requires a plate and mop, which aren't here. So maybe the wardrobe has those items. Alternatively, maybe the plate and
