The passage is to a hallway, so maybe I should go there first. But the user's example actions include opening a cupboard, so maybe I need to open the wardrobe first? The wardrobe is closed. Maybe the plate or other items are inside the wardrobe?\n\nWait, the goal mentions a plate, but the initial description doesn't mention a plate. So perhaps the plate is in the wardrobe? Let me think.
