The book is on the floor, the subst is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the table, scont, and plate are. The problem is, the initial description doesn't mention a table or scont. Maybe they're in the hallway? Or perhaps the wardrobe needs to be opened to find them? The user mentioned that "scont" might be a typo, maybe "shelf" or "counter"? But I have to work with what's given.\\ \tt \\ \tt The subst is on the bed. So I need to take the subst and put it on the table. But where is the table? Maybe the table is in the hallway. The passage is to a hallway, so maybe I should go there first. But the user's example actions include opening a cupboard, so maybe I need to open the wardrobe first? The wardrobe is closed. Maybe the plate or other items are inside the wardrobe?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions a plate, but the initial description doesn't mention a plate. So perhaps the plate is in the wardrobe? Let me think. The user's goal requires putting the plate on the scont. So maybe the s
