	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

To ortid is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism and the plate on the alism.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a enerk. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The enerk is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism, and the plate on the alism. Wait, but the current room is a bedroom. The user mentioned there's a book, a bed, a wardrobe, and an enerk. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, the enerk is on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the table, alism, and plate are. The problem is, the initial description doesn't mention a table or alism. Maybe they're in the hallway? Or perhaps I need to find them by moving to the hallway. The passage to the hallway is here, so maybe I should go there first.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's goal requires placing items on the table and alism. Since the current room doesn't have a table, maybe the hallway has it. So the first step is to go to the hallway. Let me check the example given. The example action was "open cupboard," so maybe the user expects me to move to the hallway first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user said "You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a enerk. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The enerk is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here." So the passage is to the hallway.
