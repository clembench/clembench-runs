	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can prust. To prust is to get something into one's hands, possession or control.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the menny on the reele, the book on the reele and the plate on the reele.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a menny. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The menny is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the menny, the book, and the plate on the reele. But first, I need to find out where the reele is. The current location is a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and menny. The book is on the floor, the menny is on the bed, and the wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first step is probably to pick up the menny from the bed. Then the book from the floor. But where is the plate? It's not mentioned here. Maybe it's in the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed, I might need to open it. But the user hasn't mentioned a plate yet. Wait, the initial description says there's a book, bed, wardrobe, and menny. The plate isn't here. So maybe the plate is in the hallway? Or perhaps I need to check other locations. But the current room has a passage to the hallway. Maybe I should go to the hallway first to find the plate. But the goal requires putting the plate on the reele. But I don't know where the reele is. Maybe the reele is in another room. So, perhaps I need to explore the hallway first. But the user's example actions include opening a cupboard. So maybe I should check the wardrobe first. Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe opening it would reveal the plate?
