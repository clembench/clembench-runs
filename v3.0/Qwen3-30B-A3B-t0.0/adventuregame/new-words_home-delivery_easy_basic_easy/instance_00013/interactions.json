The current location is a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and menny. The book is on the floor, the menny is on the bed, and the wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\n\nSo, the first step is probably to pick up the menny from the bed. Then the book from the floor. But where is the plate? It's not mentioned here. Maybe it's in the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed, I might need to open it. But the user hasn't mentioned a plate yet. Wait, the initial description says there's a book, bed, wardrobe, and menny. The plate isn't here. So maybe the plate is in the hallway? Or perhaps I need to check other locations. But the current room has a passage to the hallway. Maybe I should go to the hallway first to find the plate. But the goal requires putting the plate on the reele. But I don't know where the reele is. Maybe the reele is in another room. So, perhaps I need to explore the hallway first. But the user's example actions include opening a cupboard. So maybe I should check the wardrobe first. Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe opening it would reveal the plate?",
