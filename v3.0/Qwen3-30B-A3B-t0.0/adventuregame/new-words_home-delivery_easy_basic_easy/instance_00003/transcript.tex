	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

To aphon is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord and the mop on the stord.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a enticed now. There are a wardrobe, a pillow, a bed and a decte. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The decte is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a room with a wardrobe, a pillow, a bed, and a decte. The goal is to put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord, and the mop on the stord. But first, I need to figure out what's available.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the current description says there's a wardrobe, pillow, bed, and decte. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The decte is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway. Hmm, but where are the plate and mop? They aren't mentioned here. Maybe they're in the hallway? Or maybe the user needs to go to the hallway first to find them. But the initial items listed don't include a plate or mop. So perhaps the user needs to check the hallway next. But the first step is to take the decte from the floor. The goal is to put the decte on the table. So the first action should be to pick up the decte. But wait, the user can aphon, which is placing something. But to place, they need to have it. So first, they need to take the decte. But the example given was "open cupboard," so maybe the action is "take decte." But the user's possible actions include aphon, which is placing. So maybe the first step is to
