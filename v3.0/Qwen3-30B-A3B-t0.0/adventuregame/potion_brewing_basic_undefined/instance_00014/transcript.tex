There's a passage to a reading room.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal is to brew a potion using the recipe. So first, I need to get the potion recipe. But the recipe is already on the bed. Wait, maybe the user needs to pick it up. But the example given was "open cupboard," so maybe the action here is to take the recipe. But the user might need to check the book first? Or maybe the recipe is already accessible. Since the recipe is on the bed, perhaps the first step is to take it. But the user might need to open the wardrobe to find ingredients? Or maybe the reading room has necessary items. But the passage is to the reading room. So possible actions: take potion recipe, open wardrobe, go to reading room, check book. But the example shows "open cupboard," so maybe the user needs to open the wardrobe first. But the wardrobe is closed. So maybe the first action is to open the wardrobe. Alternatively, take the potion recipe from the bed. But the user might need to read the recipe first. Wait, the book is on the bed. Maybe the book has instructions. But the potion recipe is also there. So maybe take the potion recipe first. But the user needs to pick it up. So the
