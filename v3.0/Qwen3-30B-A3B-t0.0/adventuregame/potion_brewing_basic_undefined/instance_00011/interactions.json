There's a passage to a reading room.\n\nSo, the first step is probably to pick up the potion recipe. Since it's on the bed, I can take it. Then, maybe the book? But the goal is the potion, so maybe the recipe is more important. Wait, the user can carry up to two items. So maybe take the recipe and another item. But what's needed for the potion? The recipe might list ingredients. But the user hasn't seen the recipe yet. So first, take the recipe. Then, check the wardrobe? Or the book? Or maybe the reading room has ingredients. But the passage is to the reading room. So maybe go there next. But first, take the recipe. Let me think. The example given was \"open cupboard\", so actions are verbs + nouns. So the first action should be to take the potion recipe. But the user is in the bedroom. So > take potion recipe. Then, maybe check the wardrobe. But the wardrobe is closed. So maybe open it.
