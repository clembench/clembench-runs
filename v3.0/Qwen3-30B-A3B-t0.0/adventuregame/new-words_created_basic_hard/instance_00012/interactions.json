There's also a passage to a \"gligiced.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the actions mean. The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, there are some special ones: eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet, and indiable. These might be verbs that aren't standard, so I need to use them appropriately.\n\nThe goal involves three parts: making the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust, and the loscred tibing. The words here are probably jumbled or have specific meanings in the game's context. Let's break them down.\n\n\"Rimess horpler\" â€“ maybe \"rimess\" is a noun, and \"horpler\" is a verb? Or maybe it's a compound word. Similarly, \"urermat ytoust\" and \"loscred tibing.\" Since the user has a urermat in the current room, maybe that's",
