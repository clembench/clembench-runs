	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet and indiable.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust and the loscred tibing.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a discroust now. There are a urermat, a eposper, a suncente, a conitity, a hidist and a loscred. There is a passage to a gligiced here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to perform specific actions to achieve their goal. The goal is to "Make the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust and the loscred tibing." The current location is a "discroust" with several items: a urermat, a eposper, a suncente, a conitity, a hidist, and a loscred. There's also a passage to a "gligiced."\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand what the actions mean. The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, there are some special ones: eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet, and indiable. These might be verbs that aren't standard, so I need to use them appropriately.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal involves three parts: making the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust, and the loscred tibing. The words here are probably jumbled or have specific meanings in the game's context. Let's break them down.\\ \tt \\ \tt "Rimess horpler" â€“ maybe "rimess" is a noun, and "horpler" is a verb? Or maybe it's a compound word. Similarly, "urermat ytoust" and "loscred tibing." Since the user has a urermat in the current room, maybe that's
