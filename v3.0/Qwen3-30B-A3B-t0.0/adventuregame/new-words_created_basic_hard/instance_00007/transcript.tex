	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can onser, mellum, clogery, ellous, ially and upbes.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the hetle anird, the ioness opige and the rotont reforian.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a atival now. There are a equadish, a rotont, a herper, a fervan, a thium and a ioness. There is a passage to a routiced here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the "hetle anird", "the ioness opige", and "the rotont reforian". The current room has a equadish, a rotont, a herper, a fervan, a thium, and a ioness. There's a passage to a routiced.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should figure out what each of these words mean. The goal is to perform actions that will achieve those three states. The possible actions include common ones plus some specific ones like onser, mellum, clogery, ellous, ially, and upbes. \\ \tt \\ \tt Starting with "Make the hetle anird". Maybe "anird" is a state that requires some action. Since "hetle" isn't a common word, perhaps it's a noun. Maybe I need to interact with the "herper" or "fervan"? Not sure. Alternatively, "anird" could be a verb, but the instruction is to make something anird. Maybe using an action like "onser" or "ellous" on the hetle? But I don't know what the hetle is. Wait, the current objects are equadish, rotont, herper, fervan, thium, ioness. Maybe "hetle" is a typo or a specific term. Alternatively, maybe "hetle" refers to one of these objects. Maybe "herper"
