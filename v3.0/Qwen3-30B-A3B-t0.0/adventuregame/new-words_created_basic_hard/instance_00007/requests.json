I need to make the \"hetle anird\", \"the ioness opige\", and \"the rotont reforian\". The current room has a equadish, a rotont, a herper, a fervan, a thium, and a ioness. There's a passage to a routiced.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each of these words mean. The goal is to perform actions that will achieve those three states. The possible actions include common ones plus some specific ones like onser, mellum, clogery, ellous, ially, and upbes. \n\nStarting with \"Make the hetle anird\". Maybe \"anird\" is a state that requires some action. Since \"hetle\" isn't a common word, perhaps it's a noun. Maybe I need to interact with the \"herper\" or \"fervan\"? Not sure. Alternatively, \"anird\" could be a verb, but the instruction is to make something anird. Maybe using an action like \"onser\" or \"ellous\" on the hetle? But I don't know what the hetle is. Wait, the current objects are equadish, rotont, herper, fervan, thium, ioness. Maybe \"hetle\" is a typo or a specific term. Alternatively, maybe \"hetle\" refers to one of these objects. Maybe \"herper\"",
