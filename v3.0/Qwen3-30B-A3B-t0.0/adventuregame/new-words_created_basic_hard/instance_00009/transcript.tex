	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can propress, atifory, alful, adcry, spidene and pnestay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the oubiced ecastic, the prachon dedulag and the mindly ropile.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a sinark now. There are a uncepist, a prachon, a ionity, a mindly, a epteria and a clednee. There is a passage to a conader here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to "Make the oubiced ecastic, the prachon dedulag and the mindly ropile." Hmm, those words are a bit strange. Maybe they're supposed to be real words but with some typos or alternate spellings? Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the current location is a "sinark." The items present are a "uncepist," "prachon," "ionity," "mindly," "epteria," and "clednee." There's a passage to a "conader." The possible actions include some unusual verbs like "propress," "atifory," "alful," "adcry," "spidene," and "pnestay." \\ \tt \\ \tt The goal is to make three things: "oubiced ecastic," "prachon dedulag," and "mindly ropile." Maybe each of these requires interacting with the objects present. Let's break them down.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting with "prachon dedulag." The user has a "prachon" in the room. Maybe they need to "dedulag" it? But "dedulag" isn't a standard verb. Alternatively, maybe "prachon" needs to be combined with another object. The other items are "uncepist," "ionity," "mindly
