	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the tulacy enerk, the menny soriced, and the ortid alism. The current room has a sioust, a menny, a ortid, a rist, a pacia, and a unflued. There's a passage to a penol.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should figure out what each of these actions means. The problem is that the verbs like latory, tedne, derman, tuate, chross, and sulphy aren't standard, so I need to infer their meanings based on the context or possible word roots.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the goal: "Make the tulacy enerk, the menny soriced and the ortid alism." The words "enerk," "soriced," and "alism" might be verbs or adjectives. Maybe "enerk" is a verb meaning to energize or something similar. "Soriced" could be a past tense of a verb, maybe "sorice" as in to make something sour? Or perhaps "soriced" is a state. Similarly, "alism" might be a state of being al.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the allowed actions include latory, tedne, derman, tuate, chross, sulphy, I need to map these to the required actions. Let's think about each action:\\ \tt \\ \tt - latory: Maybe "latory" is a typo for "l
