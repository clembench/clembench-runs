	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a riack, a siaticed, a astont, a teming, a eprour and a orele. There is a passage to a lablent here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the eprour reging, the siaticed degra, and the piesm ricke. The user is in a "lon" with several items: a riack, a siaticed, a astont, a teming, a eprour, and a orele. There's a passage to a lablent.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should figure out what each of these items might do. The goal involves three specific actions: making the eprour reging, the siaticed degra, and the piesm ricke. The possible actions include erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia, and crury, in addition to common ones.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting with the eprour. The word "reging" might be a typo or a game-specific term. Maybe "reign" or "regen"? If "reging" is a verb, perhaps I need to perform an action on the eprour. The eprour could be a noun, maybe a device or an object. Since there's a passage to a lablent, maybe the lablent is a place where certain actions can be performed. But the user is currently in a "lon," which might be a room or a location.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the items: siaticed, which might relate to "static" or "staged." The siaticed degra â€“
