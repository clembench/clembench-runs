	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a eleniced, a hooiced, a gicalio, a glogly, a alloger and a chophal. There is a passage to a itink here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a hydroft with several items: a eleniced, a hooiced, a gicalio, a glogly, a alloger, and a chophal. There's a passage to a itink. The goal is to make the chophal permity, the hooiced nionian, and the nousion nophyle. The allowed actions include some unusual ones like abluty, uningne, athemb, altric, polotit, and arimic.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand what each of these terms might mean. The goal involves making certain items have specific properties. For example, "make the chophal permity" â€“ maybe "permity" is a state or condition. Similarly, "hooiced nionian" and "nousion nophyle." The actions provided are probably verbs that can be applied to the items. \\ \tt \\ \tt Since the user is in a hydroft, maybe the passage to itink is a direction to move. But the initial action should be to interact with the items. The example given was "open cupboard," so maybe the user needs to perform actions on the objects present. \\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the items: chophal, hooiced, etc. The goal mentions chophal, hooiced, and nousion nophyle. So perhaps the user needs
