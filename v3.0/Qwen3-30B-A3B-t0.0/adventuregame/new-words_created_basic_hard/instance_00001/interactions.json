The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to \"Make the secti unpish, the rably nolog and the imped atory.\" Hmm, those words don't make much sense as regular English, but maybe they're part of the game's vocabulary. The user mentioned some actions like delly, heted, ousne, unalin, thoty, and ceous. I need to use those or the common actions.\n\nFirst, the current location is \"perced\" with a nond, a inet, a stism, a secti, a rably, and a torish. There's a passage to a uner. The goal is to modify the secti, rably, and imped. Maybe \"unpish\" means to make the secti not pish? But I don't know what pish is. Similarly, \"nolog\" for rably and \"atory\" for imped. Maybe the actions correspond to certain verbs. For example, \"delly\" might be a verb. Let me think.\n\nThe example given was \"open cupboard,\" so the actions are usually verbs followed by nouns. The user's goal is to perform actions that affect those specific objects. Since the user can't type full sentences, they need to pick the right action.
