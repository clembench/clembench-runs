	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can alitst, lophante, rhypnon, ophabor, ompous and hoadve.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal and the mituark mationymb.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a heccop now. There are a mituark, a inagness, a ctaticed, a otioct, a horbact and a asceles. There is a passage to a trapseng here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to make the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal, and the mituark mationymb. The current location is a heccop with several items: a mituark, a inagness, a ctaticed, a otioct, a horbact, and a asceles. There's a passage to a trapseng.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand the goal. The verbs like "make the rakeer skenic" might involve using the objects present. The allowed actions include some non-standard verbs like alitst, lophante, rhypnon, ophabor, ompous, and hoadve. But the user might need to use the objects in the room with these actions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the objects: mituark, inagness, ctaticed, otioct, horbact, asceles. The goal mentions "mituark mationymb" and "asceles tinhal". Maybe "mationymb" and "tinhal" are verbs or actions. So perhaps the user needs to perform actions on these objects.\\ \tt \\ \tt The passage to trapseng suggests moving there. But the initial step might be to interact with the objects. For example, using the mituark with some action. But what actions are possible? The allowed actions include alitst
