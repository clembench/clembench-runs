The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to \"Make the prolly lingly, the proark incry and the acion arliced.\" Hmm, those words don't make much sense, but maybe they're part of the game's specific vocabulary. The current location is \"distral\" with several objects: a arger, a proark, a shness, a rabish, a hypner, and a prolly. There's a passage to a comper.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what actions are possible. The user mentioned common actions like open, go, take, etc., plus some special verbs: seash, andect, lotis, belity, irear, deint. The goal is to perform actions that will make the prolly lingly, the proark incry, and the acion arliced. \n\nSo, the prolly is one of the objects here. Maybe \"make the prolly lingly\" means to perform an action on the prolly using one of the special verbs. Let's look at the verbs again. \"Lingly\" might be a typo or a game-specific term. Maybe \"ingly\" is part of a verb? Or perhaps it's a state to achieve. Similarly, \"incry\" and \"arliced\" are unclear. \n\nThe special verbs: seash, andect, lotis,",
