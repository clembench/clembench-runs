They seem like distorted or incorrect spellings of real words. Let's try to guess:\n\n- \"pholoiced\" might be \"phloxed\" or \"phosphored\"? Or maybe \"pholiated\"? Not sure.\n- \"connone\" could be \"connoisseur\" but that's longer. Maybe \"conno\" as a short form? Or \"conno\" as part of a word.\n- \"aeval\" might be \"aeval\" (but that's not a standard word) or \"aeval\" as a typo for \"aeon\" or \"eveal\"?\n- \"proggiced\" could be \"progressed\" or \"programmed.\"\n- \"rheably\" might be \"rheably\" (not a word) or \"rheably\" as a typo for \"rheably\" (maybe \"rheably\" is",
