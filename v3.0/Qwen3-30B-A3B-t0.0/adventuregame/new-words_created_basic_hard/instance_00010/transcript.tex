	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can udial, aterous, ingnus, ivess, ceorid and unmastic.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the pholoiced connone, the aeval proggiced and the rheably exsem.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a peroury now. There are a eical, a oidess, a pholoiced, a shromen, a aeval and a versch. There is a passage to a erove here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to achieve specific goals: make the "pholoiced connone," "aeval proggiced," and "rheably exsem." The current location is a "peroury" with several items: a "eical," "oidess," "pholoiced," "shromen," "aeval," and "versch." There's a passage to a "erove."\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand what these words might mean. They seem like distorted or incorrect spellings of real words. Let's try to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt - "pholoiced" might be "phloxed" or "phosphored"? Or maybe "pholiated"? Not sure.\\ \tt - "connone" could be "connoisseur" but that's longer. Maybe "conno" as a short form? Or "conno" as part of a word.\\ \tt - "aeval" might be "aeval" (but that's not a standard word) or "aeval" as a typo for "aeon" or "eveal"?\\ \tt - "proggiced" could be "progressed" or "programmed."\\ \tt - "rheably" might be "rheably" (not a word) or "rheably" as a typo for "rheably" (maybe "rheably" is
