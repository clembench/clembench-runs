	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a perent, a aciong, a inchan, a oming, a eucty and a strood. There is a passage to a stful here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to make the "strood aphistic," "aciong dolam," and "swaiced ailly." The current location is an "encal" with several objects: a perent, a aciong, a inchan, a oming, a eucty, and a strood. There's a passage to a "stful."\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand what each of these words might mean. The goal is to make certain things "aphistic," "dolam," and "ailly." Since these are not standard English words, they might be part of the game's terminology. Maybe "aphistic" relates to making something not artistic? Or perhaps it's a typo or a specific game term. Similarly, "dolam" and "ailly" could be specific actions or states.\\ \tt \\ \tt The available actions include common ones plus some unique ones like iscad, eriat, ovesis, mingne, setral, and lepht. The user needs to use these actions to achieve the goals. The objects present are perent, aciong, inchan, oming, eucty, strood. The passage leads to a stful.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first step is to interact with the objects. The user's goal involves the "strood," "aciong," and "swa
