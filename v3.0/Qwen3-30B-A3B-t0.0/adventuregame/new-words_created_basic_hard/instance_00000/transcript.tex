	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a subst, a pante, a sness, a eness, a inat and a mical. There is a passage to a unree here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's try to figure out what to do here. The user is in a text adventure game, and their goal is to "Make the inat mateny, the diale unsust and the subst dented." They mentioned some actions like mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic, and proar. The current location is a "cally" with several items: a subst, a pante, a sness, a eness, a inat, and a mical. There's a passage to a unree.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand what each of these terms might mean. The goal involves making three things: inat mateny, diale unsust, and subst dented. The actions available are a bit cryptic. Let's break them down.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's example action was "open cupboard," so the commands are likely verbs followed by nouns. The special actions listed (mator, unbal, etc.) might be verbs. For instance, "mator" could be a verb like "mator" (maybe "mater" but spelled differently?), "unbal" could be "unbalance," "gatic" might relate to "gatic" (like "gadget"?), "remic" could be "remic" (maybe "remake"?), "ratic" like "rational," and "proar" as "proar" (maybe "pro
