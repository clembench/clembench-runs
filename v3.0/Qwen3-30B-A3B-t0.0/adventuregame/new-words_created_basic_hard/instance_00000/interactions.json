The current location is a \"cally\" with several items: a subst, a pante, a sness, a eness, a inat, and a mical. There's a passage to a unree.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms might mean. The goal involves making three things: inat mateny, diale unsust, and subst dented. The actions available are a bit cryptic. Let's break them down.\n\nThe user's example action was \"open cupboard,\" so the commands are likely verbs followed by nouns. The special actions listed (mator, unbal, etc.) might be verbs. For instance, \"mator\" could be a verb like \"mator\" (maybe \"mater\" but spelled differently?), \"unbal\" could be \"unbalance,\" \"gatic\" might relate to \"gatic\" (like \"gadget\"?), \"remic\" could be \"remic\" (maybe \"remake\"?), \"ratic\" like \"rational,\" and \"proar\" as \"proar\" (maybe \"pro",
