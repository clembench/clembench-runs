The user is in an encal with a book, oroust, bed, wardrobe. The book is on the floor, oroust is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions "inchan" and "aciong". Maybe those are specific places. But the current description doesn't mention them. So maybe I need to go to the hallway to find them? Or perhaps the wardrobe is the inchan? Not sure. Let me check the items again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The oroust is on the bed. So I need to pick it up. Then put it in the inchan. But where is the inchan? Maybe the wardrobe? If the wardrobe is closed, maybe I need to open it first. The user can open the wardrobe. Then put the oroust inside. But the goal says "in the inchan", not sure. Alternatively, maybe the inchan is a different object. But the current description doesn't mention it. So maybe I need to go to the hallway to find the inchan. But the user hasn't mentioned that yet. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's first action should be to take the oroust from the bed. Then maybe go to the
