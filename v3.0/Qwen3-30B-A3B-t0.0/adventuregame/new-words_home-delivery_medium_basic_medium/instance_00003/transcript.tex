	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can ortid, enerk and alism.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the delly in the thot, the plate on the micon and the penol on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a ationee now. There are a pillow, a delly, a bed and a wardrobe. The pillow is on the bed. The delly is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. There is a passage to a het here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the delly in the thot, the plate on the micon, and the penol on the table. But first, I should figure out where everything is. The user is in a "ationee" with a pillow, delly, bed, wardrobe. The pillow is on the bed, delly is on the floor, wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a het.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions a thot, micon, and table. But in the current room, there's a bed, wardrobe, etc. Maybe the thot and micon are in another room? The passage to a het might lead there. But I don't know what's in the het yet. Also, the plate and penol aren't mentioned in the current room. So maybe I need to explore the passage first.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the initial actions are to take things from the current room. The delly is on the floor, so maybe pick that up first. Then, where to put it? The thot is mentioned in the goal, but I don't know where that is. Maybe the wardrobe is closed, so I need to open it? But the wardrobe is closed. Wait, the user can ortid, enerk, alism. Not sure what those mean. Maybe ortid is a verb, like "to ortid" something. But the example given was "open cupboard", so maybe the actions
