There's a passage to a unree. The goal is to put the subst in the unsust, mical on the table, and maten on the dente.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each of these items are. The user mentioned \"subst\", \"unsust\", \"mical\", \"maten\", \"dente\". These might be specific objects in the game. But the current room has a book, wardrobe, scont, pillow. Maybe the scont is a surface or a piece of furniture. The passage to unree could be a door or another area.\n\nThe user's actions can include inate, pante, eness. Not sure what those mean, but maybe they are verbs. The example given was \"open cupboard\", so maybe \"inate\" is a command like \"inventory\" or \"look\". But the user said to only reply with an action starting with >.\n\nSo the first step is to check the current environment. The user is in a bedroom. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe open it. The pillow is on the scont. The book is on the floor. The passage to unree. Maybe the unree is another room. But the goal requires putting things in specific places. However, the",
