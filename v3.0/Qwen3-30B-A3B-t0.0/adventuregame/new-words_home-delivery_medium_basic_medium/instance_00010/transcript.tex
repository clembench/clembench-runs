	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a atoust, a wardrobe, a bed and a pillow. The atoust is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a "crury" which I think might be a typo for "cubby" or maybe "cubbyhole"? Not sure, but the exact term might not matter. The key things here are the objects mentioned: a atoust, a wardrobe, a bed, a pillow. The atoust is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal is to put the atoust in the erack, the plecon on the stingly, and the mop on the stingly. Wait, but in the current room, there's no plecon or mop mentioned. The user mentioned a wardrobe, bed, pillow, and atoust. So maybe the other items are in other locations. But the user's current location is the crury. So first, I need to figure out where the plecon and mop are. But since the user hasn't mentioned them here, perhaps they are in the hallway? Or maybe the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it would reveal some items. But the user's current items are atoust, wardrobe, bed, pillow. So maybe the first step is to open the wardrobe to check if any of the required items are there. Alternatively, check the bed or the hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's first action should be to take an action. The possible actions include omante, precine, and
