But I don't see them in the initial description. Maybe they're hidden or part of the objects mentioned. Let me check again. The objects here are book, wardrobe, pillow, incry. Maybe \"incry\" is a typo for \"cabinet\" or \"chest\"? Or maybe \"arliced\" is a typo for \"article\" or \"slice\"? Similarly, \"comper\" could be \"compar\" or \"comper\" as a name. \"Comess\" might be \"comet\" or \"comest\" (like comestible). But I have to work with what's given.\n\nSince the user mentioned actions like \"acion\" (maybe \"action\"?), \"shness\" (maybe \"shininess\" or \"shness\" as a typo?), and \"arger\" (maybe \"larger\" or \"arger\" as a typo).
