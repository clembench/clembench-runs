	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the arliced in the atent, the comper on the table, and the comess on the distral. But first, I have to figure out where these items are. The user mentioned they're in a chross with a book, wardrobe, pillow, and incry. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, the pillow is on the incry, and there's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the items I need to move are arliced, comper, and comess. But I don't see them in the initial description. Maybe they're hidden or part of the objects mentioned. Let me check again. The objects here are book, wardrobe, pillow, incry. Maybe "incry" is a typo for "cabinet" or "chest"? Or maybe "arliced" is a typo for "article" or "slice"? Similarly, "comper" could be "compar" or "comper" as a name. "Comess" might be "comet" or "comest" (like comestible). But I have to work with what's given.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the user mentioned actions like "acion" (maybe "action"?), "shness" (maybe "shininess" or "shness" as a typo?), and "arger" (maybe "larger" or "arger" as a typo).
