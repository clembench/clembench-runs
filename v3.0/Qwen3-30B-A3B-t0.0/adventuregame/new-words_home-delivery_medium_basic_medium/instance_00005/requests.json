But first, I have to figure out where these items are. The user mentioned they're in a chross with a book, wardrobe, pillow, and incry. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, the pillow is on the incry, and there's a passage to a hallway.\n\nWait, the items I need to move are arliced, comper, and comess. But I don't see them in the initial description. Maybe they're hidden or part of the objects mentioned. Let me check again. The objects here are book, wardrobe, pillow, incry.
