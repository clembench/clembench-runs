The user is in a bedroom with a bed, wardrobe, pillow, and dermin. The wardrobe is closed, the pillow is on the bed, and the dermin is on the floor. There's a passage to a hypner here.\n\nWait, the goal mentions a deint, riat, and plate. But in the current room, there's a dermin, not a deint. Maybe the deint is in another location? The passage leads to a hypner, so maybe I should check there. Also, the plate and mop aren't mentioned here. So I need to explore the hypner to find those items. But the initial action should be to go to the hypner. Let me confirm: the user is in a bedroom, and the passage is to a hypner. So the first step is to go to the hypner. But the user's current location is the bedroom. So the action would be to go to the hypner. But the allowed actions include stfule, lotis, and andect. Wait, the user said that in addition to common actions, you can stfule, lotis, and andect. But the example given was \"open cupboard\". So maybe the common actions are like",
