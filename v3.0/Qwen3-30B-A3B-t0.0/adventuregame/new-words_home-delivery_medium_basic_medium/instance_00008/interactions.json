There's a passage to a olict.\n\nWait, the problem is that the current description doesn't mention the setral, lablent, eriat, iscad, mingnee, or olict. So maybe I need to explore more. The passage to a olict suggests there's another room. Maybe I should go there first. But the user's example actions include things like opening a cupboard. So maybe I need to open the ovesish? Or check the book? But the book is on the floor. Maybe the setral is in the book? Or the ovesish?\n\nAlternatively, the ovesish is closed, so perhaps opening it would reveal something. Let me try opening the ovesish first. If that doesn't work, maybe check the book. But the user's goal requires specific items. Since the current room doesn't have them, I need to look elsewhere. The passage to olict might lead to where the items are. So maybe go to the olict. But the action would be to",
