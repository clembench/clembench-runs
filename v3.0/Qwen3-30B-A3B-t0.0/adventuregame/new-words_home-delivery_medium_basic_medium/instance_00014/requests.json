But first, I should figure out where everything is.\n\nRight now, I'm in a bedroom. The items here are a book, a gicalio, a nophyle, and a chophal. The book is on the floor. The nophyle is on the gicalio. The chophal is closed. There's a passage to a hydroft.\n\nSo, the nophyle is on the gicalio. To put it in the chophal, I need to first get the nophyle. But the chophal is closed, so maybe I need to open it first. Wait, the user mentioned actions like ridism, hooic, and ditain. Not sure what those do, but maybe they're needed here.\n\nFirst, I should check if I can take the nophyle. But the nophyle is on the gicalio. So maybe I need to take the gicalio first? Or maybe take the nophyle directly. Let me think. If I can take the nophyle from the gicalio, then I can carry it to the chophal. But the chophal is closed, so I need to open it. Then put the nophyle inside.\n\nBut the problem",
