	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can ridism, hooic and ditain.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the nophyle in the chophal, the book on the matiorm and the eleniced on the matiorm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a gicalio, a nophyle and a chophal. The book is on the floor. The nophyle is on the gicalio. The chophal is closed. There is a passage to a hydroft here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the nophyle in the chophal, the book on the matiorm, and the eleniced on the matiorm. But first, I should figure out where everything is.\\ \tt \\ \tt Right now, I'm in a bedroom. The items here are a book, a gicalio, a nophyle, and a chophal. The book is on the floor. The nophyle is on the gicalio. The chophal is closed. There's a passage to a hydroft.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the nophyle is on the gicalio. To put it in the chophal, I need to first get the nophyle. But the chophal is closed, so maybe I need to open it first. Wait, the user mentioned actions like ridism, hooic, and ditain. Not sure what those do, but maybe they're needed here.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should check if I can take the nophyle. But the nophyle is on the gicalio. So maybe I need to take the gicalio first? Or maybe take the nophyle directly. Let me think. If I can take the nophyle from the gicalio, then I can carry it to the chophal. But the chophal is closed, so I need to open it. Then put the nophyle inside.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the problem
