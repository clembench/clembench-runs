	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can aling, vater and nogia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the secti in the imped, the inet on the table and the broom on the rably.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a pillow. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a nolog here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and pillow. The book is on the floor, wardrobe is closed, pillow on the bed. There's a passage to a nolog. The goal is to put the secti in the imped, inet on the table, and broom on the rably.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out what objects are available. The current items mentioned are book, bed, wardrobe, pillow. But the goal mentions secti, imped, inet, table, broom, rably. Hmm, maybe some of these are in the nolog passage? Since the user can go to the nolog.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first step is to check the nolog. The user might need to go there to find the necessary items. The available actions include moving to the nolog. So the first action should be to go to the nolog. But the user's current location is the bedroom. So the action would be to go to the nolog. But the user's instruction says to write the single action starting with >. So maybe > go to nolog. But the example given was "open cupboard". So maybe the action is "go to nolog". Alternatively, maybe "enter nolog" or "go to passage". Wait, the original description says "There is a passage to a nolog here." So perhaps the action is to go through the passage to the nolog.
