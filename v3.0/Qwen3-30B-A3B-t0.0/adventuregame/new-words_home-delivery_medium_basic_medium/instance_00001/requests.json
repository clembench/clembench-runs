First, I should figure out where each of these items is. The user mentioned they're in a room with a book, wardrobe, bed, and aphon. The book is on the floor, the wardrobe is closed, the aphon is on the bed. There's a passage to a hallway.\n\nSo, the first step is to get the aphon. Since it's on the bed, I should take it. Then I need to put it in the mator. But where is the mator? Maybe the wardrobe is the mator? Or maybe there's another object. Wait, the user mentioned a wardrobe, which is closed. Maybe the mator is the wardrobe? Or perhaps the passage to the hallway leads to the mator? Not sure. But the current room has a bed, so maybe the mator is somewhere else. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mator is the wardrobe. Let's try that. So first, take the aphon from the bed. Then go to the wardrobe and put it in. But the wardrobe is closed, so maybe I need to open it first. But the user's example had \"open cupboard\". So maybe the action is \"open wardrobe\". But the goal is to put the aphon in the mator.
