	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can itink, clogery and ambint.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the venism in the cunad, the book on the ciot and the plate on the ciot.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a book, a bed, a wardrobe and a venism. The book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The venism is on the bed. There is a passage to a toxist here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a bedroom with a book, bed, wardrobe, and venism. The goal is to put the venism in the cunad, the book on the ciot, and the plate on the ciot. Wait, but the current description mentions a passage to a toxist. Hmm, but the items mentioned are book, bed, wardrobe, venism. The plate isn't mentioned yet. Maybe the plate is in the wardrobe? Or maybe the cunad and ciot are somewhere else.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the venism is on the bed. So I need to take it. Then put it in the cunad. But where is the cunad? Maybe the wardrobe is the cunad? Or maybe the passage to toxist leads to another room with the cunad. But the user hasn't explored that yet. Alternatively, maybe "cunad" is a typo for "cabinet"? Similarly, "ciot" could be "cote" or "cote"? Not sure. But the user's actions are to put the venism in the cunad, book on the ciot, and plate on the ciot. So maybe the cunad is the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed. So perhaps open the wardrobe first. But the user's first action should be to take the venism from the bed. Then maybe go to the passage to toxist? Or check
