The cupboard is closed, and the plate is inside. They can go to a pantry or hallway. The goal is to put the potted plant on the table, book in the fridge, and mop in the wardrobe. But first, they need to find those items.\n\nCurrently, the plate is in the cupboard. Maybe the potted plant is somewhere else. Since the cupboard is closed, maybe opening it would reveal the plate, but the goal mentions a potted plant. So perhaps the plant is in another location. The user needs to explore. The passages are to pantry and hallway. Maybe check those areas. But the current room has a cupboard, counter, plate. Maybe the potted plant is on the counter? Or maybe in the pantry? Not sure. But the first step is to open the cupboard to get the plate. Wait, but the goal isn't to get the plate. The goal is to put the potted plant on the table. So maybe the plate isn't part of the goal. Wait, the user's goal is to put the potted plant on the table, book in the fridge, and mop in the wardrobe. So the items needed are potted plant, book, mop. The plate is in the cupboard, but that's not part of the goal. So maybe the user needs to find the potted plant, book, and mop",
