	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a living room with a couch, table, chair, and side table. There's a passage to a hallway. The goal is to put the pillow in the fridge, book in the wardrobe, and plate on the shelf. First, I need to figure out where each of these items might be.\\ \tt \\ \tt The pillow is probably on the couch. So the first step would be to take the pillow. Then, go to the refrigerator. But wait, the user can only carry two items at a time. So after taking the pillow, they might need to go to the fridge, put it in, then go back for the next item. But the fridge might not be in the living room. The passage is to a hallway, maybe the fridge is there? Not sure. Alternatively, the book could be on the table or the side table. The plate might be on the table as well. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, check the couch for the pillow. Take the pillow. Then, go to the hallway (since the passage is there). Maybe the fridge is in the hallway. Then put the pillow in the fridge. Then return to the living room. Next, take the book from the table or somewhere. Then go to the wardrobe, which might be in the hallway or another room. Then put the book in the wardrobe. Then take the plate from the table, go to the shelf (maybe the shelf is in the living room or
