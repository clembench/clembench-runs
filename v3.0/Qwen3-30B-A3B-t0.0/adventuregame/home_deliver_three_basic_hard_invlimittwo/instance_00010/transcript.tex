	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the potted plant on the side table, the book in the refrigerator and the plate on the shelf.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a kitchen now. There are a cupboard, a table, a counter and a plate. The cupboard is closed. The plate is in the cupboard. There are passages to a pantry, a living room and a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the potted plant on the side table, the book in the refrigerator, and the plate on the shelf. But first, I have to figure out where everything is. The user is in a kitchen with a cupboard, table, counter, and a plate. The cupboard is closed, and the plate is inside. There are passages to a pantry, living room, and hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions a potted plant, but I don't see it mentioned here. Maybe it's in another location? The current room has a plate in the cupboard. So maybe I need to open the cupboard first to get the plate. But the plate is already in the cupboard. Wait, the user says "the plate is in the cupboard." So maybe I need to take the plate from the cupboard. But the cupboard is closed. So first action should be to open the cupboard. Then take the plate. But the goal is to put the plate on the shelf. So after taking the plate, I need to go to a shelf. But where is the shelf? The current room has a table, counter, etc. Maybe the shelf is in another room. But the passages are to pantry, living room, hallway. Maybe the shelf is in one of those. But I don't know yet. Alternatively, maybe the counter or table has a shelf. But the description says "table, a counter and a plate." Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait,
