Both are on the floor. The exit is a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the goal items aren't here. So I need to find them. Maybe the hallway has the pillow, book, and plate? But I can only carry two items at a time. So I should check the hallway first. Let me go there. Wait, the passage is to the hallway. So I should go through that. But I need to pick up the mop or broom first? Or maybe the items are in the hallway. Let me check the hallway. But I can't do that yet. So first, maybe take the mop or broom. But the goal is to get the pillow, book, and plate. Maybe the hallway has those. But I need to move to the hallway first. So the first action is to go to the hallway. But the user's example had "open cupboard" as an action. So maybe the action is to go through the passage. But how? The passage is to the hallway. So maybe the action is "go to hallway" or "enter hallway". But the user's example uses "open cupboard". So maybe the action is "go through passage" or "enter hallway". Wait, the user's
