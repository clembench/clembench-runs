	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table and the mop on the shelf.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a book, a table and a chair. The book is on the table. There are passages to a bedroom and a kitchen here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table, and the mop on the shelf. But first, I have to find those items. The user is in a living room with a couch, book, table, chair. The book is on the table. Passages to bedroom and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the apple might be in the kitchen, maybe on the table there? The plate could be in the kitchen as well, or maybe in the living room. The mop is probably in a storage area, maybe the bedroom or a closet. But the current room is the living room. Let me check the objects here. The book is on the table. Maybe I need to pick up the book first? Wait, but the goal is to put other items. Wait, the user can carry up to two objects. So maybe I need to look for the apple, plate, and mop.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the passages are to bedroom and kitchen, maybe I should go to the kitchen first. Let me try going to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, I might find the apple and plate. Then take them, then go to the freezer. Then go to the bedroom to find the mop. But I need to make sure I don't drop anything. Let me start by moving to the kitchen.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > go to kitchen
