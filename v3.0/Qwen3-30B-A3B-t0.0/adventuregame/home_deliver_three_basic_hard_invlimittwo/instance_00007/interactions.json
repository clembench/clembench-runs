But first, I need to figure out what's available here.\n\nWait, the current room has a wardrobe that's closed. The pillow is in the wardrobe. So maybe I should open the wardrobe first. But the user can only carry two items. The wardrobe might have other things, but right now the pillow is there. But the goal items are potted plant, plate, mop. None of those are here yet. So maybe the next step is to go to the hallway? Or maybe check if there's anything else in the bedroom. But the description says only bed, wardrobe, pillow. So perhaps the wardrobe needs to be opened to get the pillow, but the pillow isn't part of the goal. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's inventory can hold two items. So maybe the first step is to open the wardrobe to get the pillow, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe the passage to the hallway is the way to go.
