The goal is to put the broom on the shelf, the potted plant on the counter, and the plate in the wardrobe. But first, I need to find those items. Right now, I'm in the living room with a couch, book, chair, and side table. The book is on the side table. The passages lead to bedroom, kitchen, and hallway.\n\nSo, the first step is probably to pick up the book since it's here. But wait, the items needed for the goal aren't in the living room. The broom, potted plant, and plate must be elsewhere. Maybe I need to explore other rooms. Let's check the possible directions. The passages are to bedroom, kitchen, and hallway. Let's start with the bedroom. Maybe the broom is there? Or the potted plant? Alternatively, the kitchen might have a plate. But I don't know yet. I should move to one of those rooms. Let's try the bedroom first. So the action would be to go to the bedroom. But the user's example had \"open cupboard,\" so maybe the action is to go somewhere. Wait, the user said \"passages to a bedroom, a kitchen and a hallway here.\" So the possible actions are to go to those places. But the user's example uses commands like \"open,\" but maybe here the action is to move. But the initial instruction says to write the single action",
