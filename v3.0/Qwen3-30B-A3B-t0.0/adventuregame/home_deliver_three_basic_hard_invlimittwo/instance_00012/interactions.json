But first, they need to find those items.\n\nThe current location has a potted plant, and passages to a broom closet, kitchen, and living room. So maybe the broom is in the broom closet. The pillow and plate might be in other rooms. But the user can only carry two items at a time. So they need to plan which items to pick up first.\n\nThe first step is to check the broom closet. Let's start there. So the action would be to go to the broom closet. Wait, but the user's action should be to take the broom. But maybe they need to open the closet first. However, the example given was \"open cupboard,\" so maybe the user can directly take the broom if it's inside. But the description says \"You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\" So the user needs to collect the broom first. But the initial prompt doesn't mention the broom being in the hallway. So the user needs to go to the broom closet. So the first action should be to go to the broom closet. But the user's action is to take an action, like \"go to broom closet\" or \"open broom closet",
