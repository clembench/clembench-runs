The goal is to put the sandwich in the freezer, the plate on the shelf, and the mop on the table. But first, I need to figure out what's available here.\n\nWait, the current items mentioned are the bed, wardrobe, pillow. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe I need to open it to get the pillow. But the goal items are sandwich, plate, mop. None of those are in the bedroom yet. So maybe the next step is to go to the hallway and look for those items. But the user's current location is the bedroom. So the first action should be to open the wardrobe to get the pillow? But the goal doesn't mention the pillow. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's inventory can hold up to two objects. So maybe the pillow is needed later? Or maybe the wardrobe has other items. But the description says the pillow is in the wardrobe. So perhaps opening the wardrobe is the first step. But the user's goal is about sandwich, plate, mop. Maybe the hallway has those items. So maybe the first action is to go to the hallway. But the user is in the bedroom, and there's a passage to the hallway. So the action would be to go to the hallway. But the example given was \"",
