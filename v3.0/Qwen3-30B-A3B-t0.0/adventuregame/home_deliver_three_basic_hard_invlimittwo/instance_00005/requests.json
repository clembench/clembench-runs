I need to put the sandwich in the freezer, the book in the wardrobe, and the mop on the table. But first, I'm in a broom closet with a mop and a broom. The goal is to collect those items and place them correctly.\n\nWait, the current location is a broom closet. The user mentioned that I can have up to two objects in my inventory. So, I need to pick up items one by one. The mop is on the floor here. Since the goal requires putting the mop on the table, maybe I should pick up the mop first. But I also need to check if there's a sandwich and a book here. However, the description only mentions the mop and broom in the closet. So maybe the sandwich and book are in other locations.\n\nBut the initial step is to take the mop. Let me check the example given. The example action was \"open cupboard,\" so maybe I need to pick up the mop. But the user's instruction says to write the single action starting with \">\". So, the first action should be to take the mop. But wait, the broom is also here. However, the goal is to put the mop on the table, so maybe I need to take the mop first. But the broom is also on the floor. But the user can only carry two items. So perhaps take the mop first. Let me confirm: the current room has a mop",
