The user mentioned they're in a pantry with a sandwich, peach, refrigerator, freezer, orange, banana, apple. The sandwich, peach, orange, banana, apple are all in the refrigerator, which is closed. The freezer is also closed. There's a passage to the kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the potted plant isn't mentioned here. Maybe it's in the kitchen? Or maybe I need to check other locations. But the current location is the pantry. So maybe I need to open the refrigerator first to get the orange, banana, etc. But the goal is to put the orange on the table. So perhaps I need to take the orange from the refrigerator, then put it on the table. But first, I need to open the refrigerator. Let me start by opening the refrigerator. Then I can take the orange. But the user's inventory can hold two items. So maybe take the orange and another item? But the goal is to put the orange on the table, so maybe take the orange first. Then go to the kitchen and put it on the table. But the passage is to the kitchen. So first, open the refrigerator, take the orange, then go to the kitchen, then put it on the table.
