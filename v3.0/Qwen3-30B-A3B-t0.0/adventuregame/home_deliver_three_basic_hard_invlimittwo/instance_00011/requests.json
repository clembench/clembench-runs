The user is in a living room with a couch, shelf, chair, and side table. They can go to a bedroom, kitchen, or hallway. The goal is to put the book on the shelf, sandwich on the table, and broom on the counter.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where each item is. The current room is the living room. The shelf is here, so maybe the book is here. But the sandwich and broom might be in other rooms. Wait, the user can only carry two items at a time. So they need to pick up one item, place it, then go get another.\n\nBut the initial description doesn't mention the book, sandwich, or broom. So maybe they're in the room. Let me check again. The user says \"You can perceive in the game\" but the description only lists the furniture. Hmm, maybe the items are in the room. Let me assume that. So the book is on the couch or chair? The sandwich on the side table? The broom in the hallway? Not sure. But the user needs to find them.\n\nBut the user's first action should be to look around or check the objects. Wait, the example given was \"open cupboard,\" but here there's no cupboard mentioned. Maybe the user needs to pick up items. But how? Maybe the book is on the shelf? Wait, the goal is to put the book on the shelf",
