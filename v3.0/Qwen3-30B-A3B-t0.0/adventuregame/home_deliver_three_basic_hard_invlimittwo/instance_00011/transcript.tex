	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the book on the shelf, the sandwich on the table and the broom on the counter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a shelf, a chair and a side table. There are passages to a bedroom, a kitchen and a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a living room with a couch, shelf, chair, and side table. They can go to a bedroom, kitchen, or hallway. The goal is to put the book on the shelf, sandwich on the table, and broom on the counter.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where each item is. The current room is the living room. The shelf is here, so maybe the book is here. But the sandwich and broom might be in other rooms. Wait, the user can only carry two items at a time. So they need to pick up one item, place it, then go get another.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the initial description doesn't mention the book, sandwich, or broom. So maybe they're in the room. Let me check again. The user says "You can perceive in the game" but the description only lists the furniture. Hmm, maybe the items are in the room. Let me assume that. So the book is on the couch or chair? The sandwich on the side table? The broom in the hallway? Not sure. But the user needs to find them.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's first action should be to look around or check the objects. Wait, the example given was "open cupboard," but here there's no cupboard mentioned. Maybe the user needs to pick up items. But how? Maybe the book is on the shelf? Wait, the goal is to put the book on the shelf
