You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister.\nYour opponent's team words are: colonel, gold, bank, street, ladies, fun, couple, record.\nDistractor words are: bar, sir, mom, news, plane, country, order.\nThe kill words are: kind.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister. The opponent's words are colonel, gold, bank, street, ladies, fun, couple, record. Distractors are bar, sir, mom, news, plane, country, order. Kill word is kind.\n\nFirst, I should look for a word that can connect multiple of my team's words. Let me list out my team words again: friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister. Maybe think of categories or themes. \n\n\"Friend\" and \"sister\" and \"dad\" are all family or people. \"Difference\" could relate to something like \"contrast\" or \"variance\". \"Report\" might be related to \"news\" but news is a distractor. \"Accident\" could be a \"mistake\" or \"incident\". \"Middle\" is a position. \"Drink\" is a beverage. \"Age\" is time. \n\nWait, the clue can't be any of the words in the list or parts of them. So, for example, \"family\" could relate to dad, sister, friend (as in friend of the family?), but not sure. \"Middle\" could be part of \"middle age\", but \"age\" is a target. Maybe \"middle",
