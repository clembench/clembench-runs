You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: asp, radish, chemistry, apple, mesa, garlic, hallway, anatomy, teacher.\nYour opponent's team words are: rattlesnake, geology, glacier, mustard, copperhead, potato, window, cashier.\nDistractor words are: turnip, parsley, foundation, valley, green, evergreen, doctor.\nThe kill words are: door.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are asp, radish, chemistry, apple, mesa, garlic, hallway, anatomy, teacher. The opponent's words are rattlesnake, geology, glacier, mustard, copperhead, potato, window, cashier. Distractors are turnip, parsley, foundation, valley, green, evergreen, doctor. Kill word is door.\n\nFirst, I should look for words that have multiple meanings or can be associated with different things. The clue needs to be a single word that's semantically related to some of my team's words but not any of the others. Let me list my team words again: asp (could be a snake or a type of tree?), radish (vegetable), chemistry (science), apple (fruit), mesa (geographical feature), garlic (herb), hallway (part of a building), anatomy (body structure), teacher (occupation).\n\nLooking for possible overlaps. For example, \"teacher\" could relate to \"anatomy\" if it's a teacher of anatomy. But maybe not. \"Chemistry\" and \"anatomy\" both are sciences. \"Mesa\" and \"valley\" are geographical terms, but valley is a distractor. \"Apple\" and \"radish\" are both vegetables? Wait, apple is a fruit, radish is a vegetable. Maybe",
