You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite.\nYour opponent's team words are: hurdler, assassinator, emotionality, liquidness, bagpiper, deinstitutionalization, housewifery, perpetration.\nDistractor words are: bandmaster, ladylove, customizer, defenseman, narrowness, hotelkeeper, neckband.\nThe kill words are: seacoast.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are: eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or connections among these words. Let me go through each one:\n\n- Eggroll: A food item, a type of spring roll.\n- Scrubwoman: A female scrubber, maybe someone who cleans?\n- Plantain: A type of banana, also a food.\n- Banquette: A bench, often in a restaurant.\n- Muddiness: The state of being muddy, unclear.\n- Unchallenging: Not difficult, easy.\n- Moviemaker: Someone who makes movies, director or producer.\n- Hypersensitivity: Excessive sensitivity, like an allergy.\n- Typewrite: To write with a typewriter, or the act of typing.\n\nLooking for connections. Maybe some of these words are related to food? Eggroll and plantain are foods. But scrubwoman, banquette, etc., don't fit. Maybe not food.\n\nAnother angle: parts of speech? Not sure. Maybe verbs vs nouns. But the clue needs to be a single word related to multiple targets.\n\nLooking for synonyms or broader categories. For example, \"sensitivity\" could relate to hypersensitivity, but not sure",
