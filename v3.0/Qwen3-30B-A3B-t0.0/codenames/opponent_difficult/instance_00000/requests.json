You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: missile, button, cap, time, novel, straw, server, himalayas, spy.\nYour opponent's team words are: ice, car, shot, piano, lion, bank, fork, strike.\nDistractor words are: beach, gold, bridge, whip, pumpkin, change, bill.\nThe kill words are: space.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are missile, button, cap, time, novel, straw, server, himalayas, spy. The opponent's words are ice, car, shot, piano, lion, bank, fork, strike. Distractors are beach, gold, bridge, whip, pumpkin, change, bill. And the kill word is space.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which of my team words can be connected by a common theme. Let me list them again: missile, button, cap, time, novel, straw, server, himalayas, spy. Hmm. Maybe some of these can be linked through different categories. For example, \"cap\" could be a noun or a verb. \"Button\" is a part of clothing or a control. \"Server\" could be a computer server or someone who serves. \"Time\" is a concept. \"Novel\" is a book. \"Straw\" is a drink tube or a material. \"Missile\" is a weapon. \"Himalayas\" is a mountain range. \"Spy\" is a secret agent.\n\nLooking for a single word that can connect multiple of these. Let's think of synonyms or related terms. For example, \"cap\" and \"button\" could both be parts of a uniform. But \"server\" doesn't fit. Alternatively, \"time\"",
