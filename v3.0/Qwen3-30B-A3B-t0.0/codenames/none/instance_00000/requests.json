You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: olive, mammoth, post, grace, superhero, dance, laser, pool, spring.\nYour opponent's team words are: play, cotton, unicorn, europe, bill, scale, nurse, chocolate.\nDistractor words are: charge, genius, mexico, paper, pound, circle, phoenix.\nThe kill words are: kiwi.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: olive, mammoth, post, grace, superhero, dance, laser, pool, spring. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, it should be semantically related. The goal is to have my partner guess all the target words, but if they guess an opponent's or distractor, their turn ends. If they guess the kill word (kiwi), we lose.\n\nFirst, I should look for a word that can connect multiple team words. Let me list the team words again: olive, mammoth, post, grace, superhero, dance, laser, pool, spring. Let me think of possible categories or themes.\n\nOlive could relate to color (green), or maybe a type of tree. Mammoth is a big animal, or a large thing. Post could be a verb or a noun, like a pole or a position. Grace is elegance, a name, or a term in sports. Superhero is a character. Dance is an activity. Laser is a beam of light. Pool is a body of water or a game. Spring is a season or a coil.\n\nLooking for a common theme. Maybe \"big\"? But mammoth is big, but others like olive, post, etc., not sure. \"Light\"? Laser is light, but others? Maybe not. \"Action\"? Super",
