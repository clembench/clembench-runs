	 Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below. You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\\ \tt The goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\\ \tt The more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Always give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: <WORD>\\ \tt TARGETS: <TARGETS>\\ \tt \\ \tt Your team words are: sound, revolution, plane, seal, light, file, ghost, bomb, gas.\\ \tt Your opponent's team words are: hawk, mount, war, orange, part, mint, ruler, grace.\\ \tt Distractor words are: ground, microscope, alien, witch, washer, china, pyramid, plot.\\ \tt The kill words are: .

The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, the clue should be semantically related to the target words.

If they guess a kill word, we lose immediately.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the team words and think of a common theme. Let's list them again: sound, revolution, plane, seal, light, file, ghost, bomb, gas. Hmm. What do these have in common? Let's see:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Sound, light, gas, bomb, plane, seal, file, revolution, ghost. Maybe some of them can be related to "air"? Wait, gas is a state of matter, but not sure. Or maybe "sound" and "light" are both forms of energy. But that might not cover others. Alternatively, think of words that can be nouns and verbs. For example, "file" can be a noun or a verb (to file a document). "Plane" can be a noun (airplane) or a verb (to plane a surface). "Seal" can be a noun or a verb (to seal a letter).
