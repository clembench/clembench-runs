You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum.\nYour opponent's team words are: scotland, brandy, poland, canada, india, vodka, poplar, oak.\nDistractor words are: running, river, mesa, track, skiing, glacier, cave.\nThe kill words are: dresser.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum. The opponent's words are Scotland, brandy, Poland, Canada, India, vodka, poplar, oak. Distractors are running, river, mesa, track, skiing, glacier, cave. And the kill word is dresser.\n\nFirst, I should figure out possible connections among my team's words. Let's list them again: teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum. Hmm. Maybe some of these are parts of the body? Teeth, kidney, elbow, chest. But also, some are musical instruments: violin, cymbal, drum. Then there are religious positions: archbishop, deacon. Maybe there's a theme here. Alternatively, think of synonyms or categories.\n\nWait, the clue has to be a single word that's semantically related to some of the target words. Let me think of possible words that can link multiple targets. For example, \"joint\" could relate to elbow, but not sure about others. \"Instrument\" relates to violin, cymbal, drum. But maybe \"musical\" but that's not a single word. Wait, the clue has to be a single word. Let me think of",
