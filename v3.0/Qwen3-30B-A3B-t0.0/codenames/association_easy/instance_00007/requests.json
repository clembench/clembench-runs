You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey.\nYour opponent's team words are: ska, tequila, wine, alternative, martini, kale, zucchini, rock.\nDistractor words are: guitar, plum, lime, banana, apricot, cello, harmonica.\nThe kill words are: hiv.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, the clue should be semantically related to the target words. The goal is to have my partner guess all the words, but if they guess an opponent's, distractor, or kill word, we lose.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or categories among my team's words. Let's list them again: skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey. Hmm. Some of these might relate to sports or activities. Skiing, hockey, train (maybe train as in a sport? Not sure). Then there's jacks, which is a game. Socks, vest, maybe clothing? Bronze and platinum are metals or awards. Gun and train... Maybe not. Alternatively, think of other connections.\n\nWait, \"jacks\" could be the game with the jacks, but also \"jacks\" as in the game of knucklebones. Socks and vest are clothing items. Bronze and platinum are metals, but also colors? Or maybe they're related to awards (like Olympic medals: bronze, silver, gold). But platinum isn't an Olympic medal. Wait, the team words include bronze, platinum,",
