You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: server, school, hood, alien, knife, pole, figure, tube, oil.\nYour opponent's team words are: shoe, triangle, microscope, fish, turkey, whale, giant, strike.\nDistractor words are: octopus, revolution, agent, club, sock, smuggler, cold.\nThe kill words are: bat.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: server, school, hood, alien, knife, pole, figure, tube, oil. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, it should be semantically related. Let me think about each word and see if there's a common theme.\n\nFirst, server. That could relate to a computer server or a person serving food. School is a place for learning. Hood could be a part of a car or a neighborhood. Alien is an extraterrestrial. Knife is a tool. Pole is a long stick. Figure could be a shape or a person. Tube is a cylindrical object. Oil is a liquid.\n\nLooking for connections. Maybe \"stick\"? Let's see. A pole is a stick. A knife has a blade, but not sure. A tube is like a stick? Maybe. But not sure. What about \"shape\"? Figure is a shape, but others? Not sure. \"Object\"? Too generic. \"Tool\"? Knife is a tool, but others? Maybe not. \"Body\"? Hood could be part of a car, but not sure. \n\nWait, \"school\" could be a group of fish, but that's an opponent's word. Maybe \"group\"? School is a group, but others? Hood? Not sure. \"Line\"? Pole could be a line, but not sure",
