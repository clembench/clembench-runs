You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack.\nYour opponent's team words are: boom, squash, count, pit, shock, pawn, hitch, nip.\nDistractor words are: pipe, strand, strip, crash, spill, rib, vault.\nThe kill words are: fry.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack. The clue can't be any of these words or parts of them. Also, the clue should be semantically related to the target words. The goal is to have my partner guess all the words, but if they guess an opponent's or distractor word, the turn ends, and if they guess a kill word (fry), the game ends.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the team words and find a common theme. Let's list them again: slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack. Hmm. Some of these are nouns, some verbs. Let's think of possible categories.\n\nSlack can mean looseness or a period of inactivity. Glare is a harsh light or a look. Beetle is an insect. Blow is a gust of wind or a hit. Stall is to delay or a place for animals. Plot is a plan or a piece of land. Cramp is a muscle spasm or a tight space. Rush is a quick movement or a crowd. Smack is a hit or a loud sound.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Maybe actions or verbs? But some are nouns. Alternatively, think of synonyms or related concepts. Let's see. \"Blow\" and",
