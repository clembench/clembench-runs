You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: jig, peck, plump, toast, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill.\nYour opponent's team words are: stripe, pool, rubber, pad, clutch, stable, mint, lean.\nDistractor words are: corn, boil, bridge, strain, sap, rail, jumper.\nThe kill words are: file.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: jig, peck, plump, toast, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill. The opponent's words are stripe, pool, rubber, pad, clutch, stable, mint, lean. Distractors are corn, boil, bridge, strain, sap, rail, jumper. And the kill word is file.\n\nFirst, I should look at my team's words and think about possible common themes or categories. Let's list them again: jig, peck, plump, toast, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill. \n\nHmm. Jig can be a dance or a type of fish. Peck is a small amount or a bird's action. Plump means full or round. Toast is bread or a celebration. Pry is to force open. Seal is a creature or to close. Hitch is a problem or a connection. Truck is a vehicle or to carry. Drill is a tool or to practice.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Maybe verbs? Some of these are verbs: peck, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill. But others are nouns. Alternatively, think of synonyms or related concepts. \n\nAnother angle: think of words that can have multiple meanings. For example, \"seal\" can be a noun or verb. \"Truck\" as a verb means to carry. \"Dr",
