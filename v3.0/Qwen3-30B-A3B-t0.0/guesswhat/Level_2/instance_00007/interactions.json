The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Gardenia', 'Lilac', 'Pansy', 'Violet', 'Bee', 'Ant', 'Centipede', 'Millipede']",

The words are Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet, Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. The words include flowers and insects. Wait, Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet are all flowers. Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede are insects or related. So maybe the first question could be: \"Is the word a flower?\" If yes, then it's one of the first four. If no, then the insects.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or spelling, but asking if it's a flower is okay because it's a general characteristic. So that's a valid first question.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then I have four options. Then I need to narrow down further. Maybe next question: \"Is the word a type of plant?\" But wait, all flowers are plants. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, check for specific features. But since I can't ask about structure, maybe think of other attributes.\n\nAlternatively, after confirming it's a flower, maybe ask about color. But the question has to be yes/no. For example, \"Is the word associated with the color purple?\" Violet is purple, but Gardenia",
