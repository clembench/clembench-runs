	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Lawyer', 'Attorney', 'Clerk', 'Salesperson', 'Screwdriver', 'Awl', 'Knife', 'Axe']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson, Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I have to focus on meanings or uses.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe start with something like "Is the word a profession?" That would separate the jobs from the tools. Let's check: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson are professions. Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe are tools. So if the answer is yes, then the target is one of the first four. If no, then among the tools.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user said only one question per turn. So first question: "Is the word a profession?" Let's say the answer is yes. Then I have four options. Next, maybe ask about specific roles. Like "Is the word a legal professional?" That would narrow down Lawyer and Attorney. But maybe there's a better way.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, if the first question is about tools vs. people. But maybe another approach. Let me think. Another possible question: "Is the word a tool?" If yes, then the answer is among Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. If no, then among the professions.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user might have a
