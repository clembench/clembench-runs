	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Canoe', 'Skiff', 'Battleship', 'Destroyer', 'Flood', 'Earthquake', 'Typhoon', 'Tornado']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Canoe, Skiff, Battleship, Destroyer, Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon, Tornado.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. The words include both water vessels and natural disasters. Wait, Canoe and Skiff are small boats. Battleship and Destroyer are ships. Then Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon, Tornado are natural disasters. So maybe the first question could be about whether the word is a type of boat or a natural disaster. But the user said the questions can't be about structure or spelling, but they can be about general categories. So maybe:\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the target word a type of boat?\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then the possible words are Canoe, Skiff, Battleship, Destroyer. If no, then Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon, Tornado. That splits the list into two groups of four. Then next question would depend on the answer.\\ \tt \\ \tt But maybe there's a better way. Let's think. Another approach: check if it's a natural disaster. But the problem is that the first question could be "Is the target word a natural disaster?" If yes, then the answer is among Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon, Tornado. If no, then the boats.
