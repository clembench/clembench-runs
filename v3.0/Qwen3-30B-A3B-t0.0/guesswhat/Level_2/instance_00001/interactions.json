The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The words are Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder, Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. Let's list them:\n\nMinnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder – these are all fish. Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb – these are parts of speech or related to language.\n\nSo maybe the first question could be: Is the word a type of fish? If yes, then it's one of the first four. If no, then it's one of the last four.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or spelling, but they can be about general characteristics. So asking if it's a fish is allowed because it's a general category.\n\nSo first question: Is the word a type of fish?\n\nIf yes, then narrow down to Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder. Then next question could be about size or habitat. But maybe another approach. Alternatively, if the answer is no, then the word is Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think. The target could be in either group. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst question: Is the word a type of",
