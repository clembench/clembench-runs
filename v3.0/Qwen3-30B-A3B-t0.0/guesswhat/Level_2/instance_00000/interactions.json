The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Cave', 'Cliff', 'Waterfall', 'Ocean', 'Kilometer', 'Centimeter', 'Furlong', 'Yard']",

The words are Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean, Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard. \n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or properties. \n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a natural landform?\" That would separate things like Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean from the units of measurement (Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard). Let me check: Cave is a natural formation, Cliff is a rock face, Waterfall is a natural feature, Ocean is a large body of water. The others are units. So if the answer is yes, then the target is one of the first four. If no, then it's one of the units. That's a good first question.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Let me think. Another approach: \"Is the word a unit of length?\" That would directly target the measurement terms. If yes, then the answer is among Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard. If no, then the other four. But maybe starting with the more common category? Not sure. Let's go with the first idea.\n\nSo first question: \"Is the",
