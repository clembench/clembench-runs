	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Asparagus', 'Celery', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Television', 'Radio', 'Noisemaker', 'Fan']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke, Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Let's list the words again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Vegetables: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke.\\ \tt Others: Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe the first question could be whether the word is a vegetable. If yes, then narrow down to those four. If no, then the other four. But wait, the user said questions can't be about structure or specific characteristics. Wait, but "vegetable" is a category, not about spelling or structure. So that's allowed.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first question: Is the target word a vegetable?\\ \tt \\ \tt If yes, then the possible words are Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke. Then next question could be about something else. If no, then the other four: Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\\ \tt \\ \tt But maybe there's a better way. Let's think. Another approach: think about whether the word is an electronic device. Television and Radio are electronic devices. Noisemaker and Fan are not. Wait, Fan could be an electronic device (like a fan), but maybe it's more of a general
