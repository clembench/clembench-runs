The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Asparagus', 'Celery', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Television', 'Radio', 'Noisemaker', 'Fan']",

The words are Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke, Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Let's list the words again:\n\nVegetables: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke.\nOthers: Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\n\nSo maybe the first question could be whether the word is a vegetable. If yes, then narrow down to those four. If no, then the other four. But wait, the user said questions can't be about structure or specific characteristics. Wait, but \"vegetable\" is a category, not about spelling or structure. So that's allowed.\n\nSo first question: Is the target word a vegetable?\n\nIf yes, then the possible words are Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke. Then next question could be about something else. If no, then the other four: Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think. Another approach: think about whether the word is an electronic device. Television and Radio are electronic devices. Noisemaker and Fan are not. Wait, Fan could be an electronic device (like a fan), but maybe it's more of a general",
