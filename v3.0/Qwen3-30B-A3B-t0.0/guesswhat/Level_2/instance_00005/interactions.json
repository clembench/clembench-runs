The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Spoon', 'Cup', 'Bowl', 'Ladle', 'Tequila', 'Brandy', 'Margarita', 'Martini']",

The words are Spoon, Cup, Bowl, Ladle, Tequila, Brandy, Margarita, Martini.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I have to think about meanings or uses.\n\nLooking at the words, some are kitchen utensils (Spoon, Cup, Bowl, Ladle) and others are drinks (Tequila, Brandy, Margarita, Martini). So maybe the first question could be: \"Is the target word a drink?\" If yes, then focus on the drinks. If no, then the utensils.\n\nBut wait, the user said only one question per turn. So first question: \"Is the target word a drink?\" Let's say the answer is yes. Then the possible words are Tequila, Brandy, Margarita, Martini. Then next question could be about type of drink. Like \"Is it a type of liquor?\" But Tequila and Brandy are liquors, while Margarita and Martini are cocktails. But maybe that's too specific. Alternatively, \"Is it a cocktail?\" If yes, then Margarita or Martini. If no, then Tequila or Brandy. Then next question could be \"Is it a type",
