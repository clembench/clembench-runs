	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Lettuce', 'Kale', 'Avocado', 'Grape', 'Bassoon', 'Oboe', 'Clarinet', 'Saxophone']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape, Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Let's list the words:\\ \tt \\ \tt Vegetables: Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape? Wait, Grape is a fruit. Avocado is a fruit but often considered a vegetable in cooking. Hmm. Maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, think about whether they are musical instruments or not. Let's check:\\ \tt \\ \tt Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone are all musical instruments. The others are foods. So maybe the first question could be: "Is the target word a musical instrument?" If yes, then it's one of the four instruments. If no, then it's one of the four foods.\\ \tt \\ \tt That's a good first question. Let's go with that.\\ \tt \\ \tt So QUESTION: Is the target word a musical instrument?\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then the remaining options are Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone. Then I need to narrow down further. Let's think about the next question. Maybe ask about the type of instrument. For example, "Is the target word a woodwind instrument?" But wait, all the remaining are woodw
