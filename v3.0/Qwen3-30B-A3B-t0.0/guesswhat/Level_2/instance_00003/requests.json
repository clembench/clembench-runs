I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape, Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Let's list the words:\n\nVegetables: Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape? Wait, Grape is a fruit. Avocado is a fruit but often considered a vegetable in cooking. Hmm. Maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, think about whether they are musical instruments or not. Let's check:\n\nBassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone are all musical instruments. The others are foods. So maybe the first question could be: \"Is the target word a musical instrument?\" If yes, then it's one of the four instruments. If no, then it's one of the four foods.\n\nThat's a good first question. Let's go with that.\n\nSo QUESTION: Is the target word a musical instrument?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the remaining options are Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone. Then I need to narrow down further. Let's think about the next question. Maybe ask about the type of instrument. For example, \"Is the target word a woodwind instrument?\" But wait, all the remaining are woodw",
