Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Propane, Kerosene, Petroleum, Coal, Major, Lieutenant, Corporal, Sergeant.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. Let's list them out. Propane, Kerosene, Petroleum, and Coal are all types of fuel or energy sources. Then there's Major, Lieutenant, Corporal, Sergeant which are military ranks. So maybe the first question could be whether the word is a type of fuel or a military rank. That would split the list into two groups. Let me check: Propane (fuel), Kerosene (fuel), Petroleum (fuel), Coal (fuel), and the others are ranks. So if the answer is yes, it's one of the four fuels. If no, it's one of the ranks.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about structure or spelling, just yes/no. So the question should be something like \"Is the word a type of fuel?\" or \"Is the word a military rank?\" But the user wants the question to be as brief as possible. Let me make sure that's allowed. The rules say the question can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking about categories like fuel or military rank is okay because it's a general characteristic.\n\nSo",
