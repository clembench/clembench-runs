I need to figure out the target word from the list ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe'] with as few questions as possible, max 7. The questions have to be yes/no, not about the word's structure or specific features. So, I can't ask things like \"Does it have four letters?\" or \"Is it a tree?\" Wait, wait, actually, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe \"Is it a tree?\" is allowed because it's about the category, not the word's structure. But I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, I should think about the categories. The list has trees and animals. Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine are trees. Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe are animals. So maybe the first question could be \"Is the target word a tree?\" That would split the list into two groups. If the answer is yes, then it's one of the four trees. If no, then one of the four animals. That's a good first question because it halves the possibilities.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be related to the structure or spelling. But \"tree\" is a category, not a structural feature. So that's allowed. So",
