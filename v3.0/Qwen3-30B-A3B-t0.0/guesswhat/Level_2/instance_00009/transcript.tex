	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe'] with as few questions as possible, max 7. The questions have to be yes/no, not about the word's structure or specific features. So, I can't ask things like "Does it have four letters?" or "Is it a tree?" Wait, wait, actually, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe "Is it a tree?" is allowed because it's about the category, not the word's structure. But I need to be careful.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about the categories. The list has trees and animals. Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine are trees. Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe are animals. So maybe the first question could be "Is the target word a tree?" That would split the list into two groups. If the answer is yes, then it's one of the four trees. If no, then one of the four animals. That's a good first question because it halves the possibilities.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user said the questions can't be related to the structure or spelling. But "tree" is a category, not a structural feature. So that's allowed. So
