Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology, gp, surgeon, dentist, physician. \n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words fit into. The list includes medical specialties and professions. Pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology are all branches of medicine. Then there are gp (general practitioner), surgeon, dentist, physician. So maybe I can start by asking if the word is a medical specialty or a medical profession.\n\nWait, but the questions can't relate to the structure or specific characteristics of the word. So I can't ask about the number of letters or if it's a profession. Hmm. So I need to think of other attributes. Maybe the role of the person. For example, \"Is the target word a type of doctor?\" But wait, \"gp\" is a doctor, surgeon, dentist, physician are all doctors. But pathology is a specialty, not a person. So maybe that's a way to split the list.\n\nSo first question: Is the target word a type of medical specialty? If yes, then the options are pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology. If no, then it's gp, surgeon, dentist, physician. But wait, surgeon, dentist, physician are professions, not specialties. So maybe that's a good first split.\n\n",
