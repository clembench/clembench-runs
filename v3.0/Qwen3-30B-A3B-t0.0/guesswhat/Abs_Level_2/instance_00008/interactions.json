The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The words are: nanometre, centimetre, mile, fathom, hairdresser, plumber, author, presenter.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. The first four are units of measurement: nanometre, centimetre, mile, fathom. The others are professions or roles: hairdresser, plumber, author, presenter. So maybe my first question could be whether the word is a unit of measurement or a profession. That would split the list into two groups. Let me check: if the answer is yes, then it's one of the first four; if no, then the last four. That seems like a good starting point. So the first question would be: \"Is the target word a unit of measurement?\" \n\nIf the answer is yes, then I have four options left. Then I need to narrow down further. Let's say the answer is yes. Next, maybe ask if it's a length unit. Wait, but all the remaining are units of length? Nanometre, centimetre, mile, fathom. Yes, they are all units of length. So maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe ask about the scale. For example, \"Is the target word a very small unit?\" But nanometre is very small,",
