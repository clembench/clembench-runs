The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['hurdle', 'fencing', 'surfing', 'swimming', 'hostile', 'friendly', 'leader', 'extrovert']",

The words are hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming, hostile, friendly, leader, extrovert.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Let's list the words and see if there are obvious categories. \n\nLooking at the words: hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming – these all seem like activities or sports. Then hostile, friendly are adjectives. Leader and extrovert are nouns, but leader is a role, extrovert is a personality trait. \n\nSo maybe first question: Is the word an activity or sport? Let's check. Hurdle could be a sport (like track and field), fencing, surfing, swimming are definitely sports. Hostile and friendly are adjectives. Leader and extrovert are nouns but not activities. So if the answer is yes, then possible words are hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming. If no, then the target is among hostile, friendly, leader, extrovert.\n\nBut the user said questions can't be about structure or specific characteristics. Wait, the second rule says questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe I can't ask about being a sport. Wait, but is \"activity\" considered a specific characteristic? Hmm. Maybe the question is allowed because it's a general category",
