The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary, building, monument, illustration, drawing.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. The user said questions can't be about spelling or structure, just yes/no. So maybe start with broad categories. For example, are you thinking of a crime? Let's check the list. Shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary are all crimes. The others like building, monument, illustration, drawing are not. So if I ask \"Is the target word a type of crime?\" then if yes, narrow down to the first four. If no, then the other four.\n\nBut wait, the user said only one question per turn. So first question: \"Is the target word a type of crime?\" Let's say the answer is yes. Then the possible words are shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary. Then next question: Is it a specific type of theft? Or maybe ask about the number of syllables? Wait, no, can't ask about structure. So maybe next question: \"Is the target word a violent crime?\" But robbery and burglary might be considered violent, while shoplifting and stealing are not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ask about the action: \"Is the target word related to taking something without permission?\"",
