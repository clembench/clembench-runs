	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['shoplifting', 'robbery', 'stealing', 'burglary', 'building', 'monument', 'illustration', 'drawing']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary, building, monument, illustration, drawing.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories these words might fit into. The user said questions can't be about spelling or structure, just yes/no. So maybe start with broad categories. For example, are you thinking of a crime? Let's check the list. Shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary are all crimes. The others like building, monument, illustration, drawing are not. So if I ask "Is the target word a type of crime?" then if yes, narrow down to the first four. If no, then the other four.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user said only one question per turn. So first question: "Is the target word a type of crime?" Let's say the answer is yes. Then the possible words are shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary. Then next question: Is it a specific type of theft? Or maybe ask about the number of syllables? Wait, no, can't ask about structure. So maybe next question: "Is the target word a violent crime?" But robbery and burglary might be considered violent, while shoplifting and stealing are not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ask about the action: "Is the target word related to taking something without permission?"
