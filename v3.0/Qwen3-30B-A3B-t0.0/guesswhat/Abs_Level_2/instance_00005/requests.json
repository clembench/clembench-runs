I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are 'sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word', 'verb', 'adverb'. \n\nFirst, I should think about the possible categories these words might fit into. The first four are ordinal numbers (sixth, fourth, third, tenth), and the others are parts of speech or general terms. So maybe a good first question is whether the word is an ordinal number. That would split the list into two groups: the ordinals and the rest.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the target is one of the four ordinals. Then I can ask about the number. For example, \"Is the number less than fifth?\" If yes, then third. If no, maybe sixth or tenth. Wait, but fourth is also there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask about the number's value. But since the user said not to ask about specific characteristics of the word itself, like spelling or structure. So maybe I can't ask about the number's value directly. Wait, but the question has to be about the word's meaning, not its structure. So maybe \"Is the word a number?\" but that's too vague. Wait, the first question was about being an ordinal, which is a category. So if the answer is yes, then the next",
