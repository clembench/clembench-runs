The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word', 'verb', 'adverb']",

The words are 'sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word', 'verb', 'adverb'. \n\nFirst, I should think about the possible categories these words might fit into. The first four are ordinal numbers (sixth, fourth, third, tenth), and the others are parts of speech or general terms. So maybe a good first question is whether the word is an ordinal number. That would split the list into two groups: the ordinals and the rest.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the target is one of the four ordinals. Then I can ask about the number. For example, \"Is the number less than fifth?\" If yes, then third. If no, maybe sixth or tenth. Wait, but fourth is also there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask about the number's value. But since the user said not to ask about specific characteristics of the word itself, like spelling or structure. So maybe I can't ask about the number's value directly. Wait, but the question has to be about the word's meaning, not its structure. So maybe \"Is the word a number?\" but that's too vague. Wait, the first question was about being an ordinal, which is a category. So if the answer is yes, then the next",
