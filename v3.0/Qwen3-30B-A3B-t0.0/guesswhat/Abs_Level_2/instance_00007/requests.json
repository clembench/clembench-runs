Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: grandson, granddaughter, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, trapezium, parallelogram, decahedron, dodecahedron.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. The first four are family relations, and the last four are geometric shapes. So maybe the first question should be whether the word is a family relation or a geometric shape. That would split the list into two groups. Let me check: yes, that's a valid yes/no question. If the answer is yes, then it's one of the first four; if no, then the last four. That's a good starting point.\n\nSo the first question would be: \"Is the target word a family relation?\" If yes, then focus on grandson, granddaughter, mother-in-law, sister-in-law. If no, then trapezium, parallelogram, decahedron, dodecahedron.\n\nNext, depending on the answer, I can narrow down. Let's say the answer is yes. Then I need to differentiate between family relations. Maybe next question: \"Is the target word a child of one's child?\" That would be grandson or granddaughter. If yes, then the next question could be about gender, but the rules say no specific characteristics. Wait,",
