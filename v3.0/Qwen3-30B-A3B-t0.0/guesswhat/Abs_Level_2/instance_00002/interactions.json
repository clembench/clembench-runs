The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['french', 'spanish', 'technology', 'engineering', 'twenty-three', 'eleven', 'one', 'seven']",

The words are: french, spanish, technology, engineering, twenty-three, eleven, one, seven.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or categories. Let's list possible attributes.\n\nPossible questions: Is the word a language? Well, 'french' and 'spanish' are languages. Others like 'technology' or 'engineering' are fields. 'Twenty-three' is a number, 'eleven', 'one', 'seven' are numbers. So maybe start with \"Is the word a language?\" If yes, then between french and spanish. If no, then the rest.\n\nBut maybe another approach. Let's see the numbers: twenty-three, eleven, one, seven. Then the others are non-numerical. So maybe first question: Is the word a number? If yes, then among twenty-three, eleven, one, seven. If no, then the others. But the problem is that 'twenty-three' is a number, but maybe the question could be \"Is the word a number?\" But the user said the questions can't be about structure, but numbers are semantic. So that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if it's a single-word (like '",
