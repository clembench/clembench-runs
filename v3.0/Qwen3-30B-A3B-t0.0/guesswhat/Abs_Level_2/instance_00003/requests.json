Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: lunchtime, supper time, breakfast, teatime, anorexia, bulimia, sociopath, psychopath.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. Let's list them:\n\n- Meal times: lunchtime, supper time, breakfast, teatime.\n- Eating disorders: anorexia, bulimia.\n- Personality disorders: sociopath, psychopath.\n\nSo maybe the first question could be whether the word is related to meal times. If yes, then narrow down to those four. If no, then check if it's an eating disorder or a personality disorder.\n\nBut the user said the questions can't be about the structure or specific characteristics of the word. Wait, but the question about meal times isn't about the word's structure, it's about the meaning. So that's allowed.\n\nSo first question: Is the word related to a meal time? Let's check the list. The first four are meal times. The others are not. So if the answer is yes, then the target is one of those four. If no, then it's one of the other four.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. But \"meal time\" is a semantic category, so that's",
