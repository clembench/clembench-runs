The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Chrysanthemum', 'Dandelion', 'Sturgeon', 'Trout', 'Seeds', 'Edger', 'Rosemary', 'Chives']",

The words are Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Sturgeon, Trout, Seeds, Edger, Rosemary, Chives.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about general characteristics. Let's list the words again:\n\nChrysanthemum (a flower)\nDandelion (a flower)\nSturgeon (a fish)\nTrout (a fish)\nSeeds (plant parts)\nEdger (maybe a tool or a person?)\nRosemary (herb)\nChives (herb)\n\nSo maybe start by asking if the word is a plant. But wait, some are plants (Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Rosemary, Chives), some are fish (Sturgeon, Trout), Seeds (plant part), Edger (not sure). But \"Seeds\" is a noun, but maybe not a plant. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a type of fish. Let's see: Sturgeon and Trout are fish. But then the other words are not. But if I ask \"Is the target word a type of fish?\" then yes for Sturgeon and Trout. But that would split the list into 2 fish and 6 others. Then",
