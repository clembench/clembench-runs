The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list ['Private', 'Cadet', 'Mesa', 'Rock', 'Legos', 'Train', 'Dinero', 'Dime'] with as few questions as possible, max 7. The questions have to be yes/no, and not about the word's structure or specific features. So, I can't ask things like \"Does it have 5 letters?\" or \"Does it start with a vowel?\".\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or attributes that the words might fit into. Let's list the words again: Private, Cadet, Mesa, Rock, Legos, Train, Dinero, Dime. \n\nHmm. Maybe think about common themes. For example, some of these could be types of things. Like \"Train\" is a vehicle, \"Rock\" is a mineral, \"Legos\" are toys. But how to frame that into a yes/no question?\n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. Are they all nouns? Yes, they are. So that's not helpful. Maybe think about whether they can be verbs? \"Train\" can be a verb, \"Rock\" can be a verb, \"Dime\" is a noun (a coin), but maybe not a verb. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nAnother angle: maybe think about common associations. For example, \"Dime\" and \"Dinero\" are related to",
