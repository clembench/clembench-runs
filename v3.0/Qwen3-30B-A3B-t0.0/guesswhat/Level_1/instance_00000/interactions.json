The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center']",

The words are White, Silver, Hutch, Chair, Sweatshirt, Shoes, Punter, Center.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or attributes that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific characteristics, I need to think of general properties. Maybe things like parts of speech, commonality, or associations.\n\nLet me list the words again: White (adjective/noun), Silver (noun/adjective), Hutch (noun), Chair (noun), Sweatshirt (noun), Shoes (noun), Punter (noun), Center (noun). Wait, some are nouns, some can be adjectives. But the question can't relate to structure, so maybe parts of speech isn't allowed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about common objects vs. less common. But that's vague. Maybe think of categories like clothing, furniture, sports terms, etc. For example, Shoes, Sweatshirt, Chair, Hutch, maybe others. But how to frame a yes/no question about that?\n\nAnother approach: think of the words that are parts of a sports team or position. Punter and Center are football positions. Hutch? Not sure. Maybe that's a stretch. But if I ask if it's a sports position, but I need to phrase it as a yes/no question. But the problem is",
