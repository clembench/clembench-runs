	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Mosquito', 'Bee', 'Disco', 'Blues', 'Fog', 'Hurricane', 'Cannabis', 'Pepper']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Mosquito, Bee, Disco, Blues, Fog, Hurricane, Cannabis, Pepper.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about general characteristics. Let's list possible questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe start with something like "Is the word a type of music?" But wait, Disco and Blues are music genres. So if the answer is yes, then the target is either Disco or Blues. If no, then it's one of the others. That could be a good first question.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "Is the word a natural phenomenon?" Fog, Hurricane, maybe Mosquito? Not sure. But Hurricane and Fog are natural, but Mosquito is an animal. Maybe that's not as effective.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "Is the word a living organism?" Mosquito, Bee, Cannabis, Pepper. Those are living. The others are not. So if I ask that, and get yes, then it's one of those four. If no, then it's the other four. That might split the list evenly. But maybe that's a good first question.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user said to make the question brief. Let me check the examples. The user's example questions might be like "Is it a type of music?" or
