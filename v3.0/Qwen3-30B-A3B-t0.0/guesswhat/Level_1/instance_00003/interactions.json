The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage']",

The words are: Semi, Sled, Mailman, Scientist, Clover, Broccoli, Foyer, Garage.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general attributes. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a person?\" But wait, some words are nouns. Let's check: Semi (could be a car or a prefix), Sled (object), Mailman (person), Scientist (person), Clover (plant), Broccoli (vegetable), Foyer (place), Garage (place). So if I ask \"Is the word a person?\" then Mailman and Scientist would be yes. But maybe that's a good first split. But maybe there's a better question.\n\nAlternatively, think about length. Let's see the lengths: Semi (4), Sled (4), Mailman (7), Scientist (9), Clover (6), Broccoli (8), Foyer (5), Garage (6). Maybe ask if the word has more than 5 letters. Let's see: Mailman (7), Scientist (9), Broccoli (8) would be yes. Others no. That splits into two groups. But maybe that's a good first question",
