Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Cinnamon, Basil, Dog, Child, Latin, Classical, Coke, Lemonade.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a type of drink?\" That could separate drinks from others. Looking at the list: Coke and Lemonade are drinks. So if the answer is yes, then it's either Coke or Lemonade. If no, then it's one of the others. That's a good first question.\n\nBut wait, what about other possibilities? Like \"Is the word a noun?\" Well, all are nouns. So that's not helpful. How about \"Is the word a type of plant?\" Cinnamon and Basil are plants. Dog, Child, Latin, Classical, Coke, Lemonade are not. So that's another possible question. But maybe the drink question is better because it splits into two groups of 2 and 6. The plant question splits into 2 and 6 as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"Is the word a common noun?\" All are common nouns, so that's not helpful. Maybe \"Is the word related to a language?\" Latin is a language.",
