The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Cinnamon', 'Basil', 'Dog', 'Child', 'Latin', 'Classical', 'Coke', 'Lemonade']",

The words are Cinnamon, Basil, Dog, Child, Latin, Classical, Coke, Lemonade.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a type of drink?\" That could separate drinks from others. Looking at the list: Coke and Lemonade are drinks. So if the answer is yes, then it's either Coke or Lemonade. If no, then it's one of the others. That's a good first question.\n\nBut wait, what about other possibilities? Like \"Is the word a noun?\" Well, all are nouns. So that's not helpful. How about \"Is the word a type of plant?\" Cinnamon and Basil are plants. Dog, Child, Latin, Classical, Coke, Lemonade are not. So that's another possible question. But maybe the drink question is better because it splits into two groups of 2 and 6. The plant question splits into 2 and 6 as well. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"Is the word a common noun?\" All are common nouns, so that's not helpful. Maybe \"Is the word related to a language?\" Latin is a language.",
