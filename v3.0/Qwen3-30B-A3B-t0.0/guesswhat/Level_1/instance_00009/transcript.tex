	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Running', 'Track', 'Cornerback', 'Coach', 'Scarf', 'Gloves', 'Heirlooms', 'Clothes']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach, Scarf, Gloves, Heirlooms, Clothes.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories these words might fit into. Let's list possible attributes. Maybe things like sports-related, clothing items, parts of a team, etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt The first question should split the list into two roughly equal groups. Let's see. For example, asking if the word is a type of clothing. Let's check the list: Scarf, Gloves, Clothes, maybe Heirlooms? Not sure. Heirlooms are more like family items. So maybe "Is the word a type of clothing?" Then the answer would be yes for Scarf, Gloves, Clothes. But that's three words. The others would be Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach, Heirlooms. But maybe that's not the best split. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's related to sports. Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach. That's four words. Then the rest are non-sports. But I need to make sure the question is a yes/no and not about structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another approach: think of the most common categories. Let's try "Is the word a type of clothing?" If yes, then Scarf, Gloves, Clothes. If no, then the
