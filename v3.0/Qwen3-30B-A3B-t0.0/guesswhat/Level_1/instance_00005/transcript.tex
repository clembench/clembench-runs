	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Topaz', 'Sapphire', 'Blouse', 'Glasses', 'Tuba', 'Alarm', 'Burglary', 'Rape']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Topaz, Sapphire, Blouse, Glasses, Tuba, Alarm, Burglary, Rape.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list the words again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Topaz (a gemstone), Sapphire (another gemstone), Blouse (clothing), Glasses (eyewear or a verb), Tuba (musical instrument), Alarm (a warning device), Burglary (a crime), Rape (a crime).\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe start with whether the word is a noun. Wait, all are nouns. So that's not helpful. What about categories like objects vs. actions? But some words can be both. Like "Glasses" can be a noun or a verb. But maybe that's too specific.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the type of word. For example, are they all things, or some are actions? But again, not sure. Let's think of possible questions.\\ \tt \\ \tt First question: Is the word a type of jewelry? Let's check. Topaz and Sapphire are gemstones, so maybe jewelry. Blouse is clothing, Glasses could be jewelry (eyeglasses), Tuba is an instrument, Alarm is a device, Burglary
