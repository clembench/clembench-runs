I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Topaz, Sapphire, Blouse, Glasses, Tuba, Alarm, Burglary, Rape.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list the words again:\n\nTopaz (a gemstone), Sapphire (another gemstone), Blouse (clothing), Glasses (eyewear or a verb), Tuba (musical instrument), Alarm (a warning device), Burglary (a crime), Rape (a crime).\n\nHmm, maybe start with whether the word is a noun. Wait, all are nouns. So that's not helpful. What about categories like objects vs. actions? But some words can be both. Like \"Glasses\" can be a noun or a verb. But maybe that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think about the type of word. For example, are they all things, or some are actions? But again, not sure. Let's think of possible questions.\n\nFirst question: Is the word a type of jewelry? Let's check. Topaz and Sapphire are gemstones, so maybe jewelry. Blouse is clothing, Glasses could be jewelry (eyeglasses), Tuba is an instrument, Alarm is a device, Burglary",
