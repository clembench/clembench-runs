	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['midday', 'sunrise', 'suppertime', 'lunchtime', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'breakfast', 'brunch']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are midday, sunrise, supper time, lunch time, afternoon, evening, breakfast, brunch.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I have to think about meanings or contexts. \\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe start with time of day. For example, "Is the word related to morning?" But wait, some words like breakfast and brunch are morning, but sunrise is also morning. However, "sunrise" is a specific event, not a time period. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask about whether it's a specific time or a general period. But I need to make sure the question is answerable with yes/no.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another approach: think about whether the word refers to a specific meal or a general time. For example, "Is the word a specific meal time?" But "midday" and "afternoon" are general times, while "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner" are meals. But the list includes "suppertime" and "lunchtime", which are specific meal times. So maybe a question like "Is the word a specific meal time?" That would split the list into those that are meal times (breakfast, lunchtime, supper time, brunch) and others (midday,
