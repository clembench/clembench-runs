	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['ton', 'pound', 'microgram', 'milligram', 'millilitre', 'litre', 'tablespoon', 'teaspoon']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: ton, pound, microgram, milligram, millilitre, litre, tablespoon, teaspoon.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about the categories these words might fit into. They all are units of measurement, but maybe there's a way to split them. Let's list them:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Weight units: ton, pound, microgram, milligram\\ \tt - Volume units: millilitre, litre, tablespoon, teaspoon\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe the first question could be whether the word is a weight unit or a volume unit. That would split the list into two groups. Let me check:\\ \tt \\ \tt If I ask "Is the target word a unit of weight?" Then if yes, the possible words are ton, pound, microgram, milligram. If no, then it's millilitre, litre, tablespoon, teaspoon. That's a good first split.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, are all of these definitely weight or volume? Let me confirm. Ton and pound are definitely weight. Microgram and milligram are also weight. Millilitre and litre are volume. Tablespoon and teaspoon can be volume (like in cooking) but sometimes they're considered measures. So maybe that's a valid split.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first question: "Is the target word a unit of weight?" Let's go with that. Then depending on the answer,
