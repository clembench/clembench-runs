	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['hinduism', 'scientology', 'taoism', 'jainism', 'christianity', 'sikhism', 'protestant', 'quaker']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: hinduism, scientology, taoism, jainism, christianity, sikhism, protestant, quaker.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about the characteristics that can differentiate these words. Since I can't ask about spelling or structure, I need to think about their meanings or categories. Let's list them:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Hinduism: a religion originating in India, polytheistic.\\ \tt - Scientology: a modern religion founded by L. Ron Hubbard.\\ \tt - Taoism: a Chinese philosophy/religion emphasizing harmony with the Tao.\\ \tt - Jainism: an ancient Indian religion emphasizing non-violence.\\ \tt - Christianity: a monotheistic religion based on Jesus Christ.\\ \tt - Sikhism: a monotheistic religion from the Indian subcontinent.\\ \tt - Protestant: a branch of Christianity, so it's a denomination, not a religion itself.\\ \tt - Quaker: short for Religious Society of Friends, a Christian denomination.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but some of these are religions, others are denominations. For example, Protestant and Quaker are Christian denominations. So maybe the first question could be about whether the target is a major world religion or a denomination. But how to phrase that as a yes/no question?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the number of letters? But the rules say not to ask about structure or spelling. So
