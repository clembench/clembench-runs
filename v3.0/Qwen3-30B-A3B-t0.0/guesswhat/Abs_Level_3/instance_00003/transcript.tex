	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['oblong', 'semicircle', 'nonagon', 'heptagon', 'trapezium', 'parallelogram', 'dodecahedron', 'decahedron']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: oblong, semicircle, nonagon, heptagon, trapezium, parallelogram, dodecahedron, decahedron.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or properties.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me list the words and see if I can find some common attributes. \\ \tt \\ \tt Oblong: a shape, like a rectangle that's longer than it is wide. It's a 2D shape.\\ \tt \\ \tt Semicircle: half of a circle, also 2D.\\ \tt \\ \tt Nonagon: a 9-sided polygon. 2D.\\ \tt \\ \tt Heptagon: 7-sided polygon. 2D.\\ \tt \\ \tt Trapezium: a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. 2D.\\ \tt \\ \tt Parallelogram: a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. 2D.\\ \tt \\ \tt Dodecahedron: a 3D shape with 12 faces. \\ \tt \\ \tt Decahedron: a 3D shape with 10 faces.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first thing I notice is that dodecahedron and decahedron are 3D shapes, while the rest are 2D. That's a big split
