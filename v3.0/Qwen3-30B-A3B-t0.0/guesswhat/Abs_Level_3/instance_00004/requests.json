Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are baker, butcher, accountant, businessman, musician, dancer, hairdresser, plumber.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I have to focus on meanings or professions. Let me list the words again:\n\n- baker\n- butcher\n- accountant\n- businessman\n- musician\n- dancer\n- hairdresser\n- plumber\n\nHmm. Maybe start with a broad question. Like, \"Is the target word a profession that typically requires formal education?\" But wait, some of these might not. For example, baker or butcher might not need formal education, while accountant or lawyer would. But the list doesn't have lawyer. Wait, the words here: accountant, businessman, maybe musician? Not sure. But this might be too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the type of work. For example, \"Does the job involve creating or making something?\" But that's too broad. Maybe \"Is the target word a service provider?\" But all of them are service providers. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: think about the number of syllables. But the rules say not to ask about structure. So that's out.\n\nWhat about the type of work? For example, \"Is the target word a person who works with their",
