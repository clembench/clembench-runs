Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are all military ranks: gunner, officer, corporal, sergeant, captain, major, general, brigadier.\n\nFirst, I should think about the hierarchy of military ranks. From lowest to highest: gunner (maybe?), corporal, sergeant, officer (but officer is a broader term), then captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, brigadier, general. Wait, but the list here includes 'officer' as a separate entry. Hmm, maybe 'officer' is a higher rank than some others? Or maybe 'officer' is a category that includes others. But the list has 'officer' as a specific rank. Wait, in the US military, for example, the ranks go: Private, Private First Class, Specialist, Corporal, Sergeant, Staff Sergeant, Sergeant First Class, Master Sergeant, etc., then Officer ranks start with Second Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Brigadier General, Major General, etc. So 'officer' is a category, but in the list, 'officer' is one of the options. So maybe the target is one of these ranks. \n\nSo the list includes 'gunner' which is a rank in some branches, like the Royal Navy, but maybe not in the US. But the",
