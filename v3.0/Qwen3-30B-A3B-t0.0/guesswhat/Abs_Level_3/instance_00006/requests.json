Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: technician, optician, psychotherapist, chiropractor, surgeon, gp, nurse, pharmacist.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to the word's structure or specific characteristics, I need to think about their roles or professions. \n\nMaybe start with the most general question. Like, \"Is the target word a type of doctor?\" But wait, some of these aren't doctors. For example, nurse, pharmacist, technician might not be doctors. But surgeon, gp (general practitioner), maybe chiropractor? Not sure. Maybe that's a good first question. Let's check:\n\nIf I ask \"Is the target word a type of doctor?\" Then the answers would be:\n\n- Surgeon: yes\n- GP: yes\n- Psychotherapist: maybe, but sometimes they are considered doctors (PhD) but not medical doctors. Hmm, tricky. Maybe not the best question.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of letters. But the rules say not to ask about structure or spelling. So that's out.\n\nAnother approach: think about the role. For example, \"Does the target word refer to a healthcare professional?\" But all of them are healthcare professionals. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe \"Is the target word",
