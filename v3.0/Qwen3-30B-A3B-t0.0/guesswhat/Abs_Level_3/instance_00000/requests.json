Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are troll, minotaur, psychic, witch, monster, unicorn, vampire, goblin.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general characteristics. Maybe start with something like \"Is the word a type of creature?\" But wait, all of them are creatures except maybe 'psychic' and 'witch'? Wait, 'witch' is a person, but also a creature in some contexts. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, think about whether they are mythical beings. Let's check:\n\nTroll, minotaur, unicorn, vampire, goblin are all mythical creatures. Witch could be considered a mythical being, but 'psychic' and 'monster' are more general. 'Monster' is a bit broad. So maybe a question like \"Is the word a mythical creature?\" But then 'monster' might be a yes, but 'psychic' is no. But I need to make sure the question is answerable with yes/no. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word is a type of supernatural being. But again, 'monster' is a bit vague. Maybe another approach. Let's think of the most common categories. For example, \"Does the word refer",
