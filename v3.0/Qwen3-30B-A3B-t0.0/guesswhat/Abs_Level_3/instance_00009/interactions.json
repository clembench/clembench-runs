The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The words are cholera, herpes, smallpox, chickenpox, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, depression, anxiety.\n\nFirst, I should think about the categories these words might fit into. Let's list them out:\n\n- Cholera: a bacterial infection, waterborne.\n- Herpes: a viral infection, can be genital or oral.\n- Smallpox: a viral disease, now eradicated.\n- Chickenpox: another viral infection, usually in children.\n- Chlamydia: a bacterial STI.\n- Gonorrhoea: another bacterial STI.\n- Depression: a mental health disorder.\n- Anxiety: another mental health disorder.\n\nSo, maybe the first question could be about whether the word is a disease or a mental health condition. Let's check:\n\nIf I ask, \"Is the target word a mental health disorder?\" Then the answer would be yes for depression and anxiety, no for the rest. That splits the list into two groups. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask about whether it's a viral infection. Let's see: herpes, smallpox, chickenpox are viral. Cholera, chlamydia, gonorrhoea are bacterial. Depression and anxiety are not diseases. So if I ask \"Is",
