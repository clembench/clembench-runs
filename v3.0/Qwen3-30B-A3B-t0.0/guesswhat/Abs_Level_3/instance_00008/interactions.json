The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['sledding', 'cycling', 'football', 'boxing', 'swimming', 'surfing', 'canoeing', 'kayaking']",

The words are sledding, cycling, football, boxing, swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking. \n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nMaybe start with whether the activity is typically done in water. Let's check: sledding is on snow, cycling is on land, football is on a field, boxing is in a ring, swimming is in water, surfing is in water, canoeing and kayaking are also in water. So if I ask if the word is related to water, then the answers would be yes for swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking. That splits the list into two groups. But maybe that's a good first question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe check if it's a team sport. Football is a team sport, others like boxing, cycling, etc. But not sure. Let me think. Football is a team sport, others might not be. But maybe that's not the best first question.\n\nAnother angle: is the activity contact sports? Boxing is contact, football might be, but others like cycling aren't. But maybe that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of letters. But the rules say not to ask about",
