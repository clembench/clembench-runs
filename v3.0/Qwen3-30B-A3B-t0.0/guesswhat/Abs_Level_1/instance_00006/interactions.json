The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['birthday', 'marriage', 'laud', 'afternoon', 'optometrist', 'podiatry', 'spot', 'sweating']",

The words are: birthday, marriage, laud, afternoon, optometrist, podiatry, spot, sweating.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or common attributes that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nLet me list the words again:\n\n1. birthday\n2. marriage\n3. laud\n4. afternoon\n5. optometrist\n6. podiatry\n7. spot\n8. sweating\n\nHmm. Maybe start with something like \"Is the word related to a celebration?\" Birthday is a celebration, marriage could be, but maybe not. Laud is a verb meaning to praise, not sure. Afternoon is a time of day. Optometrist and podiatry are professions. Spot could be a place or a mark. Sweating is an action.\n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. But the rules say no structure, so maybe not. Wait, the rules say questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about parts of speech, length, letters, etc.\n\nSo, think about meanings. Let's try to find a question that splits the list into two roughly equal parts. For example, \"Is the word a",
