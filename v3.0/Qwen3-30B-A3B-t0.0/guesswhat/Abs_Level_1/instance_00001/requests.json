Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: polygon, crescent, lawyer, magistrate, bowl, tube, relay, soccer.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word related to a shape?\" But wait, \"polygon\" is a shape, \"crescent\" is a shape, \"bowl\" could be a shape, \"tube\" is a shape? Maybe. But \"lawyer\", \"magistrate\", \"relay\", \"soccer\" are not. So that might split into two groups. But I need to check if that's a valid question. The problem says the question can't be about structure or spelling, but \"related to a shape\" is a general concept. Maybe that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word is a person, place, or thing. But \"lawyer\" and \"magistrate\" are people, \"soccer\" is a sport, \"bowl\" is an object, etc. But maybe that's too vague.\n\nAnother approach: think of common attributes. For example, \"Is the word a type of sport?\" Soccer is a sport. But others? Maybe not. So",
