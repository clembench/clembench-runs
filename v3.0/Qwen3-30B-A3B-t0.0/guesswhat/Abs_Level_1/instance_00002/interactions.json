The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The words are: son, stepbrother, fever, sty, windsurfing, paragliding, optician, neurosurgeon.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or attributes that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nLet me list the words again: son (a male child), stepbrother (a brother from a step-parent), fever (a medical condition), sty (a place where pigs are kept), windsurfing (a sport), paragliding (another sport), optician (a professional who sells glasses), neurosurgeon (a doctor who operates on the nervous system).\n\nPossible questions: Maybe start with \"Is the word a person?\" That would separate words like son, stepbrother, optician, neurosurgeon from others. But then I need to check if that's allowed. The question is about the word's meaning, not structure, so that's okay.\n\nBut maybe a better first question. Let's think: Are there any words that are activities? Windsurfing and paragliding are activities. Fever is a condition, sty is a place, others are people or things.
