Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: outlier, datum, psychotic, greed, league, knot, one, twenty-nine.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general properties. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a number?\" But looking at the list, \"one\" and \"twenty-nine\" are numbers. \"Knot\" could be a unit, but not sure. \"Datum\" is a singular of data, not a number. \"Outlier\" is a statistical term. \"Psychotic\" is an adjective. \"Greed\" is a noun. \"League\" is a group. So maybe \"Is the word a number?\" would eliminate some. But \"knot\" is a unit of speed, but maybe not considered a number. So if I ask that, and the answer is yes, then it's either \"one\" or \"twenty-nine\". If no, then the rest. But maybe that's a good first question.\n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. But the user said no to structure or spelling. Wait, the rules say questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe parts of speech are allowed? Like \"Is the",
