The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['trespassing', 'urination', 'infanticide', 'cannibalism', 'intrigued', 'smiling', 'twenty-seven', 'nine']",

The words are: trespassing, urination, infanticide, cannibalism, intrigued, smiling, twenty-seven, nine.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word related to a crime?\" Let's check the words. Trespassing is a crime. Urination? Not really a crime unless in a specific context. Infanticide is a crime. Cannibalism is a crime. Intrigued is an emotion. Smiling is an action. Twenty-seven is a number. Nine is a number. So if I ask if it's a crime, the possible answers would be yes for trespassing, infanticide, cannibalism. That narrows it down to 3. But maybe that's a good first step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask about being a noun vs. verb. But the problem is some words can be both. For example, \"smiling\" is a noun (the act of smiling) or a verb. But maybe that's too vague.\n\nAnother angle: is the word a number? Twenty-seven and nine are numbers.
