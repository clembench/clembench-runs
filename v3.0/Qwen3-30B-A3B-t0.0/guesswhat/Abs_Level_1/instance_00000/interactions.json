The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['postman', 'actor', 'flatmate', 'bos', 'dietician', 'nurse', 'name', 'infinitive']",

The words are: postman, actor, flatmate, bos, dietician, nurse, name, infinitive.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think of general attributes. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word a profession?\" Let's check the list. Actor, nurse, dietician, postman, maybe bos? Not sure. Wait, \"bos\" might be an abbreviation, like Boss? Not sure. Flatmate is a person, but not a profession. Name is a noun. Infinitive is a grammar term. So maybe \"Is the word a profession?\" would get yes for actor, nurse, dietician, postman. But bos might not be. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"Is the word a person's job?\" That's similar.\n\nAlternatively, think about length. But the user said not to ask about structure or spelling. So length is part of structure? Maybe not. Wait, the rules say questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe length is allowed? Not sure. But maybe better to avoid that.\n\nAnother approach: think of categories like \"Is the word a single word?\"",
