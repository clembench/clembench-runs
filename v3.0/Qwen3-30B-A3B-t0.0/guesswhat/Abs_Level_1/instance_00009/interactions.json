The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['enemy', 'fiance', 'pleasure', 'cheering', 'reference', 'reality', 'percent', 'seventh']",

The words are: enemy, fiance, pleasure, cheering, reference, reality, percent, seventh.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or attributes that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific characteristics, I need to think of general properties. Let's list possible questions.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word related to a person?\" But some words like 'enemy' and 'fiance' are people, others like 'pleasure' or 'cheering' are not. But 'reference' could be a person (like a reference person) but maybe not. Hmm, not sure if that's a good first question.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of letters. Let's check the lengths:\n\nenemy (5), fiance (6), pleasure (8), cheering (8), reference (9), reality (7), percent (7), seventh (7). So lengths vary. Maybe ask if the word has more than 7 letters. Let's see: reference (9), pleasure (8), cheering (8). So if yes, then possible words are those three. If no, then the rest. But maybe that's a good first question. Let me check:\n\nIf I ask \"Does the word have more than 7 letters?\" Then:\n\nYes: pleasure, cheering,",
