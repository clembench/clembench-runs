The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['schizophrenia', 'sociopath', 'acquaintance', 'employee', 'parsec', 'pitch', 'lying', 'annoying']",

The words are: schizophrenia, sociopath, acquaintance, employee, parsec, pitch, lying, annoying.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or attributes that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nLet me list the words again: schizophrenia (a mental disorder), sociopath (a person with antisocial personality), acquaintance (someone you know but not well), employee (a worker), parsec (a unit of distance in astronomy), pitch (a sound frequency or a place to play sports), lying (the act of not telling the truth), annoying (an adjective describing something irritating).\n\nMaybe start with a broad question. Like, \"Is the word related to a mental health condition?\" That would target schizophrenia and sociopath. But wait, sociopath is more of a personality disorder, so maybe that's a yes. Let me check. If I ask that, and the answer is yes, then the target is either schizophrenia or sociopath. If no, then it's one of the others. But I need to make sure the question is phrased correctly. But the problem is, the user might not know the exact terms. But according to the rules, the answer is just yes or no. So maybe that's a possible first",
