Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: lunchtime, evening, fainting, swelling, paganism, wiccan, knight, sir.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about meanings or contexts.\n\nMaybe start with something like \"Is the word related to time?\" Let's check the list. Lunchtime and evening are time-related. The others? Fainting, swelling, paganism, wiccan, knight, sir. So if the answer is yes, then it's either lunchtime or evening. If no, then the target is in the other group. But that might not be the best first question because it splits into 2 and 6. Maybe a better split?\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word is a person or a concept. For example, \"Is the word a person's title?\" Sir and knight are titles. Wiccan and paganism are related to religions. Evening and lunchtime are times. Fainting and swelling are actions or conditions. So maybe \"Is the word a title of respect?\" If yes, then sir or knight. If no, then others. That splits into 2 and 6 again. But maybe that's useful.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word is a",
