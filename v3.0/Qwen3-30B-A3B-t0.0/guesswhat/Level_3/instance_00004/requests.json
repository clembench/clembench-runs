Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Pineapple, Banana, Melon, Pear, Lemon, Orange, Apricot, Mango.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, maybe think about general characteristics. Like, is the fruit a citrus? Well, Lemon and Orange are citrus. But wait, the user said no questions about structure or specific characteristics. Wait, citrus might be a category. But maybe that's too specific. Let me check the rules again. The questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe things like color, size, type (like citrus, tropical, etc.) are allowed? Or maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about common attributes. For example, \"Does the word have more than 5 letters?\" Let's check the words:\n\nPineapple (9), Banana (6), Melon (5), Pear (4), Lemon (5), Orange (6), Apricot (7), Mango (5). So words with more than 5 letters: Pineapple, Banana, Orange, Apricot. That splits the list into two groups. But maybe that's a good first question. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAnother approach: think about whether the fruit is a citrus. But",
