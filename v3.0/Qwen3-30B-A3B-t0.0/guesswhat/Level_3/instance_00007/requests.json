Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Canoe, Dinghy, Battleship, Destroyer, Tugboat, Ferry, Pontoon, Houseboat.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about meanings or uses. \n\nMaybe start with the size or type of the vessel. For example, asking if it's a type of boat that's typically used for transportation. But wait, all of them are boats. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a large ship. Battleship and Destroyer are military ships, others are more civilian or smaller. But how to phrase that as a yes/no question.\n\nAlternatively, think about whether the word contains 'boat' in it. But that's part of the structure, which is not allowed. So can't ask that. \n\nAnother approach: ask if the word is a type of small boat. Canoe, Dinghy, Tugboat, Ferry, Pontoon, Houseboat. Wait, but some of these might not be small. Maybe not. Alternatively, ask if it's a type of military vessel. Battleship and Destroyer are military. So that's a possible first question.\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a type of military vessel?\n\nIf yes, then it's",
