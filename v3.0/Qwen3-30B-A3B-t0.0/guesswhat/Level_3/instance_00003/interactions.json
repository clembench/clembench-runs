The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Bug', 'Termite', 'Ant', 'Bee', 'Gnat', 'Mosquito', 'Butterfly', 'Moth']",

The words are Bug, Termite, Ant, Bee, Gnat, Mosquito, Butterfly, Moth.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific characteristics, I need to think about general attributes. Maybe things like whether it's an insect, but all of them are insects. Hmm. Maybe their size? But how to phrase that as a yes/no question.\n\nAlternatively, think about their behavior. For example, do they have wings? Let's check: Bug (some bugs have wings, but not all), Termite (yes, they have wings when they're reproductive), Ant (no wings, unless they're queens), Bee (yes), Gnat (yes), Mosquito (yes), Butterfly (yes), Moth (yes). So maybe that's not a good split. But some don't have wings, like Ants. Wait, worker ants don't have wings. So maybe a question like \"Does the target word have wings?\" But then, some might have, some not. Let's see: if I ask that, the answer would be yes for Termite, Bee, Gnat, Mosquito, Butterfly, Moth. No for Bug (some bugs don't have wings, like ladybugs do, but maybe",
