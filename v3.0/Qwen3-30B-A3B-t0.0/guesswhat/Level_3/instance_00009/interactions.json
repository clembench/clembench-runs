The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Carp', 'Catfish', 'Grouper', 'Mackerel', 'Minnow', 'Goldfish']",

The words are Halibut, Flounder, Carp, Catfish, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow, Goldfish.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since the questions can't relate to spelling or structure, I need to think about other attributes. Maybe type of fish? Like freshwater vs saltwater? Or maybe their classification, like if they are bony fish or cartilaginous? Wait, but I don't know if that's allowed. The rules say the questions can't be about structure or spelling, but maybe biological classification is okay.\n\nAlternatively, think about common characteristics. For example, do they have scales? Well, all these are fish, so they all have scales. That's not helpful. What about their habitat? Like, are they typically found in certain environments? For example, some might be in freshwater, others in saltwater. Let's check the list:\n\nHalibut: Saltwater, found in oceans.\nFlounder: Also saltwater.\nCarp: Freshwater.\nCatfish: Can be freshwater or sometimes brackish.\nGrouper: Saltwater.\nMackerel: Saltwater.\nMinnow: Freshwater.\nGoldfish: Freshwater.\n\nSo if I ask if the target is a freshwater fish, that",
