	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Banjo', 'Guitar', 'Drum', 'Cymbal', 'Bugle', 'Trombone', 'Mandolin', 'Harp']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Banjo, Guitar, Drum, Cymbal, Bugle, Trombone, Mandolin, Harp.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about other attributes. Maybe instrument type? Like string, percussion, brass, etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me list the instruments:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Banjo: String (plucked)\\ \tt - Guitar: String (plucked)\\ \tt - Drum: Percussion (hit)\\ \tt - Cymbal: Percussion (hit)\\ \tt - Bugle: Brass (吹奏)\\ \tt - Trombone: Brass (吹奏)\\ \tt - Mandolin: String (plucked)\\ \tt - Harp: String (plucked)\\ \tt \\ \tt So, maybe first ask if it's a string instrument. If yes, then the possible words are Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Harp. If no, then it's Drum, Cymbal, Bugle, Trombone.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the question has to be a yes/no. So the first question could be: "Is the target word a string instrument?" But I need to make sure that the answer is yes or no. However, I'm not sure if all the instruments in the list are correctly categorized. For example, Harp is a string instrument
