I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Banjo, Guitar, Drum, Cymbal, Bugle, Trombone, Mandolin, Harp.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific features, I need to think about other attributes. Maybe instrument type? Like string, percussion, brass, etc.\n\nLet me list the instruments:\n\n- Banjo: String (plucked)\n- Guitar: String (plucked)\n- Drum: Percussion (hit)\n- Cymbal: Percussion (hit)\n- Bugle: Brass (吹奏)\n- Trombone: Brass (吹奏)\n- Mandolin: String (plucked)\n- Harp: String (plucked)\n\nSo, maybe first ask if it's a string instrument. If yes, then the possible words are Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Harp. If no, then it's Drum, Cymbal, Bugle, Trombone.\n\nBut wait, the question has to be a yes/no. So the first question could be: \"Is the target word a string instrument?\" But I need to make sure that the answer is yes or no. However, I'm not sure if all the instruments in the list are correctly categorized. For example, Harp is a string instrument",
