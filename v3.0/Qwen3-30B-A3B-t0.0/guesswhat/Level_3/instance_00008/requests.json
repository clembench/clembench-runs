Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are Reverend, Rabbi, Nun, Monk, Minister, Pastor, Archbishop, Cardinal.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these words might fit into. They all seem to be religious titles. So maybe I can ask about their roles or positions. But the questions can't relate to the word's structure or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about the number of letters or if it's a title. Wait, but the rules say the questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I need to ask about their roles or attributes.\n\nLet me think. Maybe start with a general question. Like, \"Is the target word a religious title?\" But since all of them are, that's not helpful. So maybe a more specific question. For example, \"Is the target word a type of priest?\" But some of them are priests, like Rabbi, Minister, Pastor, etc. But Nun is a female religious person, Monk is male, and Archbishop, Cardinal are higher positions.\n\nAlternatively, think about hierarchy. For example, \"Is the target word a high-ranking religious leader?\" That might eliminate some. Let's see: Archbishop and Cardinal are higher ranks. But Reverend, Rabbi, Monk, Nun, Minister, Pastor are lower. So if the answer is yes, then it's Archbishop",
