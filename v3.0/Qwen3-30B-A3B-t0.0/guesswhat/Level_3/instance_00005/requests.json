Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list using as few yes/no questions as possible, max 7. The words are: Turquoise, Opal, Topaz, Amethyst, Pearl, Ruby, Aquamarine, Emerald.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific characteristics, maybe properties like color, hardness, or type (gemstone vs. something else). Wait, all these are gemstones, right? So maybe color? But how to phrase a yes/no question about color without mentioning the word itself.\n\nWait, the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word. So I can't ask \"Is the word a color?\" because that's a characteristic. Hmm. So maybe I need to think of other attributes. Maybe the origin? Like natural vs. synthetic? But I don't know if that's applicable here. Or maybe the hardness on the Mohs scale? But how to ask that without mentioning specifics.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of letters. But that's a structural characteristic, which is not allowed. So that's out. What about the first letter? But that's part of the structure. So no. \n\nAnother approach: think of common properties of gemstones. For example, some are transparent, some are opaque. But how to ask that? Maybe \"Is the",
