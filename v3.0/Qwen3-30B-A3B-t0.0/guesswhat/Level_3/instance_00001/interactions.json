The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The words are Gardenia, Lilac, Tulip, Lily, Pansy, Violet, Marigold, Petunia.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list into smaller groups. Since I can't ask about spelling or specific characteristics, maybe think about common attributes like type of plant, color, size, or maybe if they are flowers. Wait, all of them are flowers, right? So that's not helpful. Maybe think about whether they are perennials or annuals? But I don't know if that's a yes/no question. Alternatively, maybe ask about the number of letters? But the user said not to ask about structure or spelling. So that's out.\n\nAnother approach: think about common features. For example, do any of them have a specific color? Like \"Is the flower typically blue?\" But I don't know if that's allowed. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe color is a specific characteristic? Hmm, not sure. The user might consider color as a characteristic. Maybe better to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the plant's origin. Like \"Is the flower native to Europe?\" But I don't know if that's a yes/no question. Maybe not. Alternatively, think",
