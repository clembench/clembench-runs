The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Stockings', 'Tights', 'Scarf', 'Shirt', 'Panties', 'Pants', 'Underwear', 'Bra']",

The words are Stockings, Tights, Scarf, Shirt, Panties, Pants, Underwear, Bra.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories these items fall into. They're all clothing items, but maybe I can narrow down by type. Like, maybe start with something like \"Is the item worn on the upper body?\" That could separate things like shirts, scarves, bras from others. Let me check: Scarf is upper body, Shirt is upper, Bra is upper. Stockings, Tights, Pants, Underwear, Panties are lower body. So if the answer is yes, then the target is in that group. If no, then it's the lower body ones. But wait, Scarf is worn around the neck, so maybe that's considered upper body. So first question: \"Is the item worn on the upper body?\" If yes, then possible words are Scarf, Shirt, Bra. If no, then the others. But that might not be the best first question. Alternatively, maybe think about if it's a type of underwear. Underwear is a category that includes Panties, Underwear, maybe Bra? But Bra is also considered underwear. So maybe \"Is the item considered underwear?\" But the list has Underwear, Panties, Bra, and maybe others.",
