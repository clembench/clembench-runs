The CV mentions \"BACHELOR: Economics,\" so the interviewer should know that. But the user also said the recruiter doesn't know about it yet. Wait, the question is about the interviewer, not the recruiter. Hmm, the initial setup says the recruiter doesn't know, but the question is about the interviewer. The user might be mixing up the roles. The CV info is there, so if the interviewer has the CV, they would know. But the user's instruction says the recruiter doesn't know yet. However, the question is about the interviewer, not the recruiter. So the answer depends on whether the interviewer has seen the CV. Since the user hasn't provided info about the interviewer's knowledge, but the CV includes the bachelor's degree, I should assume the interviewer would know if they've reviewed the CV. But the user's setup says the recruiter doesn't know yet. Maybe the user is testing if I can differentiate between recruiter and interviewer. The answer should be no, because the recruiter doesn't know, but the interviewer might. Wait, the question is specifically about the interviewer. Since the user hasn't stated that the interviewer has seen the CV, maybe the answer is no. But the CV is part of the application, so the interviewer would have it. This is a bit confusing. The user wants a yes or no answer",
