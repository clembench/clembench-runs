        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is asking if the interviewer would know the answer to the question about the area studied. Let me check the CV details provided.<br/><br/>The CV mentions &quot;BACHELOR: Music&quot; and &quot;HIGHEST-EDUCATION: Master.&quot; So the person has a bachelor&#x27;s in Music and a Master&#x27;s, but the highest education is a Master&#x27;s, which might be in a different field. However, the question is about the area studied. The interviewer would know the bachelor&#x27;s degree is in Music. But the Master&#x27;s isn&#x27;t specified here. Wait, the user&#x27;s question is about the area studied. If the interviewer is referring to the highest education, they might not know the exact area because the Master&#x27;s isn&#x27;t listed. But the user&#x27;s CV says &quot;HIGHEST-EDUCATION: Master,&quot; but no specific field. So the interviewer might not know the exact area of the Master&#x27;s. However, the question is phrased as &quot;what area you studied,&quot; which could refer to the bachelor&#x27;s. But the user&#x27;s answer needs to be yes or no. Since the Master&#x27;s field isn&#x27;t specified, the interviewer might not know the answer. So the answer would be no. But wait, the user&#x27;s CV says &quot;BACHELOR: Music&quot; and &quot;HIGHEST-EDUCATION: Master.&quot; So the highest education is a Master&#x27;s, but the field isn&#x27;t mentioned.

The CV does have &quot;Music&quot; as the bachelor&#x27;s, so if the question is about the bachelor&#x27;s, the answer is yes. But the question is general. Hmm. The user might be testing if the answer is clear. Since the CV states &quot;BACHELOR: Music,&quot; the answer is yes. But the Master&#x27;s isn&#x27;t specified. However, the question is about the area studied, which could refer to the highest education. But the highest education is Master,</p>
