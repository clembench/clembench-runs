The user also mentioned that the recruiter doesn't know about it yet. \n\nWait, the initial instruction says the recruiter doesn't know about the CV details. So the interviewer (recruiter) isn't aware of the bachelor's degree. The user is asking if the interviewer knows, so the answer should be no. \n\nBut I need to make sure. The user's CV has the info, but the recruiter hasn't been told yet. So the answer is no. The user wants a yes or no answer, then stop. So the response should be \"no\" followed by a period.
