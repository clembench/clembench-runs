They want the answer in the form of "ANSWER: <one sentence>" and also have me answer with "ASIDE: <one sentence>".\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to check if the user's question is about whether the travel agent has been informed. According to the initial setup, the travel agent does not know about the travel details yet. So the answer should be "no".\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user is asking me if I have informed the travel agent. Since I'm the customer, I haven't informed them yet. So the answer is "no". Then, the user wants an aside, which is a separate note. The aside should be a single sentence, maybe explaining that the travel agent hasn't been informed yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure the answers are short and direct. The user emphasized that. So the answer is "no" and the aside is a brief explanation. Let me structure that properly.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: No.  \\ \tt ASIDE: The travel agent has not been informed about the travel details yet
