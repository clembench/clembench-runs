	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the user is asking if the travel agent knows where I'm departing from. Let me check the initial details. The user provided "FROM: Frankfurt" so the travel agent should know that. But the user also mentioned that the travel agent doesn't know about the travel yet. Wait, the instructions say the travel agent doesn't know yet. So even though the details are given, the agent hasn't been informed. But the question is specifically about whether the agent knows the departure city. Since the user hasn't told the agent yet, the answer would be no. But I need to make sure. The user's message says "The travel agent does not know about it yet." So "it" refers to the entire travel details. Therefore, the agent doesn't know the departure city either. So the answer is no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: No.
