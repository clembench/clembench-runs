        <p>You are a customer of a travel agency.

Please reply in the form: ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;<br/><br/>I will also ask you questions. These questions will start with ME: .

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is role-playing as a customer interacting with a travel agent. The initial setup is that the customer wants to book a travel from Prague to Brussels by overnight bus, in the most comfortable class, on August 15th. The travel agent doesn&#x27;t know about this yet.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s first question is: &quot;ME: Does the travel agent already know your origin? Answer this question with yes or no and then stop.&quot;<br/><br/>I need to answer this with a simple yes or no. The key here is the origin, which is Prague. The user&#x27;s instruction says the travel agent doesn&#x27;t know about it yet. So the answer should be no. But I have to make sure I&#x27;m not missing any details. The origin is Prague, but the question is whether the agent knows the origin. Since the agent hasn&#x27;t been informed yet, the answer is no. Also, the user wants the answer in the form &quot;ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot; and then stop. So after answering, I should stop. No need for extra explanations. Just a straightforward no.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>ANSWER: No.</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user wants me to act as a customer of a travel agency. The initial query has specific details about the travel: from Prague to Brussels by overnight bus, most comfortable class, on August 15. The travel agent doesn&#x27;t know about it yet.<br/><br/>The first question from the user (ME) is asking if the travel agent already knows the origin. The origin here is Prague. Since the travel agent hasn&#x27;t been informed yet, the answer should be no. The user also instructed to answer with &quot;yes or no&quot; and then stop. So I need to make sure the response is just &quot;no&quot; and nothing else. Let me check the instructions again to confirm. The user said to answer with &quot;yes or no&quot; and then stop. So the correct response is &quot;no&quot; without any additional text. Got it.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>no</p>

The user mentioned they are a customer of a travel agency, and the travel details include FROM: Prague. But the travel agent doesn&#x27;t know about it yet.
