The initial setup is that the customer wants to book a travel from Prague to Brussels by overnight bus, in the most comfortable class, on August 15th. The travel agent doesn't know about this yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's first question is: "ME: Does the travel agent already know your origin? Answer this question with yes or no and then stop."\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to answer this with a simple yes or no. The key here is the origin, which is Prague. The user's instruction says the travel agent doesn't know about it yet. So the answer should be no. But I have to make sure I'm not missing any details. The origin is Prague, but the question is whether the agent knows the origin. Since the agent hasn't been informed yet, the answer is no. Also, the user wants the answer in the form "ANSWER: <one sentence>" and then stop. So after answering, I should stop. No need for extra explanations. Just a straightforward no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: No.
