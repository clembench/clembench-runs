But wait, the user is acting as the customer, so maybe they haven't spoken to the waiter. The initial description says the waiter doesn't know yet. So the answer is no. Need to make sure I'm not assuming any prior interaction. The user's instruction says to answer with yes or no and then stop. So the correct response is "no" followed by a stop. But the example in the problem shows the assistant's answer as "ANSWER: no" and then stops. So I should follow that format.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: no
