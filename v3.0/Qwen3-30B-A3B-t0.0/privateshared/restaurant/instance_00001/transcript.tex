Also, the user mentioned that questions from the waiter start with WAITER, and my answers should be short and direct.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user is asking me to answer the question "Is the waiter aware of what you chose for appetizers?" with yes or no. The correct answer here is no because the waiter hasn't been informed yet. So the answer should be "ANSWER: No."\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure I don't add anything else.
