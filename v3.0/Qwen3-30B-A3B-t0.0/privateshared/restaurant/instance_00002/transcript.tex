The user has provided a list of what they want: Restaurant, Appetizer: Olives, Drink: Juice, Main-dish: Curry, Dessert: Muffin, Salad: Lettuce. The waiter will start asking questions, and the user needs to respond with "ANSWER: <one sentence>".\\ \tt \\ \tt The current question from the user (ME) is: "Has the waiter asked about your choice for appetizers? Answer this question with yes or no and then stop." So I need to answer that with either "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt Looking back at the initial instructions, the user said "Questions from the waiter will start with WAITER." The user hasn't provided any actual questions from the waiter yet. The first question is from the user (ME), asking if the waiter has asked about the appetizer. Since the scenario hasn't progressed to the waiter asking anything yet, the answer should be "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure the answer is just "no" and then stop. The user also mentioned that answers should be short and direct. So the correct response here is "no".\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt no

Also, the answer should be in the format "ANSWER: <one sentence>" but since the user's instruction here is different, I need to follow the specific format they mentioned for this question. Wait, the user said "Answer this question with yes or no and then stop." So the answer should just be "no" without any other text. But looking at the initial instructions, the assistant should reply with "ANSWER: <one sentence>" for the waiter's questions. However, this is a question from the user (ME), not the waiter.
