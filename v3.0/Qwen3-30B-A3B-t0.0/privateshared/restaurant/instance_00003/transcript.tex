The initial description lists the order: Antipasti as the appetizer, Tea as the drink, Lasagna as the main dish, Shortcake as dessert, and Tomato as the salad. The waiter doesn't know about this yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt The first question from the user (ME) is asking if the waiter already knows the preference for appetizers. I need to answer with "yes" or "no" and then stop. Since the setup says the waiter doesn't know yet, the answer should be "no." But I have to make sure to follow the format: ANSWER: <one sentence>. Also, the user mentioned that questions from the waiter start with WAITER, and my answers should be in the specified format. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user also said to answer the ME questions with ASIDE: <one sentence>. But the current question is from ME, so I need to respond with ASIDE: no. However, the user's instruction says "Answer these questions with: ASIDE: <one sentence>". So the answer here should be ASIDE: no. But the initial example might have different formatting. Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's message says: "Please reply in the form: ANSWER: <one sentence>" for the waiter's questions. For the user's questions (ME:), answer with "ASIDE: <one sentence>". So the current question is ME: so
