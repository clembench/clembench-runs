        <p>You are a customer in a restaurant.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is asking if the waiter already knows my preference for appetizers. Let me check the initial description. The user provided a list of what they want: Appetizer is Antipasti, Drink is Tea, Main-dish is Lasagna, Dessert is Shortcake, Salad is Tomato. But the waiter doesn&#x27;t know about it yet. So the answer should be no. The user wants a yes or no answer followed by stopping. I need to make sure I only answer with &quot;no&quot; and then stop. No extra explanations. Got it.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>no</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is asking if the waiter already knows my preference for appetizers. Let me check the initial description. The user listed &quot;APPETIZER: Antipasti&quot; but mentioned that the waiter doesn&#x27;t know about it yet. So the answer should be no. I need to respond with &quot;no&quot; and then stop. Make sure it&#x27;s a single sentence.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>ANSWER: No.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Answerer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg a-gm" style="border: dashed">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user wants me to act as a customer in a restaurant. The initial description lists the order: Antipasti as the appetizer, Tea as the drink, Lasagna as the main dish, Shortcake as dessert, and Tomato as the salad. The waiter doesn&#x27;t know about this yet.<br/><br/>The first question from the user (ME) is asking if the waiter already knows the preference for appetizers. I need to answer with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and then stop. Since the setup says the waiter doesn&#x27;t know yet, the answer should be &quot;no.&quot; But I have to make sure to follow the format: ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;. Also, the user mentioned that questions from the waiter start with WAITER, and my answers should be in the specified format. <br/><br/>Wait, the user also said to answer the ME questions with ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;. But the current question is from ME, so I need to respond with ASIDE: no. However, the user&#x27;s instruction says &quot;Answer these questions with: ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot;. So the answer here should be ASIDE: no. But the initial example might have different formatting. Let me check again.<br/><br/>The user&#x27;s message says: &quot;Please reply in the form: ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot; for the waiter&#x27;s questions. For the user&#x27;s questions (ME:), answer with &quot;ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot;. So the current question is ME: so</p>
