According to the scenario, the waiter doesn't know yet, and the questions from the waiter are about to start. The user's question is whether the waiter has already asked about the appetizer. Since the waiter hasn't started asking yet, the answer should be \"no\". The user wants a short, direct answer, so \"ANSWER: no\" would be appropriate. Then, since the user is asking a question, the assistant should also provide an aside. The aside should be a single sentence, maybe explaining the reasoning, but the user's instruction says to answer the question with yes or no and then stop. Wait, the user",
