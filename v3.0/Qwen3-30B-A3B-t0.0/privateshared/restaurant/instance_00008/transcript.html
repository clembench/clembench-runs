        <p>You are a customer in a restaurant.

Please reply in the form: ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;<br/><br/>I will also ask you questions. These questions will start with ME: . Please answer these questions with: ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;<br/><br/>Important: Give short, direct answers!<br/><br/>Let us start.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (Answerer) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg a-gm" style="border: dashed">
        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is playing a role-playing game where they&#x27;re a customer in a restaurant. The setup is that the waiter doesn&#x27;t know their order yet. The user has provided a list of what they want: Restaurant, Appetizer: Cheese, Drink: Water, Main-dish: Biryani, Dessert: Muffin, Salad: Greek.<br/><br/>The first question from the user (ME) is asking if the waiter has asked about the appetizer choice. The instructions say to answer with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and then stop. The key here is to check if the waiter has already asked. Since the scenario starts with the waiter not knowing the order yet, and the questions from the waiter are about to begin, the answer should be &quot;no&quot;. The user wants a short, direct answer, so just &quot;no&quot; followed by stopping. I need to make sure not to add any extra information. The response should be in the format &quot;ANSWER: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot; but the user&#x27;s question here is different. Wait, the user&#x27;s message starts with ME: and they want the answer to their question with &quot;ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot;. Wait, looking back at the initial instructions: &quot;Please answer these questions with: ASIDE: &lt;one sentence&gt;&quot;. So the user&#x27;s question is ME: ... and the answer should be ASIDE: ... <br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s current question is &quot;Has the waiter asked about your choice for appetizers?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is playing a role-playing game where they&#x27;re a customer in a restaurant. The setup is that the waiter hasn&#x27;t been informed of the order yet. The user&#x27;s previous message was a question to me, asking if the waiter has asked about the appetizer choice. The instructions say to answer with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and then stop.<br/><br/>First, I need to check the conversation history. The user provided a description of what they want to order, including an appetizer of Cheese. The waiter hasn&#x27;t been told yet. The user&#x27;s question is whether the waiter has asked about the appetizer. Since the waiter hasn&#x27;t started asking yet, the answer should be &quot;no.&quot; <br/><br/>But I need to make sure I&#x27;m not missing any previous interactions. The user mentioned that the waiter&#x27;s questions will start with &quot;WAITER,&quot; and the user&#x27;s questions start with &quot;ME.&quot; In the current exchange, the user is asking me a question, not the waiter. So the waiter hasn&#x27;t asked anything yet. Therefore, the answer is &quot;no.&quot; <br/><br/>I should respond with &quot;ANSWER: no&quot; as per the instructions. The user also mentioned that after the waiter&#x27;s questions, I should reply in the specified format. But since this is the user&#x27;s question, not the waiter&#x27;s, I just need to answer &quot;no&quot; and stop. No need for any additional text. Let me confirm once more: the waiter hasn&#x27;t asked anything yet, so</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user wants me to act as a customer in a restaurant.
