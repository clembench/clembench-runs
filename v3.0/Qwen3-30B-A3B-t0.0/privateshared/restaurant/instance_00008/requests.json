The instructions say to answer with \"yes\" or \"no\" and then stop. The key here is to check if the waiter has already asked. Since the scenario starts with the waiter not knowing the order yet, and the questions from the waiter are about to begin, the answer should be \"no\". The user wants a short, direct answer, so just \"no\" followed by stopping. I need to make sure not to add any extra information. The response should be in the format \"ANSWER: <one sentence>\" but the user's question here is different. Wait, the user's message starts with ME: and they want the answer to their question with \"ASIDE: <one sentence>\".

So the user's question is ME: ... and the answer should be ASIDE: ... \n\nBut the user's current question is \"Has the waiter asked about your choice for appetizers?",
