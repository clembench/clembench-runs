So the left side has nail polish. But the question says the questioner doesn&#x27;t know about the things yet. So even though I know the answer, the questioner hasn&#x27;t been informed. The answer should be no. Need to make sure I&#x27;m not assuming the questioner has the info. They might not have seen the list yet. So the answer is no.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>ANSWER: No.</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is asking if the questioner knows what&#x27;s on my left. From the given information, the left is nail polish. But the questioner hasn&#x27;t been told that yet. The setup says things are in different places, but the questioner doesn&#x27;t know about it yet. So even though I know the answer, the questioner doesn&#x27;t. So the answer should be no. I need to make sure I&#x27;m not assuming the questioner has the information.
