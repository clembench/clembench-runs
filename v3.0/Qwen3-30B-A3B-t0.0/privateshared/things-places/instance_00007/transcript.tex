So even though the left is listed as nail polish, the questioner isn't aware of these placements. Therefore, the answer should be no. The user wants a yes or no answer followed by stopping. I need to make sure I don't add anything else. Just "no" and then stop. Let me confirm again. The questioner doesn't know the locations, so they wouldn't know the left has nail polish.
