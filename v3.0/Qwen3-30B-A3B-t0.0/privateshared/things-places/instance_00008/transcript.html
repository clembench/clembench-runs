So, according to the data provided, the left side has a cherry. But the question says the questioner doesn&#x27;t know about the things yet. So even though the information is there, the questioner isn&#x27;t aware. <br/><br/>The user wants a yes or no answer. Since the questioner hasn&#x27;t been told, the answer should be no. I need to make sure I&#x27;m not assuming the questioner has access to the list. The key point is that the questioner doesn&#x27;t know, so the answer is no.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>ANSWER: no</p>
