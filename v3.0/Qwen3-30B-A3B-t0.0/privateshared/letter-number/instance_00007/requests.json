The initial message says that numbers have been assigned to letters, but the questioner doesn't know about it yet. So the mapping is given, but the questioner isn't aware. The user's question is whether the questioner knows the number for 'a'. Since the questioner hasn't been told about the numbering, the answer should be no.
