The user said to reply in the form "ANSWER: <one sentence>" and for the questions starting with ME, answer with "ASIDE: <one sentence>". But in this case, the user is asking the questioner, so the answer should be "ANSWER: no" and then stop. Wait, the user's message says "Please answer this question with yes or no and then stop." So after the answer, I should stop. But the previous instructions mention that answers to the questioner's questions should be in "ANSWER: ..." and the user's own questions (ME) with "ASIDE: ...". However, the user is now asking the questioner, so maybe it's an ANSWER. But the user's exact instruction here is "Answer
