The user wants a yes or no answer followed by stopping.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to confirm the information provided. The mapping is there, but the questioner hasn't been told. So the answer should be no. The user also specified to answer with "ANSWER: <one sentence>" and then stop. So I should just say "ANSWER: no" and end it there. No need for extra explanations. Let me make sure I'm not missing any hidden details. The question is straightforward. The answer is no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: no
