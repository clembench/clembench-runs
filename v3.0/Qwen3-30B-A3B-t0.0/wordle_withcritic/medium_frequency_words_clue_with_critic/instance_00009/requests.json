The user gave the clue \"waffle topping\". I need to think of a five-letter word that's a topping for a waffle. Common waffle toppings include things like syrup, butter, fruits, etc. But syrup is 6 letters. Wait, maybe \"syrup\" is too long. Let me think. Oh, \"jam\" is three letters. Not enough. \"Custard\" is too long. \"Whip\" is four letters. \"Cream\" is five letters. Wait, cream is a possible topping. But is there another? Maybe \"sugar\"? But that's five letters. Or \"butter\"? But that's six letters. Wait, \"butter\" is six. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"milk\"? No, that's not a topping. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a play on words. \"Waffle topping\" could refer to something else. Wait, maybe \"waffle\" itself is part of the word? Or maybe \"topping\" is a hint. Alternatively, think of the word \"syrup\" but it's six letters. Maybe the answer is \"syrup\" but the user said five letters. Wait, maybe \"syrup\" is spelled with five letters? Let me check. S-Y-R-U-P: that's five letters. Oh, right! Syrup is five letters. So maybe the answer is \"syrup\". But",
