And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

The user gave the clue \"virile\" and I need to guess the target word. The example they provided was using a fairy tale reference, so maybe I should think of words related to \"virile\" in some context.\n\nFirst, \"virile\" means having or showing strong, healthy masculinity. Maybe a word related to strength or male figures. But how does that translate to a 5-letter word? Let me think of synonyms. Words like \"manly\" or \"stout\" but those might not fit. Wait, the example used \"apple\" from Snow White. Maybe there's a story or a common phrase associated with \"virile\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a play on words. \"Virile\" itself is 6 letters, but the target is 5. Maybe a word that's part of a phrase with \"virile\"? Or a word that's related in meaning. Let me think of 5-letter words related to strength. \"Brave\"? \"Strong\" is 6 letters. \"Power\" is 5. But how does that connect to \"virile\"?\n\nWait, maybe it's a proper noun. Like a name of a character known for being virile. For example, \"Hercules\" but that's too long. Maybe \"Ares\" but that's 4 letters. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the word \"viral\" but that's not related. Or \"v",
