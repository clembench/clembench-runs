You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess.

The user gave the clue \"tick off\". I need to think of a five-letter word related to that phrase. \"Tick off\" can mean to annoy someone, but maybe there's a specific word here. Let me think... Words that are synonyms for \"tick off\" could be \"annoy\", but that's five letters. Wait, \"annoy\" is five letters. Let me check: A-N-N-O-Y. Yes, that's five. But maybe there's another possibility. Alternatively, \"irritate\" is too long. \"Pique\" is another synonym, but that's five letters too. P-I-Q-U-E. But \"pique\" might not be as directly related. The example given was \"apple\" for \"snowy white\", so maybe the answer is a direct synonym. Let me go with \"annoy\" as the guess. But wait, the clue is \"tick off\" as a phrase. Maybe the answer is \"off\" but that's three letters. No, needs five. Alternatively, \"angry\" but that's more of a state. Hmm. Alternatively, \"rile\" but that's four letters. Wait, \"irritate\" is too long. Maybe \"nag\" but again too short. Alternatively, \"bug\" but same issue. Wait, maybe the answer is \"annoy\" as the closest five-letter word. So I'll go with that.\n",
