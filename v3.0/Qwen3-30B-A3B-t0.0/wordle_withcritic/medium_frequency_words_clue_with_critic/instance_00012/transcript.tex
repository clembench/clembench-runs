	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like venture capital investments

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "like venture capital investments." Hmm. Venture capital investments are usually high-risk, high-reward. Maybe the word is something related to that. Let me think. Words that describe investments? Maybe "risky"? But that's not five letters. Wait, "startups" are often funded by venture capital. But that's six letters. What about "angel"? No, that's four letters. Or "funds"? But that's five letters. Wait, "angel" is four. Maybe "stock"? No, that's more general. Or "shares"? Five letters. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the word might be "beta" but that's four letters. Wait, maybe "lever" as in leverage? Not sure. Or "scale" as in scaling a startup? Not sure. Alternatively, think of the term "VC" which stands for venture capital, but that's two letters. Maybe the word is "invest" but that's six letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think again. The clue is "like venture capital investments." Maybe the word is "risky" but that's five letters. Or "speculative"? Too long. "High risk" but that's two words. Maybe "bold" but that's four letters. Alternatively, think of the word "start" but that's not directly related. Wait, maybe "funds" as in
