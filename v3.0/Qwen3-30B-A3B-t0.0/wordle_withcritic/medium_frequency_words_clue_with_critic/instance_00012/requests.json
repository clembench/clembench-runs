The clue is \"like venture capital investments.\" Hmm. Venture capital investments are usually high-risk, high-reward. Maybe the word is something related to that. Let me think. Words that describe investments? Maybe \"risky\"? But that's not five letters. Wait, \"startups\" are often funded by venture capital. But that's six letters. What about \"angel\"? No, that's four letters. Or \"funds\"? But that's five letters. Wait, \"angel\" is four. Maybe \"stock\"? No, that's more general. Or \"shares\"? Five letters. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the word might be \"beta\" but that's four letters. Wait, maybe \"lever\" as in leverage? Not sure. Or \"scale\" as in scaling a startup? Not sure. Alternatively, think of the term \"VC\" which stands for venture capital, but that's two letters. Maybe the word is \"invest\" but that's six letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think again. The clue is \"like venture capital investments.\" Maybe the word is \"risky\" but that's five letters. Or \"speculative\"? Too long. \"High risk\" but that's two words. Maybe \"bold\" but that's four letters. Alternatively, think of the word \"start\" but that's not directly related. Wait, maybe \"funds\" as in",
