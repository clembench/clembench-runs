	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: shrewd

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user gave the clue "shrewd" and wants me to guess the target word. The example they provided was using a fairy tale reference, so maybe I need to think of a word related to "shrewd" in some way.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "shrewd" means clever or sharp, but maybe there's a play on words here. Let me think of synonyms or related terms. Words like "sharp," "clever," "astute," but those are all similar in meaning. Alternatively, maybe a word that's part of a phrase or a title. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example used "apple" because of the Snow White story. So maybe the clue is a hint towards a specific word. Let me think of words that are 5 letters and related to "shrewd." \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: maybe the word is a synonym. Let's check synonyms for shrewd. Words like "sly," "cunning," "wily," "shrewd" itself is 6 letters, so not that. "Wily" is 4 letters. "Cunning" is 7. "Sharp" is 5 letters. But "sharp" is a possible guess. But how does that connect to the clue? The clue is "shrewd," so maybe the answer is a synonym. But the example used a direct reference, not a synonym. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the clue is a hint
