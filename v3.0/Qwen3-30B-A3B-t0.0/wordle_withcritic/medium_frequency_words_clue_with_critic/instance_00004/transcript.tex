	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: pilsner

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user gave me the clue "pilsner" and I need to guess the target word. The target is a 5-letter English word. The example they provided was using a clue from a fairy tale, so maybe "pilsner" is a hint towards a word related to that.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about what "pilsner" refers to. A pilsner is a type of beer, right? So maybe the target word is related to beer or something associated with it. But the target word has to be 5 letters. Let me think of 5-letter words related to beer. There's "ale" but that's 3 letters. "Lager" is 5 letters. Wait, lager is a type of beer. But how does that connect to "pilsner"? Pilsner is a specific type of lager. Maybe the answer is "lager"? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a play on words. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given was "snowy white" leading to "apple" because of Snow White. So maybe "pilsner" is a hint towards a word that's part of the word "pilsner". Let me break down "pilsner". It's p-i-l-s-n-e-r. But the target is 5 letters. Maybe taking parts of it. For example, "pilsn" is
