The clue given is \"nine-to-five routine.\" Hmm, I need to think about what that phrase means. A nine-to-five routine refers to a typical office job, right? So maybe the target word is related to work or a job. But it's a five-letter word.\n\nWait, the example given earlier was \"apple\" based on the clue about Snow White. So maybe I need to think of a five-letter word that's associated with the clue. Let's break down \"nine-to-five routine.\" The phrase is often used to describe a regular, mundane job. Words like \"work,\" \"job,\" \"office,\" but those are too short or not five letters. \n\nWait, \"routine\" itself is seven letters. Maybe the answer is a synonym for routine? Like \"habit\" (5 letters), \"task\" (4), \"duty\" (4). Not quite. Or maybe a word that's part of the nine-to-five job. Like \"desk\" (4), \"chair\" (5), but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, think of the phrase \"nine-to-five\" as a time frame. Maybe the word is \"shift\" (5 letters), but that's more about a work period. Or \"clock\" (5 letters), but that's not directly related. \n\nWait, the example used a word from a fairy tale. Maybe this clue is referencing something else. \"",
