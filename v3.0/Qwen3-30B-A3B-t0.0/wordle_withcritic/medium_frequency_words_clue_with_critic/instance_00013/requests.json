The clue is \"baby conveyance.\" Hmm, so I need to think of a five-letter word that refers to something used to carry a baby. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, \"baby\" is the key here. Common items related to babies... Maybe a stroller? But that's seven letters. How about \"pram\"? Yes, a pram is a baby carriage. Let me check the letters: P-R-A-M. Wait, that's four letters. Oh, maybe \"prams\"? But that's plural. The target word is five letters. Wait, maybe \"stroller\" is too long. What else?\n\nAnother thought: \"carriage\" is too long. \"Buggy\"? That's five letters. B-U-G-G-Y. Yes, a baby buggy. But is \"buggy\" the correct term? Or maybe \"carseat\"? No, that's longer. Wait, \"baby carrier\" is two words. Maybe \"sling\"? But that's five letters. S-L-I-N-G. But I'm not sure if that's considered a conveyance. \n\nAlternatively, \"toddler\" is not a conveyance. Wait, \"pushchair\" is another term, but again longer. Let me think again. The clue says \"conveyance,\" which means something that carries. So maybe \"cart\"? No, too short. \"Cradle\"? That's five letters.",
