You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess.

The clue is \"stand in (for)\". Hmm, so I need to think of a five-letter word that fits this clue. The phrase \"stand in for\" usually means to replace someone or something. Like, if someone can't do a job, another person stands in for them. But what's a five-letter word that means that?\n\nWait, the example given earlier was \"apple\" for the clue \"snowy white\", which was from Snow White. So maybe this is a reference to a common phrase or a title. \"Stand in for\" could be a phrase from a movie, book, or a common expression. Let me think of synonyms for \"stand in for\". Words like \"substitute\", but that's too long. \"Proxy\" is another, but that's five letters. Wait, \"proxy\" is five letters: p-r-o-x-y. But does that fit the clue? \"Stand in for\" could be a proxy. But maybe there's another word.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a play on words. The phrase \"stand in\" could be part of a longer phrase. For example, \"stand in\" as in a substitute, but maybe the word is \"stand\" itself? No, that's five letters but the clue is \"stand in (for)\", so maybe \"stand\" is part of it. Wait, but the target word is five letters. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: \"",
