	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: gauge reading

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user provided the clue "gauge reading". I need to think about what that could mean. A gauge is a device that measures something, like a car's speed or fuel. A reading would be the value shown on the gauge. So maybe the target word is related to a measurement or a specific term used in gauges.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should consider words that are synonyms for gauge. Words like "meter" come to mind, but that's five letters. Wait, "meter" is five letters. But "gauge" itself is five letters, but the clue is "gauge reading", so maybe it's not the same word. Alternatively, "scale" is another term for a gauge, but that's five letters too. Or "level" as in a gauge of liquid. But I need to think of a five-letter word that's a reading from a gauge.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "gauge" can also mean to measure, so maybe the word is "read" but that's four letters. Or "mark" as in a measurement. Wait, "mark" is four letters. Hmm. What about "index"? That's five letters. An index can be a reading on a gauge. Or "point" as in a pointer on a gauge. But "point" is five letters. Alternatively, "value" as in the value shown on a gauge. But "value" is five letters. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the
