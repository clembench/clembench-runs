	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: 1985 hit by heart

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user gave a clue: "1985 hit by heart". I need to figure out the target word based on this.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "1985 hit" – maybe a song or movie from 1985? "Hit" could mean a popular song. "By heart" might be part of the title. Wait, "Heart" is a band. Oh, Heart had a song called "Alone" in 1985. But "Alone" is 5 letters. Let me check. A-L-O-N-E. Yes, that's five letters. But wait, the clue says "hit by heart". Maybe "Heart" is part of the title. Alternatively, maybe "Hearts" but that's six letters. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of "1985 hit" as a movie. But "By Heart" could be a movie? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the word is "heart" itself, but the clue says "hit by heart". Maybe the word is "heart", but the clue is a bit confusing. Wait, the example given was "snowy white" leading to "apple" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a reference to a story or song. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "1985 hit by heart" – maybe the song "Take On Me" by a-ha, but that's 1985. But
