The user gave a clue: \"1985 hit by heart\". I need to figure out the target word based on this.\n\nFirst, \"1985 hit\" – maybe a song or movie from 1985? \"Hit\" could mean a popular song. \"By heart\" might be part of the title. Wait, \"Heart\" is a band. Oh, Heart had a song called \"Alone\" in 1985. But \"Alone\" is 5 letters. Let me check. A-L-O-N-E. Yes, that's five letters. But wait, the clue says \"hit by heart\". Maybe \"Heart\" is part of the title. Alternatively, maybe \"Hearts\" but that's six letters. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of \"1985 hit\" as a movie. But \"By Heart\" could be a movie? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the word is \"heart\" itself, but the clue says \"hit by heart\". Maybe the word is \"heart\", but the clue is a bit confusing. Wait, the example given was \"snowy white\" leading to \"apple\" because of Snow White. So maybe the clue is a reference to a story or song. \n\nWait, \"1985 hit by heart\" – maybe the song \"Take On Me\" by a-ha, but that's 1985. But",
