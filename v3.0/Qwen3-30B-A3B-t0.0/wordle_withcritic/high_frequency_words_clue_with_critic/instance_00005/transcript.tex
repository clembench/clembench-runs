	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: divine ___

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the user gave the clue "divine ___". So I need to think of a five-letter word that follows "divine". Let's see. The word "divine" itself is six letters, but the target is five. Wait, the clue is "divine ___", which might be a phrase. Maybe it's a common phrase or a word that comes after "divine".\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, "divine" could be part of a longer word. Wait, but the target word is five letters. Let me think. Maybe "divine" is the first part, but then the word would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the clue is hinting at a word that's related to "divine" but not necessarily starting with it. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given was "snowy white" leading to "apple". So maybe the clue is a hint towards the word. For instance, "divine" could relate to something like "angel" or "heaven", but those are five letters. Let me check: "angel" is five letters. But how does "divine" relate to "angel"? Maybe because angels are considered divine. Alternatively, "divine" could be part of a phrase like "divine spark" or something, but that's longer.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: maybe the clue is a play on words. "Divine" as in "divine" (verb) meaning to foresee, but that's not helpful.
