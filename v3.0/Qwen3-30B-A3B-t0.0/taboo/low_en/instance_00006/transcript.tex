	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "spoon," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: eating, dinner, bowl. Let's think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what's a spoon used for? It's a utensil for eating. But "eating" is a related word, so I can't mention that. Maybe focus on its shape. A spoon has a handle and a bowl-shaped part. Wait, "bowl" is also a related word. Hmm, so I can't use "bowl" either. Need to find another way to describe the shape.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe talk about the function. It's used to scoop or stir. But "scoop" might be too similar. Or maybe mention that it's a kitchen tool. But "kitchen" isn't listed as a related word. Wait, the related words are eating, dinner, bowl. So "kitchen" is okay. But the user said to avoid the target word and related words. So "kitchen" is safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. Like "utensil," but that's a bit generic. Or "silverware," but that might be too specific. Wait, the other player needs to guess "spoon," so maybe describe its physical features. Like "a curved metal tool with a handle used for eating." But "eating" is a related word. Oh no, can't use that. So rephrase: "a curved tool with
