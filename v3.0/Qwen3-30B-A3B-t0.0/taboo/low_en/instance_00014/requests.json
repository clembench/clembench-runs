Let me think.\n\nFirst, what defines a statue? It's a three-dimensional representation of a person, animal, or object, usually made of materials like stone, metal, or wood. It's often placed in public spaces or as art. But I can't say \"sculpture\" or \"monument.\" Maybe focus on the material or the purpose.\n\nAlternative clues: \"A carved representation of a person or thing, typically made of stone or metal.\" Wait, but \"carved\" might be too vague. Or \"A static, life-sized depiction made from durable materials.\" Hmm, but \"static\" isn't the best term. Maybe \"A three-dimensional artwork that's usually placed in a public area.\" But \"artwork\" could be too broad. \n\nWait, the related words are sculpture, monument, figure. So I need to avoid those. Let me think of synonyms or attributes. Maybe \"A solid, human or animal form created to last, often in public spaces.\" But \"form\" might be too generic. Or \"A permanent, physical depiction of a person or creature, made from materials like stone.\" That's better. But I need to make it concise. \n\nAnother angle: think about how it's used. \"A representation of a person or thing, made to stand in a",
