	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "valium," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words like "sleep," "narcotic," or "diazepam." Let me think. Valium is a brand name for diazepam, which is a benzodiazepine. But I can't mention diazepam. So maybe focus on its effects. It's used for anxiety, muscle relaxation, or seizures. But how to describe that without using the related words?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words include "narcotic," but Valium isn't a narcotic; it's a benzodiazepine. Maybe I should avoid that term. Let me think of synonyms. Maybe "muscle relaxant" or "anti-anxiety medication." But I need to be concise. Also, the user said to be short and to the point.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: Valium is a medication, so maybe "prescription drug" but that's too vague. Or "commonly prescribed for anxiety." But maybe the other player knows it's a brand name. Alternatively, think of its classification. Benzodiazepine, but I can't use that term? Wait, the related words are sleep, narcotic, diazepam. So benzodiazepine isn't listed, so maybe that's allowed. But I'm not sure. Let me check the rules again. The user said not to use the target word or related words
