	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt den\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - cave\\ \tt - nest\\ \tt - lair\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "den," and the related words are cave, nest, and lair. The user can't use the target word or any of those related words. So I need to think of synonyms or related concepts without hitting those exact terms.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "den" is a place where an animal lives, like a fox's den. But I can't say "cave," "nest," or "lair." Maybe think of other terms. What's another word for a animal's dwelling? Maybe "habitat," but that's a bit broad. Or "shelter"? But "shelter" is pretty general. Wait, the user wants short and to the point. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the function. A den is a safe place. Maybe "safe spot" or "hiding place." But maybe too vague. Or "animal's home." But "home" might be too generic. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "den" can also mean a room in a house, like a family room. But the related words are more about animal shelters. So maybe focus on the animal aspect. \\ \tt \\ \tt What's a synonym for den that's not in the related words? Maybe "burrow"? But is "burrow" considered a related word here? The user didn't list it, so maybe it's okay. But I need to check if "burrow" is allowed. The rules say not to use the target word
