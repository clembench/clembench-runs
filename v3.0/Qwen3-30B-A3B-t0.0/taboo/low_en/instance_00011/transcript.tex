	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "startup," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: beginning, organization, company. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what's a startup? It's a new business venture, right? But I can't say "company" or "organization." Maybe focus on the early stage. Words like "new," "young," "emerging" could work. Also, maybe mention it's a business that's just starting. But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Avoid "beginning" as well. So instead of "early stage," maybe "newly established" or "nascent." But "nascent" might be too obscure. What's another term? "Pioneer" or "innovative" maybe? Wait, the user said to be short and to the point.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe "new business venture" but "venture" is okay? Let me check the rules. The related words are beginning, organization, company. So "venture" isn't listed, so it's allowed. But maybe "new business" is better. But "business" isn't a related word. Wait, the related words are beginning, organization, company. So "business" is okay. But "startup" is the target. So maybe "new business" but that's too vague. What's another angle?\\ \tt \\ \tt Startups are often innovative, maybe "innovative enterprise"? But "enterprise" isn't a related word
