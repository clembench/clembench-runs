Words like \"new,\" \"young,\" \"emerging\" could work. Also, maybe mention it's a business that's just starting. But I need to be concise.\n\nAvoid \"beginning\" as well. So instead of \"early stage,\" maybe \"newly established\" or \"nascent.\" But \"nascent\" might be too obscure. What's another term? \"Pioneer\" or \"innovative\" maybe? Wait, the user said to be short and to the point.\n\nMaybe \"new business venture\" but \"venture\" is okay? Let me check the rules. The related words are beginning, organization, company. So \"venture\" isn't listed, so it's allowed. But maybe \"new business\" is better. But \"business\" isn't a related word. Wait, the related words are beginning, organization, company. So \"business\" is okay. But \"startup\" is the target. So maybe \"new business\" but that's too vague. What's another angle?\n\nStartups are often innovative, maybe \"innovative enterprise\"?
