	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt phantom\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - unreal\\ \tt - ghost\\ \tt - apparition\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "phantom," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words like "unreal," "ghost," or "apparition." Let me think about synonyms or related concepts. Phantom can mean something that's not real, like a ghost, but I can't use "ghost." Maybe "specter" or "shade," but wait, are those allowed? The related words are listed, so maybe those are off-limits too. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of characteristics. Phantom can be something that's elusive, hard to catch, or a feeling of something not being there. Like a "feeling of presence" without actual substance. Or maybe "a shadowy figure" but "shadow" isn't in the related words. Wait, the related words are unreal, ghost, apparition. So maybe "a fleeting image" or "something that isn't real but seems real." But need to be concise. Maybe "a non-physical presence" or "something that appears but isn't there." Or "a mirage" but that's more about visual illusions. Alternatively, "a phantom limb" is a term, but that's a specific medical term. Maybe "something that's not real but perceived." But need to make it short. How about "a ghostly illusion"? Wait, "ghostly" might be related to "ghost," which is a related word. Maybe "a deceptive image"
