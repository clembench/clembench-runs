Phantom can mean something that's not real, like a ghost, but I can't use \"ghost.\" Maybe \"specter\" or \"shade,\" but wait, are those allowed? The related words are listed, so maybe those are off-limits too. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of characteristics. Phantom can be something that's elusive, hard to catch, or a feeling of something not being there. Like a \"feeling of presence\" without actual substance. Or maybe \"a shadowy figure\" but \"shadow\" isn't in the related words. Wait, the related words are unreal, ghost, apparition. So maybe \"a fleeting image\" or \"something that isn't real but seems real.\" But need to be concise. Maybe \"a non-physical presence\" or \"something that appears but isn't there.\" Or \"a mirage\" but that's more about visual illusions. Alternatively, \"a phantom limb\" is a term, but that's a specific medical term. Maybe \"something that's not real but perceived.\" But need to make it short. How about \"a ghostly illusion\"? Wait, \"ghostly\" might be related to \"ghost,\" which is a related word. Maybe \"a deceptive image\"",
