	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt sacrifice\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - loss\\ \tt - victim\\ \tt - offering\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "sacrifice," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: loss, victim, offering. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does sacrifice mean? It's when you give up something important for a greater good. Maybe words like "giving up," "trade-off," "cost." But I have to be careful not to use the related words. "Loss" is a related word, so I can't say that. "Victim" is also related, so avoid that. "Offering" is another one, so no.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe focus on the action of giving up. Words like "renounce," "forfeit," "surrender." Or maybe the purpose, like "to achieve a higher purpose," "at the expense of," "compromise." Or think of examples, like a martyr, but "martyr" isn't a related word here. Wait, the related words are loss, victim, offering. So martyr might be okay. But maybe not. Let me check.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. "Sacrifice" can be "offering," but that's a related word. So can't use that. Maybe "giving up something valuable." But "valuable" is too vague. Or "a significant loss for a cause." Wait, "loss" is a related word. So I can't use that. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the act
