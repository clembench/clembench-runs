Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does sacrifice mean? It's when you give up something important for a greater good. Maybe words like \"giving up,\" \"trade-off,\" \"cost.\" But I have to be careful not to use the related words. \"Loss\" is a related word, so I can't say that. \"Victim\" is also related, so avoid that. \"Offering\" is another one, so no.\n\nMaybe focus on the action of giving up. Words like \"renounce,\" \"forfeit,\" \"surrender.\" Or maybe the purpose, like \"to achieve a higher purpose,\" \"at the expense of,\" \"compromise.\" Or think of examples, like a martyr, but \"martyr\" isn't a related word here. Wait, the related words are loss, victim, offering. So martyr might be okay. But maybe not. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms. \"Sacrifice\" can be \"offering,\" but that's a related word. So can't use that. Maybe \"giving up something valuable.\" But \"valuable\" is too vague. Or \"a significant loss for a cause.\" Wait, \"loss\" is a related word. So I can't use that. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: the act",
