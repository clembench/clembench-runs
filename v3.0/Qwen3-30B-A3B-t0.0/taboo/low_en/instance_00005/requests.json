The target word is \"database,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: table, index, knowledge. Hmm. So, what's a database? It's a structured collection of data. But I can't say \"data\" directly? Wait, no, the related words are table, index, knowledge. So \"data\" isn't forbidden. Wait, the user said \"parts or morphological variants\" of the target word. So \"database\" can't be used, but \"data\" is okay? Maybe. Let me check the rules again. Rule (b) says: You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it. So \"database\" is out. Parts like \"data\" – is that considered a part? Maybe. But maybe not. Alternatively, maybe \"database\" is the target, and related words are table, index, knowledge. So I can't use those. So I need to think of synonyms or related concepts.\n\nSo, a database is a place where you store information. But \"information\" isn't a related word. Maybe \"repository\"? But is that too vague? Or \"collection\"? But \"collection\" is too general. Maybe \"structured storage system\"? But maybe that's too technical. Alternatively, think of what a database does: stores, organizes, retrieves data. But how to describe that without using the forbidden words. Maybe \"",
