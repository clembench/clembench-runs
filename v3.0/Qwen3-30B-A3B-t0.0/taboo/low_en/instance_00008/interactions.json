Let me think.\n\nFirst, what's a boolean? It's a data type that can be either true or false. But I can't use \"true\" or \"false\" directly. Wait, the related words include \"true,\" so I have to avoid that. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I can describe it as a value that has two possible states. But how to phrase that without using \"true\" or \"false\"? Maybe \"two-state\" or \"binary\" value. But \"binary\" might be too vague. Alternatively, think about its use in programming. Since programming is a related word, I can't mention that either. So I need to avoid any references to programming.\n\nAnother angle: in logic, boolean is related, but \"logic\" is a related word. So I can't use that either. So maybe focus on the concept of a yes/no or on/off state. But \"yes/no\" might be okay. Wait, but the user said not to use related words. Let me check the related words again: logic, true, programming. So \"yes/no\" isn't listed, so that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a logical value. But \"logical\" might be related to \"logic,\" which is a no. So maybe avoid that. How about \"a value that can",
