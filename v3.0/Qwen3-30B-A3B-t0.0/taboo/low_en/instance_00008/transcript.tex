	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "boolean," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words like logic, true, or programming. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what's a boolean? It's a data type that can be either true or false. But I can't use "true" or "false" directly. Wait, the related words include "true," so I have to avoid that. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe I can describe it as a value that has two possible states. But how to phrase that without using "true" or "false"? Maybe "two-state" or "binary" value. But "binary" might be too vague. Alternatively, think about its use in programming. Since programming is a related word, I can't mention that either. So I need to avoid any references to programming.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: in logic, boolean is related, but "logic" is a related word. So I can't use that either. So maybe focus on the concept of a yes/no or on/off state. But "yes/no" might be okay. Wait, but the user said not to use related words. Let me check the related words again: logic, true, programming. So "yes/no" isn't listed, so that's safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of it as a logical value. But "logical" might be related to "logic," which is a no. So maybe avoid that. How about "a value that can
