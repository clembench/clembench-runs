	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "berth," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: dock, port, position. Hmm. So, what's a berth? It's a place where a ship stops, right? But I can't say dock or port. Maybe think of synonyms. Like a spot or a place. But "position" is also a related word, so I can't use that either.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe focus on the function. A berth is where a vessel is moored. So maybe describe it as a designated area for ships. But "designated" might be too vague. Or maybe "a place where a ship stays while in a harbor." But I need to be concise. Let me think of other terms. Maybe "mooring spot" but is that too similar? Or "harbor space"? Not sure. Alternatively, think of the physical structure. Like a pier or a wharf, but those might be related to dock. Oh, but dock is a related word, so I can't use that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: berth can also mean a sleeping place on a ship, like a cabin. But the user might be thinking of the maritime meaning. The question didn't specify, but since the related words include dock, port, position, probably the maritime one. So maybe "a place where a ship is secured in a harbor." But "secured" might be okay.
