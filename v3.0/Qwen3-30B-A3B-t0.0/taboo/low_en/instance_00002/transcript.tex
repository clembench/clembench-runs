	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt competent\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - efficient\\ \tt - skilled\\ \tt - capable\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "competent," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: efficient, skilled, capable. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does competent mean? It means having the ability to do something well. So maybe focus on ability or effectiveness. But I can't use "skilled" or "capable." Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternative synonyms: proficient, able, qualified, competent. But "competent" is the target, so I can't use that. Maybe "adept"? Wait, is adept a related word? The related words given are efficient, skilled, capable. So maybe "adept" is okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Or think about the characteristics. Competent people are reliable, can handle tasks, knowledgeable. Maybe "knows how to do things effectively" but that's a bit long. Need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "good at what they do" but "good" is too vague. Maybe "effective" but is that allowed? The related words don't include effective, so maybe. But the user said not to use related words. Wait, the related words are efficient, skilled, capable. So "effective" isn't in that list. So maybe "effective" is okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user said to avoid the target word and related words. So "effective" is allowed. But maybe the other player might not get it. Alternatively, "proficient" is another synonym. But is that
