Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does competent mean? It means having the ability to do something well. So maybe focus on ability or effectiveness. But I can't use \"skilled\" or \"capable.\" Hmm.\n\nAlternative synonyms: proficient, able, qualified, competent. But \"competent\" is the target, so I can't use that. Maybe \"adept\"? Wait, is adept a related word? The related words given are efficient, skilled, capable. So maybe \"adept\" is okay.\n\nOr think about the characteristics. Competent people are reliable, can handle tasks, knowledgeable. Maybe \"knows how to do things effectively\" but that's a bit long. Need to be concise.\n\nAnother angle: \"good at what they do\" but \"good\" is too vague. Maybe \"effective\" but is that allowed? The related words don't include effective, so maybe. But the user said not to use related words. Wait, the related words are efficient, skilled, capable. So \"effective\" isn't in that list. So maybe \"effective\" is okay.\n\nBut the user said to avoid the target word and related words. So \"effective\" is allowed. But maybe the other player might not get it. Alternatively, \"proficient\" is another synonym. But is that",
