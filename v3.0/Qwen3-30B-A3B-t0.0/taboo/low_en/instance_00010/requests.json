Let me think about what troubleshooting involves. It's about identifying and resolving problems. So maybe words like \"problem-solving\" or \"identify issues.\" But I have to be concise. Maybe \"Identify and resolve issues\" but wait, \"resolve\" might be too close to \"fix.\" Hmm. Alternatively, \"Diagnose and fix problems\" but \"diagnose\" is a related word. Oh, right, the related words are fix, debug, diagnose. So I can't use those. So I need another approach. Maybe \"Address technical issues\" or \"Resolve technical problems.\" But \"resolve\" could be linked to fix. Alternatively, \"Find solutions to problems.\" But that's too vague. What's another angle? Troubleshooting is often done when something isn't working. So \"Investigate and correct malfunctions.\" \"Malfunctions\" is a good term. Or \"Debugging process\" but \"debugging\" is related to debug. Wait, the related words are fix, debug, diagnose. So \"debugging\" is a variant of debug, so that's not allowed. So maybe \"Investigate and correct technical issues.\" That might work. Or \"Systematic problem-solving.\" But I need to make sure it's clear. Let me check the rules again. No using",
