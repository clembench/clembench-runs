	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "wicket," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: lattice, gate, door. Let me think about what a wicket is. A wicket is a small gate, often used in cricket, right? But I can't say "gate" because that's a related word. So I need another way to describe it.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe focus on its structure. A wicket is typically a small opening in a fence or a barrier, maybe with a latch. But "latch" isn't a related word, so that's okay. Or think about its function: it's used to allow passage through a fence. But how to describe that without using "gate" or "door"?\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: in cricket, a wicket is the set of three stumps and two bails. But the user might be thinking of the gate version. Maybe mention it's a small entrance. Wait, "entrance" isn't a related word. Or "opening" in a fence. But maybe too vague.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. Maybe "small gate" but "gate" is forbidden. So rephrase: "a movable barrier for passage through a fence." But "barrier" is okay. Or "a hinged structure for crossing a fence." Hmm. Or "a small door-like structure." But "door" is related. So avoid that.\\ \tt \\ \tt What about the shape? A wicket
