Let me think about what a wicket is. A wicket is a small gate, often used in cricket, right? But I can't say \"gate\" because that's a related word. So I need another way to describe it.\n\nMaybe focus on its structure. A wicket is typically a small opening in a fence or a barrier, maybe with a latch. But \"latch\" isn't a related word, so that's okay. Or think about its function: it's used to allow passage through a fence. But how to describe that without using \"gate\" or \"door\"?\n\nAnother angle: in cricket, a wicket is the set of three stumps and two bails. But the user might be thinking of the gate version. Maybe mention it's a small entrance. Wait, \"entrance\" isn't a related word. Or \"opening\" in a fence. But maybe too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms. Maybe \"small gate\" but \"gate\" is forbidden. So rephrase: \"a movable barrier for passage through a fence.\" But \"barrier\" is okay. Or \"a hinged structure for crossing a fence.\" Hmm. Or \"a small door-like structure.\" But \"door\" is related. So avoid that.\n\nWhat about the shape? A wicket",
