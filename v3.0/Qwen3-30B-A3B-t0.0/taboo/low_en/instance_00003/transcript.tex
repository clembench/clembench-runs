	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt steady\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - constant\\ \tt - firm\\ \tt - even\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "steady," and I need to describe it without using "steady" or its related words like "constant," "firm," or "even." Let me think about synonyms or related concepts. "Steady" can mean not moving, so maybe "unmoving" or "still." But wait, "still" might be too similar. What about "stable"? No, "stable" is a bit different. Maybe "consistent"? But "constant" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about "balanced"? Or "unwavering"? Wait, "unwavering" might be okay. Let me check the rules again. The related words are constant, firm, even. So "unwavering" isn't listed, so that's safe. Alternatively, "solid" but that's more about strength. Maybe "fixed"? But "fixed" could be related. Hmm. Another angle: "steady" as in not shaking, so "stable" in movement. Or "calm"? No, that's more about emotion. Maybe "regular"? But "regular" is different. Wait, the user said to be concise. Let me pick "unwavering" as a clue. That should work without using any forbidden words.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: Unwavering in position or movement.
