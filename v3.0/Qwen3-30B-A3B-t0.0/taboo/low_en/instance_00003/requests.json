What about \"stable\"? No, \"stable\" is a bit different. Maybe \"consistent\"? But \"constant\" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about \"balanced\"? Or \"unwavering\"? Wait, \"unwavering\" might be okay. Let me check the rules again. The related words are constant, firm, even. So \"unwavering\" isn't listed, so that's safe. Alternatively, \"solid\" but that's more about strength. Maybe \"fixed\"? But \"fixed\" could be related. Hmm. Another angle: \"steady\" as in not shaking, so \"stable\" in movement. Or \"calm\"? No, that's more about emotion. Maybe \"regular\"? But \"regular\" is different. Wait, the user said to be concise. Let me pick \"unwavering\" as a clue. That should work without using any forbidden words.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: Unwavering in position or movement.<|im_end|>",
