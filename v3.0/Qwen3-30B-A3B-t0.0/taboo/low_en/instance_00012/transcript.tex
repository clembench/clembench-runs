	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "stakeholder," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: partner, share, concerned. Hmm. So, what's a stakeholder? They're people or groups with an interest in a company's success. But I can't say "partner" or "share" or "concerned." Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Stakeholder is someone who has a stake in something, like a business. So maybe "individual with a vested interest" but "vested" might be too technical. Or "party with a financial interest"? Wait, "financial" isn't in the related words. Or "investor"? But investor is similar to shareholder, which is related to "share." Oh, but "share" is a related word, so I can't use that. So maybe "person involved in a company's outcomes" but "involved" is too vague. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the role: someone who is affected by or can affect the company's decisions. But how to phrase that without the forbidden words. Maybe "individual with a stake in a business's success" but "stake" is part of the target word. Wait, the rules say not to use the target word or related words. "Stake" isn't listed as a related word, so maybe that's okay. Let me check the related words again: partner, share
