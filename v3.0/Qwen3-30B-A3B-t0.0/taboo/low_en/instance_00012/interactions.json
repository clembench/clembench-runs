So, what's a stakeholder? They're people or groups with an interest in a company's success. But I can't say \"partner\" or \"share\" or \"concerned.\" Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts.\n\nStakeholder is someone who has a stake in something, like a business. So maybe \"individual with a vested interest\" but \"vested\" might be too technical. Or \"party with a financial interest\"? Wait, \"financial\" isn't in the related words. Or \"investor\"? But investor is similar to shareholder, which is related to \"share.\" Oh, but \"share\" is a related word, so I can't use that. So maybe \"person involved in a company's outcomes\" but \"involved\" is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, think of the role: someone who is affected by or can affect the company's decisions. But how to phrase that without the forbidden words. Maybe \"individual with a stake in a business's success\" but \"stake\" is part of the target word. Wait, the rules say not to use the target word or related words. \"Stake\" isn't listed as a related word, so maybe that's okay. Let me check the related words again: partner, share",
