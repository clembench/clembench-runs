	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "notable," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: important, outstanding, prominent. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Notable means something that is worth noting, famous, or significant. But I can't use the related words. So maybe think of other ways to express that. Words like "well-known," "famous," "distinguished," "remarkable," "striking," or "noticeable." Wait, but I have to make sure none of those are related. Let me check the related words again. The user said the related words are important, outstanding, prominent. So "remarkable" might be okay. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of examples. Like "someone who is known for their achievements" or "something that stands out." But need to be concise. Maybe "worthy of attention" or "distinguished." Or "having a reputation." \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said to give short descriptions. So maybe "worthy of attention" or "distinguished." Let me check if those are okay. "Distinguished" is a synonym but not one of the related words. "Worthy of attention" is a phrase that conveys the meaning without using the forbidden words. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: think of antonyms. Notable is the opposite of obscure or unknown. But that might not help. Maybe "famous" but that's too close. Wait, the related
