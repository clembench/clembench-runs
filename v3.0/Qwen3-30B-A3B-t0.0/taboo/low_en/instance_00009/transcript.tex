	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "widow," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: woman, husband, dead. Hmm. So, a widow is a woman whose husband has died. But I can't mention "woman" or "husband" or "dead." How can I rephrase that?\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe focus on the state of being without a spouse. Like, someone who has lost their partner. But "partner" might be too vague. Or "spouse" is another term, but is that allowed? Wait, the related words are woman, husband, dead. So "spouse" isn't listed, so maybe that's okay. But the user said not to use parts or morphological variants. "Spouse" isn't a variant of "widow," so maybe that's safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the emotional aspect. A person who is mourning. But "mourning" might be related to "dead," which is a forbidden word. Maybe not. Or "bereaved." But is "bereaved" a related word? The given related words are woman, husband, dead. So maybe "bereaved" is okay. But the user might consider it related. Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the title given to a woman after her husband's death. But again, "husband" is a related word. So I can't use that. Maybe "a woman who has lost
