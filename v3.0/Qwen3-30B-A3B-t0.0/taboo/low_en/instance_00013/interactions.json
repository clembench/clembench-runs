Let's think.\n\nFirst, what's wheat? It's a type of plant, right? But I can't say \"grain\" or \"grass.\" Maybe focus on its uses. Wheat is used to make flour, but I can't mention flour either. So maybe talk about its role in food. Like, it's a staple crop. But \"staple\" might be okay. Or maybe describe its characteristics. Wheat is a cereal plant, but \"cereal\" isn't in the related words. Wait, the related words are grain, grass, flour. So \"cereal\" is safe?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parts of the plant. The seeds are used for food. But again, avoiding the related words. Maybe mention that it's a plant grown for its seeds. But \"plant\" is too general. Or think about where it's grownâ€”fields, maybe? But that's too vague.\n\nAnother angle: wheat is a type of grass, but \"grass\" is a related word. So I can't say that. So maybe avoid that. What about the texture or appearance? Wheat has stalks and grains. But \"grain\" is related. Hmm. Maybe describe it as a hardy plant that's cultivated for its seeds. Or mention that it's a major crop worldwide",
