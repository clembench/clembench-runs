	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt guard\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - security\\ \tt - protect\\ \tt - defend\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "guard," and the related words are security, protect, defend. I need to describe "guard" without using those words. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does "guard" mean? It can be a noun, like a person who watches over something, or a verb, meaning to protect. Since the related words are security, protect, defend, I need to avoid those. So I can't say "protect" or "defend." \\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe focus on the role of a guard. They keep watch, ensure safety. But "security" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe use synonyms like "watch," "monitor," "safeguard." Wait, "safeguard" is similar to protect, which is related. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of examples. A guard at a door, a guard dog, a guard in a prison. But maybe that's too specific. The other player needs to guess "guard," so the clue should be general enough.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the action of guarding. Words like "watch over," "stand by," "keep an eye on." But need to be concise. Maybe "Keep an eye on something" but that's a bit vague. \\ \tt \\ \tt Or think of the purpose: to prevent harm. But "prevent" isn't a related word. Maybe "Ensure safety without using the forbidden terms." \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said to give short descriptions. So maybe
