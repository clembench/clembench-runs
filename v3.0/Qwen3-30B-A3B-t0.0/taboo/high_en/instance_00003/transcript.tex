	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt finance\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - resources\\ \tt - money\\ \tt - fund\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "finance," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words like resources, money, or fund. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Finance is about managing money, but I can't say money. Maybe "financial management" but that's too long. What's another term? Maybe "funds" but that's a related word. Wait, the related words are resources, money, fund. So I can't use those. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternative approaches: Think of industries or areas related to finance. Like banking, investments, or economics. But maybe too broad. Or terms like "capital," but is that allowed? The related words don't include capital, so maybe that's okay. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: Activities involved in finance, like budgeting, investing, or fiscal management. But need to be concise. \\ \tt \\ \tt What's a short term that's not in the related words? "Capital" might work. Or "funds" is a related word, so no. How about "monetary affairs"? But "monetary" relates to money, which is a related word. Maybe "financial systems"? Not sure. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said to be concise. Maybe "budgeting" or "investing" but those are specific aspects. The other player might not get it. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the purpose of finance: managing financial resources. But "resources" is a related word. Hmm
