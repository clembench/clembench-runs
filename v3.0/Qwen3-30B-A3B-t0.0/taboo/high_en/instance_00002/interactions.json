Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"band\" can mean a group of musicians, but since \"group\" is a related word, I can't use that. Maybe \"collection\" or \"ensemble\"? Wait, \"ensemble\" might be okay. Or \"team\"? But \"team\" isn't in the related words. Wait, the related words are music, loop, group. So I can't use \"group\" directly. \n\nAnother meaning of \"band\" is a loop, like a rubber band. But \"loop\" is a related word. So I can't use that either. So maybe describe it as a circular object used to hold things together? But the user might think of a rubber band. But the target word is \"band,\" so maybe the other player knows it's a group. Wait, but the related words include \"music,\" so maybe the target is the musical group. But I can't say \"group\" or \"music.\" \n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms. For a musical group, maybe \"ensemble\" or \"group,\" but \"group\" is forbidden. So \"ensemble\" might work. Or \"musical group,\" but \"music\" is a related word. Hmm. \n\nWait, the rules say not to use the target word or related words. So \"music,\" \"loop",
