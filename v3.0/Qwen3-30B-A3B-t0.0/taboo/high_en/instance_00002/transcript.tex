	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "band," and the related words are music, loop, group. I need to describe "band" without using those words. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "band" can mean a group of musicians, but since "group" is a related word, I can't use that. Maybe "collection" or "ensemble"? Wait, "ensemble" might be okay. Or "team"? But "team" isn't in the related words. Wait, the related words are music, loop, group. So I can't use "group" directly. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another meaning of "band" is a loop, like a rubber band. But "loop" is a related word. So I can't use that either. So maybe describe it as a circular object used to hold things together? But the user might think of a rubber band. But the target word is "band," so maybe the other player knows it's a group. Wait, but the related words include "music," so maybe the target is the musical group. But I can't say "group" or "music." \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. For a musical group, maybe "ensemble" or "group," but "group" is forbidden. So "ensemble" might work. Or "musical group," but "music" is a related word. Hmm. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the rules say not to use the target word or related words. So "music," "loop
