Western is a genre, so maybe talk about the setting. It's often associated with the American Old West. So terms like \"frontier,\" \"ranch,\" \"desert,\" \"cowboys\" but wait, cowboy is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe \"cowboy\" is off-limits. So alternatives: \"outlaws,\" \"sheriff,\" \"gunfights,\" \"saddle,\" \"horseback.\" But need to be concise. Maybe \"genre set in the American frontier with themes of lawlessness and adventure.\" But need to make it shorter. \"Set in the American frontier, featuring lawmen and outlaws.\" Wait, \"lawmen\" might be okay. Or \"genre involving frontier life and conflict.\" Hmm. Alternatively, think of synonyms for western. Like \"frontier\" or \"old west.\" But need to avoid related words. Maybe \"type of film or story from the 19th-century American West.\" But \"film\" is related? The related words are eastern, cowboy, movie. So \"movie\" is a related word. So can't use \"movie.\" So maybe \"genre involving tales of the American frontier.\" That's better. Or \"stories set in the 19th-century western United States.\" But need",
