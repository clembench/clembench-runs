	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt away\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - gone\\ \tt - distance\\ \tt - here\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "away," and the related words are "gone," "distance," and "here." I need to describe "away" without using those words. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "away" means not here, so maybe opposite of "here." But "here" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What's another way to say not here? Maybe "not present" or "removed." But "removed" might be too vague.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "away" can mean a distance. But "distance" is a related word. So I can't use that either. Maybe "far from" but that's similar to distance. Wait, the user said not to use related words. So "distance" is out. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about synonyms for "away"? Like "off," "out," "elsewhere." But "elsewhere" might be okay. Or "not near." But "near" is not a related word. Let me check the rules again. The related words are gone, distance, here. So "near" is allowed. \\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe "not near" or "far from." But "far" is a bit simple. Alternatively, "separated" or "removed." Or "in a different place." But need to be concise. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user wants short descriptions. So maybe "not here" but "here" is a related word. Oh, right,
