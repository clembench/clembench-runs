Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"away\" means not here, so maybe opposite of \"here.\" But \"here\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What's another way to say not here? Maybe \"not present\" or \"removed.\" But \"removed\" might be too vague.\n\nAnother angle: \"away\" can mean a distance. But \"distance\" is a related word. So I can't use that either. Maybe \"far from\" but that's similar to distance. Wait, the user said not to use related words. So \"distance\" is out. \n\nWhat about synonyms for \"away\"? Like \"off,\" \"out,\" \"elsewhere.\" But \"elsewhere\" might be okay. Or \"not near.\" But \"near\" is not a related word. Let me check the rules again. The related words are gone, distance, here. So \"near\" is allowed. \n\nSo maybe \"not near\" or \"far from.\" But \"far\" is a bit simple. Alternatively, \"separated\" or \"removed.\" Or \"in a different place.\" But need to be concise. \n\nWait, the user wants short descriptions. So maybe \"not here\" but \"here\" is a related word. Oh, right,",
