The other player has three guesses, so I need to be concise.\n\nFirst, think about what tea is. It's a beverage, usually made from leaves. But I can't say \"brew\" because that's a related word. Maybe focus on the ingredients. Tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant. But that might be too specific. Alternatively, think of common associations. Tea is often served in cups, maybe with a mug. But \"mug\" isn't a related word here. Wait, the related words are coffee, caffeine, brew. So \"mug\" is okay.\n\nAnother angle: tea is a popular drink worldwide. It's different from coffee. Maybe mention it's a non-caffeinated alternative? But caffeine is a related word. Hmm, can't use that. Maybe \"stimulant\" but that's related to caffeine. Not sure. Alternatively, think of types of tea like green, black, but those are specific. Maybe \"infusion\" but that's similar to brew. Wait, \"brew\" is a related word, so I can't use that. \n\nWhat about the process? Tea is made by steeping leaves in hot water. But \"steeping\" might be too technical. Maybe \"hot drink made from leaves.\" But \"le",
