A field is an open area of land, but I can't say \"area.\" Maybe talk about its use. Like a place where crops are grown? But \"farm\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe mention sports? Like a soccer field, but again, \"field\" is the target. Hmm. What's another aspect? Maybe \"open space\" but \"area\" is forbidden. How about \"a large outdoor space used for activities\"? Wait, \"space\" might be okay. Or \"a piece of land used for farming or sports.\" But \"farming\" relates to \"farm,\" which is a related word. Maybe avoid that. Think of synonyms: \"domain,\" but that's more abstract. \"Terrain\"? Not exactly. \"Plot\" of land? But \"plot\" could be related. Alternatively, \"a stretch of land\" but \"land\" is too general. Maybe focus on the physical aspects: \"a flat expanse of land\" but \"expanse\" might be okay. Or \"an area without many trees\" but \"area\" is forbidden. Wait, the related words are farm, grass, area. So \"area\" is out. Let me try: \"A large open space used for growing crops or sports.\" But \"crops",
