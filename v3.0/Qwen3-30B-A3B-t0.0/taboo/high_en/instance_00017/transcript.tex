	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt pricing\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - evaluation\\ \tt - cost\\ \tt - value\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "pricing," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: evaluation, cost, value. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does pricing mean? It's about setting the price of a product or service. So maybe focus on the process of determining prices. But I can't say "cost" or "value." Maybe terms like "determining price," "setting rates," or "price strategy." Wait, "rates" might be okay. Or "how much something is worth financially." But "worth" could relate to value, which is a related word. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the factors involved in pricing. Like market demand, competition, production expenses. But I need to keep it short. Maybe "determining the monetary amount for a product" – but "monetary" is a bit long. Or "setting the price tag." But "price tag" is specific. Maybe "the process of establishing prices." That's concise. Let me check if any of the related words are there. Evaluation, cost, value – no, that's okay. So CLUE: The process of establishing prices. That should work. Let me make sure I didn't use any forbidden words. No, looks good. Short and to the point.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: The process of establishing prices.
