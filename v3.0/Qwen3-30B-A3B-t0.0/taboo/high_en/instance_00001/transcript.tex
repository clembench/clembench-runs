	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt respect\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - consideration\\ \tt - deference\\ \tt - regard\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "respect," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: consideration, deference, regard. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Respect can mean admiration, esteem, or high regard. But I can't use "regard" or "consideration." Maybe "admiration" is a good alternative. Or "esteem." Wait, but I need to make sure those aren't in the related words. The related words are consideration, deference, regard. So "admiration" and "esteem" are safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: actions that show respect, like treating someone politely. But the target is the noun. Maybe "high regard" but "regard" is a related word. So I can't use that. How about "acknowledgment"? Or "recognition"?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of phrases. "Show respect" could be "treat someone with admiration." But the clue needs to be a single word or a short phrase. Maybe "admiration" is the best bet. Let me check if that's allowed. Since "admiration" isn't in the related words, it's okay. So the clue could be "admiration." But maybe the player might not get it. Alternatively, "esteem" is another option. Or "honor." Wait, "honor" is a synonym but not sure. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe "courtesy"
