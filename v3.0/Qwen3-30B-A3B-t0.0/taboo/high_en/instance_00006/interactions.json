Maybe \"range\" is a possibility, but I should check if that's allowed. Wait, the related words are given, so \"range\" isn't listed, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, \"scope\" or \"extent.\" But I need to be concise.\n\nAnother angle: actions related to reach. Like \"touch,\" but that's too simple. Or \"access,\" but maybe that's too vague. What about \"the ability to touch something\"? But that's a bit long. Maybe \"ability to touch\" but need to make it shorter.\n\nWait, the user said to be concise. Let me think of a single word. \"Range\" might work. Let me check if \"range\" is a related word. The related words are stretch, extend, distance. So \"range\" isn't listed, so it's allowed. So CLUE: Range. That's short and to the point. Let me confirm if that's acceptable. The target word is \"reach,\" and \"range\" is a synonym. The other player might guess it. Alternatively, \"scope\" but \"scope\" is also a possible clue. But \"range\" is more directly related.",
