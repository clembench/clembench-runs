	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt reach\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - stretch\\ \tt - extend\\ \tt - distance\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "reach," and I need to describe it without using "reach" or its related words like "stretch," "extend," or "distance." Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt "Reach" can mean the area where something can be touched or affected. Maybe "range" is a possibility, but I should check if that's allowed. Wait, the related words are given, so "range" isn't listed, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, "scope" or "extent." But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: actions related to reach. Like "touch," but that's too simple. Or "access," but maybe that's too vague. What about "the ability to touch something"? But that's a bit long. Maybe "ability to touch" but need to make it shorter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said to be concise. Let me think of a single word. "Range" might work. Let me check if "range" is a related word. The related words are stretch, extend, distance. So "range" isn't listed, so it's allowed. So CLUE: Range. That's short and to the point. Let me confirm if that's acceptable. The target word is "reach," and "range" is a synonym. The other player might guess it. Alternatively, "scope" but "scope" is also a possible clue. But "range" is more directly related.
