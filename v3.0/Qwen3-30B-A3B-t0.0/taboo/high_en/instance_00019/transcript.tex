	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt late\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - slow\\ \tt - delay\\ \tt - early\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "late," and the related words are "slow," "delay," and "early." I need to describe "late" without using those words or their variants. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "late" can mean not on time, after the expected moment. So maybe focus on the opposite of "early." But "early" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What's another way to phrase it? Maybe "after the scheduled time" but that's a bit long. Or "not punctual." Wait, "punctual" is related to being on time, so maybe that's okay. But the user said to avoid morphological variants. "Punctual" isn't a variant of "late," so maybe that's safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. Words like "tardy," "belated," "postponed." But "delay" is a related word, so "postponed" might be okay. Wait, "delay" is in the related words, but "postponed" isn't. So maybe "later than scheduled" or "after the deadline." But need to keep it short.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "late" as in the time of day, like "late evening." But the target word is "late" as an adjective, not a time of day. So maybe that's not the right direction.\\ \tt \\ \tt What about "not early"? But "early
