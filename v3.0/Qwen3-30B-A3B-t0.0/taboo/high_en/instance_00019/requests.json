Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"late\" can mean not on time, after the expected moment. So maybe focus on the opposite of \"early.\" But \"early\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What's another way to phrase it? Maybe \"after the scheduled time\" but that's a bit long. Or \"not punctual.\" Wait, \"punctual\" is related to being on time, so maybe that's okay. But the user said to avoid morphological variants. \"Punctual\" isn't a variant of \"late,\" so maybe that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms. Words like \"tardy,\" \"belated,\" \"postponed.\" But \"delay\" is a related word, so \"postponed\" might be okay. Wait, \"delay\" is in the related words, but \"postponed\" isn't. So maybe \"later than scheduled\" or \"after the deadline.\" But need to keep it short.\n\nAnother angle: \"late\" as in the time of day, like \"late evening.\" But the target word is \"late\" as an adjective, not a time of day. So maybe that's not the right direction.\n\nWhat about \"not early\"? But \"early",
