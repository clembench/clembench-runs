	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt must\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - should\\ \tt - essential\\ \tt - have\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "must," and the related words are "should," "essential," and "have." I need to describe "must" without using those words. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt "Must" can mean a necessity or a strong obligation. So maybe words like "requirement" or "necessity." But I have to be careful not to use "essential" which is a related word. Alternatively, "obligation" or "duty." Wait, but the user said to keep it short. Maybe "required" or "needed." But "have" is also a related word. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "must" as in "You must do this" â€“ it's a strong recommendation. So maybe "strongly advised" but "should" is related. Maybe "compulsory" or "mandatory." But are those allowed? The rules say not to use the target word or related words. "Mandatory" isn't listed as a related word, so that's okay. Or "required." Let me check the related words again: should, essential, have. So "required" is safe. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the verb form. "Must" is a modal verb. But maybe that's too technical. The other player might not get it. Need something more straightforward. \\ \tt \\ \tt How about "necessity"? But "essential" is related, but "necessity" isn't.
