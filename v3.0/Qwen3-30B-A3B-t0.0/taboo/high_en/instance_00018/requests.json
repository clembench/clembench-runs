Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\n\n\"Must\" can mean a necessity or a strong obligation. So maybe words like \"requirement\" or \"necessity.\" But I have to be careful not to use \"essential\" which is a related word. Alternatively, \"obligation\" or \"duty.\" Wait, but the user said to keep it short. Maybe \"required\" or \"needed.\" But \"have\" is also a related word. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: \"must\" as in \"You must do this\" – it's a strong recommendation. So maybe \"strongly advised\" but \"should\" is related. Maybe \"compulsory\" or \"mandatory.\" But are those allowed? The rules say not to use the target word or related words. \"Mandatory\" isn't listed as a related word, so that's okay. Or \"required.\" Let me check the related words again: should, essential, have. So \"required\" is safe. \n\nAlternatively, think of the verb form. \"Must\" is a modal verb. But maybe that's too technical. The other player might not get it. Need something more straightforward. \n\nHow about \"necessity\"? But \"essential\" is related, but \"necessity\" isn't.",
