Let's think.\n\nFirst, \"least\" is the superlative of \"little,\" but I can't use \"little\" directly. Maybe focus on the concept of the smallest amount. But \"amount\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. Hmm.\n\nWhat's another way to phrase it? Maybe \"smallest in degree\" or \"minimum.\" Wait, \"minimum\" might be okay. Or \"the least of all.\" But \"all\" might not be helpful. Alternatively, think about opposites. The opposite of \"most\" is \"least,\" but \"most\" is a related word, so I can't mention that. \n\nMaybe use synonyms for \"least\" like \"smallest,\" \"minimum,\" \"fewest,\" but need to check if those are allowed. The rules say not to use the target word or related words. \"Fewest\" isn't listed, so maybe that's safe. Or \"lowest\" in some contexts. \n\nWait, the user said to give short descriptions. So maybe \"smallest in quantity\" or \"minimum amount.\" But \"amount\" is a related word. Oh, right, so I can't use \"amount.\" So maybe \"smallest quantity\" or \"least in size.\" But \"size",
