	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt least\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - amount\\ \tt - most\\ \tt - little\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "least," and the related words are "amount," "most," and "little." I need to describe "least" without using those words or their variants. Let's think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "least" is the superlative of "little," but I can't use "little" directly. Maybe focus on the concept of the smallest amount. But "amount" is a related word, so I can't use that either. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt What's another way to phrase it? Maybe "smallest in degree" or "minimum." Wait, "minimum" might be okay. Or "the least of all." But "all" might not be helpful. Alternatively, think about opposites. The opposite of "most" is "least," but "most" is a related word, so I can't mention that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe use synonyms for "least" like "smallest," "minimum," "fewest," but need to check if those are allowed. The rules say not to use the target word or related words. "Fewest" isn't listed, so maybe that's safe. Or "lowest" in some contexts. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said to give short descriptions. So maybe "smallest in quantity" or "minimum amount." But "amount" is a related word. Oh, right, so I can't use "amount." So maybe "smallest quantity" or "least in size." But "size
