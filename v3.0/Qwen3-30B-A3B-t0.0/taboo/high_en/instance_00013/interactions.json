Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\n\nMarine relates to the sea or ocean. So maybe words like \"seawater,\" \"oceanic,\" or \"marine life.\" Wait, but \"marine life\" is related. Hmm. What about \"saltwater\"? That's a good one. Or \"related to the sea.\" But I need to be concise. Maybe \"pertaining to the sea\" but that's a bit long. Alternatively, \"oceanic\" but is that allowed? The related words are aquatic, nautical, oceangoing. So oceanic might be okay. Wait, the user said not to use related words. Let me check the list again: the related words are aquatic, nautical, oceangoing. So \"oceanic\" isn't on the list. Maybe that's safe. But maybe the other player could guess it. Alternatively, \"saltwater\" is a good clue. Or \"seafaring.\" Wait, seafaring is more about sailing. Maybe \"relating to the sea\" but that's too vague. Let me think of another angle. Marine can also mean a type of soldier, like a Marine Corps. But the other player might not know that. But the context here is probably the sea. So",
