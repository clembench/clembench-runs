	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt protect\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - guard\\ \tt - safe\\ \tt - defend\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "protect," and I can't use it or the related words like "guard," "safe," or "defend." Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. Words like shield, safeguard, defend, but wait, "defend" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe "shield" is okay? Or "keep safe"? But "safe" is also a related word. Hmm. How about "guard against harm"? But "guard" is related. Maybe "prevent harm" or "ensure safety." Wait, "safe" is related, so "ensure safety" might be tricky. Alternatively, "protect" is to keep from harm, so maybe "keep from damage" or "secure." But "secure" could be a possible clue. Let me check if "secure" is allowed. The related words are guard, safe, defend. So "secure" isn't listed, so maybe that's okay. Or "safeguard" but that's similar to "safe." Maybe "shield" is better. Let me go with "Shield from harm." But need to make sure it's not using any related words. "Shield" isn't in the list, so that's okay. Alternatively, "Keep safe" but "safe" is related. So maybe "Prevent harm" or "Guard against danger." Wait, "guard" is related. So avoid that. Maybe "Ensure safety"
