How about \"guard against harm\"? But \"guard\" is related. Maybe \"prevent harm\" or \"ensure safety.\" Wait, \"safe\" is related, so \"ensure safety\" might be tricky. Alternatively, \"protect\" is to keep from harm, so maybe \"keep from damage\" or \"secure.\" But \"secure\" could be a possible clue. Let me check if \"secure\" is allowed. The related words are guard, safe, defend. So \"secure\" isn't listed, so maybe that's okay. Or \"safeguard\" but that's similar to \"safe.\" Maybe \"shield\" is better. Let me go with \"Shield from harm.\" But need to make sure it's not using any related words. \"Shield\" isn't in the list, so that's okay. Alternatively, \"Keep safe\" but \"safe\" is related. So maybe \"Prevent harm\" or \"Guard against danger.\" Wait, \"guard\" is related. So avoid that. Maybe \"Ensure safety\"",
