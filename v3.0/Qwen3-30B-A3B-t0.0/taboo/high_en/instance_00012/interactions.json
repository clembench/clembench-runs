Let me think.\n\nFirst, what's a wing? It's a part of a bird, but I can't say bird. Maybe think about its function. Wings help in flying. But \"fly\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What else? Wings are appendages. Maybe describe their structure. They have feathers, but \"feather\" is a related word. So I can't mention that either.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of synonyms or related concepts. Like \"appendage,\" \"limb,\" but maybe too vague. Or think about movement. Wings are used for movement in air. But again, \"fly\" is off-limits. Maybe \"part used for aerial movement\"? But that's a bit long. Or \"structure that enables flight,\" but \"flight\" might be related? Wait, the related words are feather, fly, bird. So \"flight\" isn't listed, maybe it's okay. But the user said not to use related words. Let me check the rules again. The related words are feather, fly, bird. So \"flight\" isn't there. So maybe \"structure that enables flight\" is safe. But maybe too indirect. The other player might not get it. Alternatively, think of parts of an airplane? Like \"airplane part\"",
