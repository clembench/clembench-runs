	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt wing\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - feather\\ \tt - fly\\ \tt - bird\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "wing," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: feather, fly, bird. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what's a wing? It's a part of a bird, but I can't say bird. Maybe think about its function. Wings help in flying. But "fly" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm. What else? Wings are appendages. Maybe describe their structure. They have feathers, but "feather" is a related word. So I can't mention that either.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternative approach: Think of synonyms or related concepts. Like "appendage," "limb," but maybe too vague. Or think about movement. Wings are used for movement in air. But again, "fly" is off-limits. Maybe "part used for aerial movement"? But that's a bit long. Or "structure that enables flight," but "flight" might be related? Wait, the related words are feather, fly, bird. So "flight" isn't listed, maybe it's okay. But the user said not to use related words. Let me check the rules again. The related words are feather, fly, bird. So "flight" isn't there. So maybe "structure that enables flight" is safe. But maybe too indirect. The other player might not get it. Alternatively, think of parts of an airplane? Like "airplane part"
