The target word is \"woman,\" and the related words are \"female,\" \"girl,\" and \"lady.\" I need to describe \"woman\" without using any of those related words or the target itself. The user wants short, to-the-point clues.\n\nFirst, think about synonyms or related concepts. But I can't use \"female,\" \"girl,\" or \"lady.\" So maybe focus on characteristics. A woman is an adult female human. But \"female\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe describe her as an adult woman, but \"woman\" is the target. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approaches: Think about roles or attributes. Like \"adult human female,\" but again, \"female\" is off-limits. Maybe use \"adult female human being,\" but that's a bit long. Wait, the user said short descriptions. Maybe \"adult human\" but that's too vague. Or \"female adult,\" but \"female\" is a related word. Oh no, that's not allowed.\n\nWhat about using terms that imply gender without stating it? Like \"she,\" but that's a pronoun. Or \"female counterpart,\" but \"female\" is related. Maybe \"a person who is an adult woman,\" but again, \"woman\" is the target. Not allowed.\n\nAnother angle: Think of categories. Like \"a woman is a member of the species Homo sapiens, typically with certain biological characteristics.\" But",
