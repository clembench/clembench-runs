	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt faq\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - list\\ \tt - question\\ \tt - answer\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "faq," and the related words are "list," "question," and "answer." I need to describe "faq" without using those related words or the target word itself. The user has to guess it in three tries.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "faq" stands for "Frequently Asked Questions." But I can't use "question" or "answer" directly. Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts. "Frequently Asked Questions" is a list of common queries, but "list" is a related word, so I can't use that either. \\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, so maybe focus on the purpose of an FAQ. It's a collection of answers to common questions. But again, "question" and "answer" are off-limits. What's another way to describe it? Maybe "common queries" but "queries" might be too close to "questions." \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the structure. An FAQ is often a section on a website or document. But I don't know if that's helpful. Or maybe "resource for common information." Wait, but "information" is too vague. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the term "FAQ" is an acronym. Maybe mention that it's an abbreviation. But the user needs to guess the word, so maybe hint at the acronym. But the problem is the user might not know the acronym. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the target word is "faq," so the user needs to guess that
