The target word is \"faq,\" and the related words are \"list,\" \"question,\" and \"answer.\" I need to describe \"faq\" without using those related words or the target word itself. The user has to guess it in three tries.\n\nFirst, \"faq\" stands for \"Frequently Asked Questions.\" But I can't use \"question\" or \"answer\" directly. Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts. \"Frequently Asked Questions\" is a list of common queries, but \"list\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. \n\nHmm, so maybe focus on the purpose of an FAQ. It's a collection of answers to common questions. But again, \"question\" and \"answer\" are off-limits. What's another way to describe it? Maybe \"common queries\" but \"queries\" might be too close to \"questions.\" \n\nAlternatively, think about the structure. An FAQ is often a section on a website or document. But I don't know if that's helpful. Or maybe \"resource for common information.\" Wait, but \"information\" is too vague. \n\nAnother angle: the term \"FAQ\" is an acronym. Maybe mention that it's an abbreviation. But the user needs to guess the word, so maybe hint at the acronym. But the problem is the user might not know the acronym. \n\nWait, the target word is \"faq,\" so the user needs to guess that",
