The target word is \"just,\" and I need to describe it without using \"just\" or the related words: barely, fair, equitable. Hmm. So, the user is playing a collaborative game where they have to guess the word based on clues. The challenge is to give a concise clue that doesn't include the target or related words.\n\nFirst, I should think about the meanings of \"just.\" It can mean exactly, precisely, or it can relate to fairness. But since \"fair\" and \"equitable\" are related words, I can't use those. So maybe focus on the exactness aspect. Words like \"exactly,\" \"precisely,\" or \"only\" come to mind. But \"only\" might be too vague. Wait, \"barely\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. \n\nAnother angle: \"just\" as in the adverb, like \"just arrived.\" But how to describe that without using related words. Maybe \"exactly\" or \"precisely.\" But maybe the user is thinking of the adjective form, like \"just\" meaning fair. But since \"fair\" is a related word, I can't use that. \n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms for \"just\" that aren't in the related list. Words like \"correct,\" \"right,\" \"accurate.\" But \"correct\" might be too broad. Or \"exactly\" as in \"just",
