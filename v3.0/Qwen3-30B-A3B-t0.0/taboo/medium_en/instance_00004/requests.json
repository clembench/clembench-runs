It's a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns. But I can't say \"array\" or \"table,\" so I need alternative terms.\n\nMaybe start with \"rectangular grid of elements\" – that's descriptive. But maybe too long. The user wants short descriptions. What's another way? \"Structure with rows and columns\" – but \"structure\" might be too vague. \"System of interconnected elements\" – but \"system\" could be related. Wait, the related words are array, table, model. So \"array\" is a related word, so I can't use that. \n\nHow about \"organized grid for data\" – but \"grid\" is okay. Or \"framework of elements\" – but \"framework\" might not be specific enough. Maybe \"mathematical arrangement\" – but that's too vague. \n\nWait, the user said to be to the point. Let me think of synonyms for matrix. Maybe \"array\" is a related word, so I can't use that. What about \"matrix\" in the context of movies? Like the movie \"The Matrix,\" but that's a different context. But the target word is the general term, not the movie. \n\nAnother angle: a matrix is",
