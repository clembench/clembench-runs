It's a fixture used for eliminating waste. Maybe I can talk about its function. But I have to avoid the related words. So instead of saying \"used for urinating,\" maybe say \"used for waste disposal.\" Also, it's usually in a bathroom. But \"bathroom\" isn't a related word here. Wait, the related words are flush, restroom, urinate. So \"restroom\" is a related word. So I can't say \"restroom.\" Hmm. Maybe describe its appearance: a bowl with water, a seat, a handle. But the user wants short descriptions. Let me think of synonyms or associated items. Maybe \"sanitary fixture\" but that's a bit technical. Or \"toilet paper\" but that's an item used with it, not the toilet itself. Alternatively, think of the action: flushing, but \"flush\" is a related word. So can't use that. Maybe \"has a bowl and a seat, used for waste.\" But need to be concise. How about \"Fixture with a bowl and seat for waste disposal.\" That's short and avoids the restricted words. Let me check: no \"toilet,\" \"flush,\" \"restroom,\" \"urinate.\" Yeah,",
