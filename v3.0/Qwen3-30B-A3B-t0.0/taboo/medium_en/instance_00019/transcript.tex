	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt crucial\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - critical\\ \tt - important\\ \tt - pivotal\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "crucial," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: critical, important, pivotal. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "crucial" means something very important or essential. But I can't use "important" or "critical." Maybe think of words like vital, essential, key, or fundamental. But wait, "vital" is a synonym, but is it allowed? The rules say not to use the target word or related words. The related words given are critical, important, pivotal. So "vital" isn't on that list, so maybe it's okay. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of examples. Like, "crucial" is something that determines success or failure. So maybe "determines success" or "decisive." But "decisive" might be related. Wait, "decisive" isn't in the related words, so maybe that's okay. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "crucial" is like a turning point. So "turning point" or "pivotal moment," but "pivotal" is a related word, so I can't use that. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about "essential"? That's a synonym but not in the related list. So maybe "essential" is safe. Or "vital." Let me check the rules again. The user said not to use the target word or
