Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"bill\" can mean a document showing money owed, like an invoice. But I can't say \"invoice.\" Maybe \"document requesting payment\"? Wait, but \"pay\" is a related word. Hmm. Alternatively, \"statement of costs\" – but \"costs\" isn't related. Or \"record of expenses\"? Not sure. Another meaning of \"bill\" is a piece of legislation, like a proposed law. But the user might be thinking of the financial term. Maybe I should go with the financial aspect.\n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms. \"Invoice\" is related, so can't use that. \"Statement,\" \"receipt,\" \"demand\"? But \"demand\" might be okay. Or \"sum due.\" Wait, \"sum\" is not related. Maybe \"amount owed.\" But \"owed\" is part of \"charge\" maybe? Not sure. Let me check the rules again. The related words are pay, charge, invoice. So \"amount owed\" is safe. Or \"document for payment.\" But \"payment\" is related to \"pay.\" Maybe \"document showing what's owed.\" That's a bit long. Or \"statement of charges\" – but \"charges\" is a related word. Oh no, can't use that.",
