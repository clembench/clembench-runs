	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt bill\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - pay\\ \tt - charge\\ \tt - invoice\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "bill," and the related words are "pay," "charge," and "invoice." I need to describe "bill" without using those words or their variants. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "bill" can mean a document showing money owed, like an invoice. But I can't say "invoice." Maybe "document requesting payment"? Wait, but "pay" is a related word. Hmm. Alternatively, "statement of costs" – but "costs" isn't related. Or "record of expenses"? Not sure. Another meaning of "bill" is a piece of legislation, like a proposed law. But the user might be thinking of the financial term. Maybe I should go with the financial aspect.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of synonyms. "Invoice" is related, so can't use that. "Statement," "receipt," "demand"? But "demand" might be okay. Or "sum due." Wait, "sum" is not related. Maybe "amount owed." But "owed" is part of "charge" maybe? Not sure. Let me check the rules again. The related words are pay, charge, invoice. So "amount owed" is safe. Or "document for payment." But "payment" is related to "pay." Maybe "document showing what's owed." That's a bit long. Or "statement of charges" – but "charges" is a related word. Oh no, can't use that.
