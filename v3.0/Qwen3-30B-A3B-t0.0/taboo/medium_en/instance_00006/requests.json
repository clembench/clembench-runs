Let me think about what a steward does. They manage things, maybe on a ship or in an organization. They could be in charge of operations or overseeing tasks. But I can't use \"caretaker\" or \"servant.\" Maybe focus on their role in managing or supervising. Words like \"overseer,\" \"manager,\" or \"administrator\" come to mind. Wait, but I need to make sure those aren't related words. The related words are specific, so maybe \"overseer\" is okay. Alternatively, think about the responsibilities: ensuring things run smoothly, handling logistics. Maybe \"someone who manages operations\" but that's a bit vague. Another angle: in a ship, a steward handles passenger services. But I can't mention ship. Maybe \"responsible for maintaining order and services in a setting.\" Hmm. Need to be concise. How about \"manager of a ship's operations\"? But \"manager\" might be too general. Alternatively, \"oversees daily operations and services.\" That's better. Let me check if \"oversees\" is allowed. Since the related words are attendant, caretaker, servant, and \"oversees\" isn't one of them. Yeah, that should work. So the clue could be \"Oversees daily operations and services in",
