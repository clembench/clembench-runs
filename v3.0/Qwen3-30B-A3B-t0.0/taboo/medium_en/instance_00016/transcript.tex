	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt emphasize\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - highlight\\ \tt - underscore\\ \tt - stress\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "emphasize," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: highlight, underscore, stress. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "emphasize" means to give special importance to something. So maybe words like "stress," but wait, "stress" is a related word and I can't use that. Hmm. What other synonyms are there? Maybe "highlight" is also a related word. So I need to avoid those.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternative approaches: Think about the action of making something more noticeable. Words like "draw attention to," "focus on," "accentuate." But "accentuate" might be similar. Wait, is "accentuate" a related word? The related words given are highlight, underscore, stress. So maybe "accentuate" is okay. Let me check. The user said not to use the target word or the related words. So if "accentuate" isn't listed, it's allowed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: The opposite of emphasize is "downplay" or "minimize," but that's not helpful here. Maybe "stress" is a related word, so I can't use that. What about "emphasize" in different contexts? Like, in writing, you might "underline" something, but "underscore" is a related word. So can't use that either.\\ \tt \\ \tt So possible clues: "Give special importance to," "Make something
