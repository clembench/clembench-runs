Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\n\nFirst, \"emphasize\" means to give special importance to something. So maybe words like \"stress,\" but wait, \"stress\" is a related word and I can't use that. Hmm. What other synonyms are there? Maybe \"highlight\" is also a related word. So I need to avoid those.\n\nAlternative approaches: Think about the action of making something more noticeable. Words like \"draw attention to,\" \"focus on,\" \"accentuate.\" But \"accentuate\" might be similar. Wait, is \"accentuate\" a related word? The related words given are highlight, underscore, stress. So maybe \"accentuate\" is okay. Let me check. The user said not to use the target word or the related words. So if \"accentuate\" isn't listed, it's allowed.\n\nAnother angle: The opposite of emphasize is \"downplay\" or \"minimize,\" but that's not helpful here. Maybe \"stress\" is a related word, so I can't use that. What about \"emphasize\" in different contexts? Like, in writing, you might \"underline\" something, but \"underscore\" is a related word. So can't use that either.\n\nSo possible clues: \"Give special importance to,\" \"Make something",
