	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt demo\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - rally\\ \tt - show\\ \tt - model\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "demo," and the related words are rally, show, model. I need to describe "demo" without using those words or their variants. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "demo" can stand for "demonstration," which is a type of presentation. But I can't use "show" directly. Maybe "performance" or "exhibition"? Wait, "show" is a related word, so I can't use that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "demo" is short for "demonstration," but also in music, a demo is a sample. But the user might be thinking of the tech or event context. \\ \tt \\ \tt What's another synonym for demo? Maybe "preview" or "sample." But "sample" might be too vague. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the action: "demonstrate" is the verb. But I can't use "show" or "model" (since "model" is a related word). \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words are rally, show, model. So I can't use those. So "demo" as in a music demo, but how to describe that without using related words. \\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe "short version of a song" but that's specific. Or "preview" as in a trial. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of "demo" as in a live performance, but "rally" is related. Hmm. \\ \tt \\ \tt What's a one-word clue? "Preview" could work
