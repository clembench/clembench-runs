I need to describe \"demo\" without using those words or their variants. Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"demo\" can stand for \"demonstration,\" which is a type of presentation. But I can't use \"show\" directly. Maybe \"performance\" or \"exhibition\"? Wait, \"show\" is a related word, so I can't use that. \n\nAnother angle: \"demo\" is short for \"demonstration,\" but also in music, a demo is a sample. But the user might be thinking of the tech or event context. \n\nWhat's another synonym for demo? Maybe \"preview\" or \"sample.\" But \"sample\" might be too vague. \n\nAlternatively, think of the action: \"demonstrate\" is the verb. But I can't use \"show\" or \"model\" (since \"model\" is a related word). \n\nWait, the related words are rally, show, model. So I can't use those. So \"demo\" as in a music demo, but how to describe that without using related words. \n\nMaybe \"short version of a song\" but that's specific. Or \"preview\" as in a trial. \n\nAlternatively, think of \"demo\" as in a live performance, but \"rally\" is related. Hmm. \n\nWhat's a one-word clue? \"Preview\" could work",
