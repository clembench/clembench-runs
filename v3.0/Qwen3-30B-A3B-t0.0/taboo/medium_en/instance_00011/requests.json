Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"Murphy\" is a surname, but maybe it's also a name associated with something else. Wait, there's the \"Murphy's Law\" which is about things going wrong. But I can't use \"Murphy\" directly. The related words include \"Irish,\" so maybe the surname is of Irish origin? But I can't mention \"Irish\" either. \n\nAnother angle: \"Potato\" is a related word. Maybe there's a connection to a potato? Like a \"potato\" in slang? Or maybe a \"con\" as in a confidence trick? But I can't use \"con\" either. \n\nWait, \"Murphy\" could be part of a phrase. For example, \"Murphy's Law\" is a common term. But I can't say \"Murphy's Law\" because that uses the target word. So maybe describe the concept without the name. \"A principle stating that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.\" But the problem is that the other player might not know that. But the clue has to be short. \n\nAlternatively, think of the surname. Maybe a famous person named Murphy? Like the actor or a historical figure? But that might not",
