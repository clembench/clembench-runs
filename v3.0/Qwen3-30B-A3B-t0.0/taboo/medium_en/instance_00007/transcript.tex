	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "queue," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words like line, row, or chain. Let me think about what a queue is. It's a line of people or things waiting, right? But I can't say "line." Maybe focus on the action of waiting. Like "waiting in order" or "people waiting." But maybe that's too vague. What's another aspect? Maybe the structure, like a sequence. But "sequence" isn't a related word. Wait, the related words are line, row, chain. So I can't use those. Hmm. How about "a series of items awaiting their turn"? Or "a sequence of elements in order." Wait, but maybe the player knows the related words. Alternatively, think of the pronunciation. "Queue" is pronounced like "cue," but that might not help. Or maybe the shape, like a straight line, but again, "line" is related. Maybe use synonyms for line, like "row" but that's a related word. Oh, the rules say not to use related words. So I need to avoid "line," "row," "chain." So maybe describe it as a group of people or things waiting in a particular order. But how to phrase that without using the forbidden words. Maybe "a group waiting in a specific order" or "a sequence of entities awaiting their turn." But maybe too abstract.
