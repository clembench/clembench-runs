	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt normally\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - unremarkably\\ \tt - regularly\\ \tt - usually\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "normally," and the related words are "unremarkably," "regularly," and "usually." I need to describe "normally" without using any of those related words or the target itself. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt "Normally" means in a usual or standard way. So maybe words like "typically," "as usual," or "commonly." But I have to check if those are allowed. The related words given are "unremarkably," "regularly," "usually." So "usually" is a related word, so I can't use that. "Regularly" is also related. "Unremarkably" is another one. So I need to avoid those.\\ \tt \\ \tt So possible clues could be "typically," "generally," "usually" (but wait, "usually" is a related word, so I can't use that). Hmm. What's another synonym? Maybe "as expected" or "in the usual manner." But maybe too long. The user wants short descriptions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "normally" can mean according to the normal way, so maybe "standardly" but is that a word? Not sure. Or "commonplace." Or "usual way." But "usual" is part of the related words? Wait, the related words are "unremarkably," "regularly," "usually." So "usual" isn't listed, but "usually" is. So maybe "
