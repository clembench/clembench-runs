	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt sword\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - blade\\ \tt - weapon\\ \tt - sharp\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "sword," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: blade, weapon, sharp. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what are the key characteristics of a sword? It's a weapon, but I can't say "weapon." It has a blade, but "blade" is also a related word. So I need to describe it without those. Maybe focus on its parts or functions. A sword is used for cutting or stabbing. It has a hilt, a guard, maybe a crossguard. But I don't know if those terms are allowed. Wait, the related words are blade, weapon, sharp. So hilt and guard might be okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about common associations. Like, it's a tool for combat, but again, "combat" might be too vague. Or maybe mention that it's a long, pointed object. But "pointed" might not be specific enough. What about "used in duels" or "held by a knight"? But that might be too specific. Or "has a metal edge." But "edge" could be related to blade. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: synonyms for sword that aren't in the related words. Like "blade" is related, so can't use that. Maybe "cutting tool" but that's too generic. Or "metal stick with a sharp end." But "sharp" is a related word. Oh, right,
