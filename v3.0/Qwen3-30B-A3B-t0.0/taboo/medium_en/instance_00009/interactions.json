Let me think.\n\nFirst, what are the key characteristics of a sword? It's a weapon, but I can't say \"weapon.\" It has a blade, but \"blade\" is also a related word. So I need to describe it without those. Maybe focus on its parts or functions. A sword is used for cutting or stabbing. It has a hilt, a guard, maybe a crossguard. But I don't know if those terms are allowed. Wait, the related words are blade, weapon, sharp. So hilt and guard might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, think about common associations. Like, it's a tool for combat, but again, \"combat\" might be too vague. Or maybe mention that it's a long, pointed object. But \"pointed\" might not be specific enough. What about \"used in duels\" or \"held by a knight\"? But that might be too specific. Or \"has a metal edge.\" But \"edge\" could be related to blade. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: synonyms for sword that aren't in the related words. Like \"blade\" is related, so can't use that. Maybe \"cutting tool\" but that's too generic. Or \"metal stick with a sharp end.\" But \"sharp\" is a related word. Oh, right,",
