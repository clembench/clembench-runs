Let me think about what \"sweep\" means. It can be a motion, like moving a broom, or it can mean to clean something. But I can't use \"clean\" directly. Maybe focus on the action. Like \"move a broom across the floor\" but that's too long. Or \"a quick motion with a broom.\" Wait, but \"brush\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe \"a broad, quick motion\" or \"to move something in a wide arc.\" Alternatively, think of synonyms. \"Sweep\" can also mean to carry away, like a wave sweeping the shore. But how to describe that without the forbidden words. Maybe \"carry away in a wide motion\" or \"move in a broad arc.\" Let me check if any of these are too close. \"Carry away\" might be okay. Or \"a broad, swift motion.\" Yeah, that's short and to the point. Let me go with that.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: A broad, swift motion.<|im_end|>",
