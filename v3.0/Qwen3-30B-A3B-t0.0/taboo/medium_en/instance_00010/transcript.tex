	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt surprise\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - party\\ \tt - shock\\ \tt - unexpected\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "surprise," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: party, shock, unexpected. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does "surprise" mean? It's something that happens suddenly and is not expected. But I can't use "unexpected" directly. Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts. Words like "shock" are related, but I can't use that either. So maybe focus on the effect or the situation.\\ \tt \\ \tt A surprise could be an event that catches someone off guard. Maybe describe it as an event that happens without prior knowledge. But "without prior knowledge" might be too vague. Alternatively, think of examples. Like a surprise party, but "party" is a related word, so I can't mention that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: emotions. Surprise is an emotion. But how to describe it without using the word. Maybe "a sudden feeling of astonishment." Wait, but "astonishment" might be okay. Or "something that causes a jolt of amazement." But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the opposite: expected. But that's not helpful. Maybe use a metaphor. Like "a plot twist in a story" but that's specific. Or "an unforeseen occurrence." Wait, "unforeseen" is similar to unexpected, which is a related word. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt What about "a sudden event that catches someone off guard"?
