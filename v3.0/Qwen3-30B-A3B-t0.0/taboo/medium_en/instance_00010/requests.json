Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does \"surprise\" mean? It's something that happens suddenly and is not expected. But I can't use \"unexpected\" directly. Maybe think of synonyms or related concepts. Words like \"shock\" are related, but I can't use that either. So maybe focus on the effect or the situation.\n\nA surprise could be an event that catches someone off guard. Maybe describe it as an event that happens without prior knowledge. But \"without prior knowledge\" might be too vague. Alternatively, think of examples. Like a surprise party, but \"party\" is a related word, so I can't mention that. \n\nAnother angle: emotions. Surprise is an emotion. But how to describe it without using the word. Maybe \"a sudden feeling of astonishment.\" Wait, but \"astonishment\" might be okay. Or \"something that causes a jolt of amazement.\" But I need to be concise.\n\nAlternatively, think of the opposite: expected. But that's not helpful. Maybe use a metaphor. Like \"a plot twist in a story\" but that's specific. Or \"an unforeseen occurrence.\" Wait, \"unforeseen\" is similar to unexpected, which is a related word. Hmm.\n\nWhat about \"a sudden event that catches someone off guard\"?",
