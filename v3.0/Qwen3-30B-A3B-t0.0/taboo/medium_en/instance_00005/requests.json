Alabama is a U.S. state, but I can't say \"state\" or \"USA.\" Maybe focus on other aspects. What's unique about Alabama? It's a place, maybe mention something like a southern U.S. location? But \"southern\" might be okay. Wait, the related words are USA, state, river. So I can't use those. Maybe think of landmarks or symbols. The state bird is the yellowhammer, but that's specific. Or the capital, Montgomery? But the player might not know that. Alternatively, think of the word's structure. \"Alabama\" has a certain rhythm. Or maybe think of the word as a proper noun. Wait, the user said not to use the target word or related words. So I need to describe it in a way that hints without those terms. Maybe mention it's a place in the southeastern U.S., but \"southeastern\" might be okay. Alternatively, think of the word's pronunciation. Or maybe think of the word as a name that's also a river? Wait, there's a Alabama River, but \"river\" is a related word, so I can't mention that. Hmm. Maybe focus on the fact that it's a U.S. state but avoid the word",
