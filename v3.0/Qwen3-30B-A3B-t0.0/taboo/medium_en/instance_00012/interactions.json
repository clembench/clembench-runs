Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does \"demographic\" mean? It refers to characteristics of a population, like age, gender, income, etc. But I can't say \"people\" or \"group.\" Maybe focus on the data aspect. \"Demographic\" is often used in contexts like market research or surveys. So maybe something like \"data about characteristics of a population\" but I need to avoid \"statistic\" as well. Wait, the related words are people, group, statistic. So I can't use those. \n\nAlternative approach: Think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe \"characteristics used to categorize populations\" but \"categorize\" might be too vague. Or \"features that describe a population's traits.\" Hmm. Or \"information about segments of a population.\" Wait, \"segments\" might be okay. Let me check the rules again. The related words are people, group, statistic. So \"segments\" isn't listed, so that's allowed. \n\nAnother angle: Think of where demographic data is used. Like in surveys, research, marketing. So maybe \"data used in market research to understand different segments.\" But maybe too long. Need to be concise. \n\nAlternatively, \"population traits analyzed in research.\" But \"population\" might be related to \"people,\" but the",
