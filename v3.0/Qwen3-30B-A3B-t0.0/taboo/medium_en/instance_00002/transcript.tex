	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt prospective\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - foresight\\ \tt - potential\\ \tt - future\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "prospective," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: foresight, potential, future. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does "prospective" mean? It relates to the future, like something that is expected to happen. But I can't use "future" directly. Maybe synonyms like "coming," "upcoming," or "anticipated." But I have to be careful not to use any related words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "Prospective" can mean having the possibility of becoming something. So maybe "possible" or "potential," but "potential" is a related word. Oops, can't use that. How about "possible" or "likely"?\\ \tt \\ \tt Also, "prospective" is often used in contexts like "prospective student" or "prospective buyer," meaning someone who is expected to become something. So maybe "expected" or "anticipated."\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said not to use the target word or related words. So "future" is out. Let me think of other synonyms. Maybe "upcoming," "next," "coming," "anticipated," "expected," "possible," "likely."\\ \tt \\ \tt But I need to make a clue that's concise. Maybe "Expected to happen in the future" but "future" is forbidden. So rephrase: "Anticipated to occur later" or "Likely to happen soon." But maybe too vague.
