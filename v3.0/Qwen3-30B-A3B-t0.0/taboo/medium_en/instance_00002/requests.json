Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does \"prospective\" mean? It relates to the future, like something that is expected to happen. But I can't use \"future\" directly. Maybe synonyms like \"coming,\" \"upcoming,\" or \"anticipated.\" But I have to be careful not to use any related words.\n\nAnother angle: \"Prospective\" can mean having the possibility of becoming something. So maybe \"possible\" or \"potential,\" but \"potential\" is a related word. Oops, can't use that. How about \"possible\" or \"likely\"?\n\nAlso, \"prospective\" is often used in contexts like \"prospective student\" or \"prospective buyer,\" meaning someone who is expected to become something. So maybe \"expected\" or \"anticipated.\"\n\nWait, the user said not to use the target word or related words. So \"future\" is out. Let me think of other synonyms. Maybe \"upcoming,\" \"next,\" \"coming,\" \"anticipated,\" \"expected,\" \"possible,\" \"likely.\"\n\nBut I need to make a clue that's concise. Maybe \"Expected to happen in the future\" but \"future\" is forbidden. So rephrase: \"Anticipated to occur later\" or \"Likely to happen soon.\" But maybe too vague.\n\n",
