Georgia is a U.S. state, but I can't say \"state.\" It's also a country, but \"country\" is off-limits. Maybe focus on other aspects. The capital is Atlanta, but I can't mention that either. What else? It's known for peaches, maybe? Or the Peach State nickname. But is that too indirect? Alternatively, think about its location. It's in the southeastern U.S. But how to describe that without using \"state\"? Maybe mention it's a southeastern U.S. region? Wait, but the player might not know. Alternatively, think of other characteristics. Maybe the flag has a red and white design? Or the abbreviation GA? But abbreviations might not be helpful. Another angle: it's a place where you might find the Appalachian Mountains? Or maybe the Okefenokee Swamp? Not sure if that's too specific. Alternatively, think of famous people from Georgia, like Martin Luther King Jr., but that might not be helpful. Maybe the fact that it's a common name for a state? Wait, but the player needs to guess \"georgia,\" so maybe focus on the fact that it's a U.S. state with a specific nickname. But I can't use \"state.\" Hmm",
