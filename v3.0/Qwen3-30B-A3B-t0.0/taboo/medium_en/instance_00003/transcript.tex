	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt violation\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - transgression\\ \tt - misdemeanor\\ \tt - offence\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, the target word is "violation," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: transgression, misdemeanor, offence. Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "violation" means breaking a law, rule, or agreement. So maybe words like "breach," "infraction," "default," or "noncompliance." But I have to check if those are allowed. The related words are listed, so I need to avoid those. Let me see: "breach" is a possible clue. Or "breaking a rule." But maybe more specific. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: types of violations. Like a legal term, but not using the related words. Maybe "act of breaking a law" but that's too long. Need to be concise. "Legal breach" might work. Or "rule breaking." But "rule breaking" is pretty straightforward. Wait, the user said to be short and to the point. So maybe "breach of law" or "legal infraction." But "infraction" is similar to the related words? Let me check the related words again: transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So "infraction" isn't listed, so it's allowed. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "violation" can be a synonym like "breach," "infringement," "contravention." Let me pick one. "Breach" is a good one. So the clue
