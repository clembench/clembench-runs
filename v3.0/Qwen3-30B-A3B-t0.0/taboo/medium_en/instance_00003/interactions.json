Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\n\nFirst, \"violation\" means breaking a law, rule, or agreement. So maybe words like \"breach,\" \"infraction,\" \"default,\" or \"noncompliance.\" But I have to check if those are allowed. The related words are listed, so I need to avoid those. Let me see: \"breach\" is a possible clue. Or \"breaking a rule.\" But maybe more specific. \n\nAnother angle: types of violations. Like a legal term, but not using the related words. Maybe \"act of breaking a law\" but that's too long. Need to be concise. \"Legal breach\" might work. Or \"rule breaking.\" But \"rule breaking\" is pretty straightforward. Wait, the user said to be short and to the point. So maybe \"breach of law\" or \"legal infraction.\" But \"infraction\" is similar to the related words? Let me check the related words again: transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So \"infraction\" isn't listed, so it's allowed. \n\nAlternatively, \"violation\" can be a synonym like \"breach,\" \"infringement,\" \"contravention.\" Let me pick one. \"Breach\" is a good one.
