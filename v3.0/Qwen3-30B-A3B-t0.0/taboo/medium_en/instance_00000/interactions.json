Let me think about what a declaration is. It's a formal statement, right? Like when someone makes an official announcement. Maybe words like \"statement,\" \"announcement,\" or \"proclamation\" could work. But I have to make sure not to use any of the related words. Let me check the synonyms. \"Declaration\" can also be called a \"pronouncement\" or \"announcement.\" Wait, \"resolution\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe \"formal statement\" is safe. Or \"public announcement.\" Let me make sure none of the related words are in there. \"Law\" isn't there. \"Testimony\" is about giving evidence, which is different. So maybe \"A formal statement made publicly\" or \"An official announcement.\" That should work. Let me pick the shortest one. \"Formal statement\" is concise. But maybe \"public announcement\" is better. Wait, the user said to be to the point. Let me go with \"A formal statement made publicly.\" But maybe even shorter: \"Formal public statement.\" Yeah, that's short and to the point. Doesn't use any forbidden words. Okay, that should be the clue.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: Formal public statement",
