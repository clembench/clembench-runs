Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5. The first row is □ X X X □. Then the next three rows are the same: □ X X X □. Wait, no, the user wrote the target grid as:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X □\nRow 2: □ X X X □\nRow 3: □ X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X □\nRow 5: □ X X X □\n\nSo all five rows are the same: each has a square, then three Xs, then a square. So the middle three columns are all Xs, and the first and last columns are squares. So the target grid has a vertical line of Xs in the middle three columns, with squares on the sides.\n\nNow, Distractor 1 has each row as □ □ X X X. So the first two columns are squares, then three Xs. So the Xs start from the third column. So the Xs are shifted to the right compared to the target.\n\nDistractor 2 has rows as X X X □ □. So the first three columns are Xs, then two squares. So the X",
