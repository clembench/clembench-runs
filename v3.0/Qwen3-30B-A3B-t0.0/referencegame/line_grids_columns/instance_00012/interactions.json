Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is □ X X □ X. So, in each row, the first cell is empty, then two X's, then empty, then X. So positions 1, 4 are empty, and 2,3,5 are filled. Let me check all rows. Yes, all five rows are the same: □ X X □ X. So the target has a pattern where in each row, the middle three cells are X, but the first and fourth are empty. Wait, no, wait. Let me count again. The first row is □ X X □ X. So positions 1: □, 2: X, 3: X, 4: □, 5: X. So in each row, columns 2,3,5 are X, and 1,4 are empty. So the X's are in columns 2, 3, and 5. But in each row, the fourth column is empty. \n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1: Each row is □ □ X X X. So first two cells empty, then three X's. So columns 3,4,5 are X. So the X's are in",
