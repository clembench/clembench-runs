Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first column is all X's. Then the next three columns have a pattern. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 1: X □ □ X X\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: X □ □ X X\nRow 4: X □ □ X X\nRow 5: X □ □ X X\n\nSo, the first column is all X's. The second and third columns are all empty (□), and the fourth and fifth columns are X's. So, the first column is all X, then two empty, then two X's. So the pattern is X, □, □, X, X in each row.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1:\n\nAll rows are □ □ X X X. So the first two columns are empty, then three X's. So the first column is all □, which is different from the target's first column being all X. So that's a key difference.\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nEach row is X □ X X □. So first column X, second □, third X, fourth X, fifth",
