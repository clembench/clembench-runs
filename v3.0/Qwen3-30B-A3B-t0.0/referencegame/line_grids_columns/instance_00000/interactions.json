Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid has the first two columns as empty (□) and the last three as filled (X). So, rows are like □ □ X X X repeated five times. \n\nNow, Distractor 1 has the first column as X, then two □, then two X. So each row is X □ □ X X. That's different from the target because the target's first two are □, but here the first is X. \n\nDistractor 2 has the first column as □, then X X X, and the last as □. So rows are □ X X X □. Here, the middle three are X, but in the target, the last three are X. So the position of the Xs is different. \n\nSo the target's unique feature is that the first two columns are empty, and the last three are filled. The distractors have different patterns. So the referring expression should mention the first two columns being empty and the last three filled. Maybe something like \"The first two columns are empty and the last three are filled.\" But I need to make sure it's concise and precise. Let me check again. \n\nYes, that's correct. The target's structure is distinct from both distractors",
