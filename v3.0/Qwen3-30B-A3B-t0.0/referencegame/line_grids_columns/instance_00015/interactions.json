Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is X □ X X □. So, the first column is all X's. Then the second is all □, third is X, fourth is X, fifth is □. So, in each row, the pattern is X, empty, X, X, empty. So the first column is all filled, the second is empty, then third and fourth are filled, fifth empty. So the target grid has a vertical line of X's in the first column, and then in the other columns, there's a pattern of empty, filled, filled, empty. Wait, but each row is the same. So the entire grid has the first column as X's, second as empty, third and fourth as X's, fifth as empty. So the target grid has a vertical line of X's in column 1, and columns 3 and 4 are all X's. But the second and fifth columns are all empty.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1: All rows are □ □ X X X. So first two columns are empty, then three X's. So columns 1 and 2 are empty, columns 3-5 are X. So the target's first column is X, but in",
