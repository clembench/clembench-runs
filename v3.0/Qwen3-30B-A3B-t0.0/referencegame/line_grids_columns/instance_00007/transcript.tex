	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to describe the target grid in a way that distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\\ \tt \\ \tt The target grid is 5x5. The first row is □ X X X □. Then the next three rows are the same: □ X X X □. Wait, no, the user wrote the target grid as:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: □ X X X □\\ \tt Row 2: □ X X X □\\ \tt Row 3: □ X X X □\\ \tt Row 4: □ X X X □\\ \tt Row 5: □ X X X □\\ \tt \\ \tt So all five rows are the same: each has a square, then three Xs, then a square. So the middle three columns are all Xs, and the first and last columns are squares. So the target grid has a vertical line of Xs in the middle three columns, with squares on the sides.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, Distractor 1 has each row as □ □ X X X. So the first two columns are squares, then three Xs. So the Xs start from the third column. So the Xs are shifted to the right compared to the target.\\ \tt \\ \tt Distractor 2 has rows as X X X □ □. So the first three columns are Xs, then two squares. So the X
