	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to describe the target grid in a way that distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\\ \tt \\ \tt The target grid is 5x5. The first row is all X's. Then three rows of all squares (□), then another row of X's, and then another row of squares. Wait, no, let me check again. The target grid as given:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 2: □ □ □ □ □\\ \tt Row 3: □ □ □ □ □\\ \tt Row 4: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 5: □ □ □ □ □\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first row is all X, then two rows of squares, then a row of X, then another row of squares. Wait, no, rows 2, 3 are squares, then row 4 is X, then row 5 is squares. So the X's are in rows 1, 4. The squares are in rows 2,3,5.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, the distractor 1:\\ \tt \\ \tt Each row is □ □ □ X X. So every row has the first three as squares and the last two as X. So all five rows are same. So the X's are in columns 4 and 5, all rows.\\ \tt \\ \tt Distractor
