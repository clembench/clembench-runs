Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5. The first row is X □ □ X X. Then the next four rows are the same: X □ □ X X. So, looking at each column:\n\nColumn 1: All X's. Because every row starts with X. So column 1 is all X's.\n\nColumn 2: Each row has a □ in the second position. So column 2 is all □.\n\nColumn 3: Similarly, third position is □ for all rows. So column 3 is all □.\n\nColumns 4 and 5: Each row has X X in the last two positions. So columns 4 and 5 are all X's.\n\nSo the target grid has the first column as all X's, columns 2 and 3 as all □, and columns 4 and 5 as all X's.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1: The first row is □ □ □ X X. All rows are the same. So column 1 is □, columns 2-3 are □, columns 4-5 X. So the first column is all □ here, unlike the target which has all X's in column 1.\n\nDistractor",
