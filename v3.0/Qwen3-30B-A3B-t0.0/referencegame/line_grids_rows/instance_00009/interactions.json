Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5. The first three columns are empty (□) and the last two are filled (X). So each row is □ □ □ X X. All rows are the same. So the target has the first three columns empty and the last two filled.\n\nNow, Distractor 1: Each row is □ □ X X X. So the first two columns are empty, then three Xs. So the difference here is that the third column is X in distractor 1, whereas in the target, the third column is empty. So the target has three empty columns followed by two Xs, while distractor 1 has two empty, then three Xs.\n\nDistractor 2: Each row starts with X, then □ □, then X X. So the first column is X, then two empty, then two Xs. So the first column is filled here, which is different from the target where the first three are empty. Also, the structure here is X □ □ X X. So the target's first three are empty, while distractor 2 has the first column as X.\n\nSo the key differences are in the number of empty columns and their positions. The target has three empty",
