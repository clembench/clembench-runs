Let me start by analyzing each grid.\n\nThe target grid has the first two columns as empty (□) and the last three as X. So, rows are like □ □ X X X. All rows are the same. Now, looking at the distractors.\n\nDistractor 1 has the first three columns as □ and then X X. So, □ □ □ X X. So, the first three columns are empty, which is different from the target's first two. Distractor 2 has the first column as X, then □ □, then X X. So, X □ □ X X. So, the first column is filled, which is different from the target where the first two are empty.\n\nSo the key difference is the number of empty columns on the left. Target has two empty columns, then three Xs. Distractor 1 has three empty, then two Xs. Distractor 2 has one X, then two empty, then two Xs.\n\nSo the referring expression should mention the first two columns being empty and the last three filled. But I need to phrase it in a way that distinguishes it from the others. Maybe something like \"The first two columns are empty, followed by three filled columns.\" But maybe more precise.\n\nAlternatively",
