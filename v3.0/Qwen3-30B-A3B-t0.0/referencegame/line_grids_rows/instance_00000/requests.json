Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5. The first row is all X's. Then three rows of all squares (□), then another row of X's, and then another row of squares. Wait, no, let me check again. The target grid as given:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 3: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 4: X X X X X\nRow 5: □ □ □ □ □\n\nSo, the first row is all X, then two rows of squares, then a row of X, then another row of squares. Wait, no, rows 2, 3 are squares, then row 4 is X, then row 5 is squares. So the X's are in rows 1, 4. The squares are in rows 2,3,5.\n\nNow, the distractor 1:\n\nEach row is □ □ □ X X. So every row has the first three as squares and the last two as X. So all five rows are same. So the X's are in columns 4 and 5, all rows.\n\nDistractor ",
