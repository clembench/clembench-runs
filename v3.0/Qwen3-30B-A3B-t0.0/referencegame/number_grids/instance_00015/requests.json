Let me start by analyzing each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid:\n\nRow 1: X X X X □\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: X □ □ □ X\nRow 5: X X X X □\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: X X X X □\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X □\nRow 4: □ □ □ X □\nRow 5: X X X X □\n\nComparing target and Distractor 1, the main difference seems to be in row 4. Target's row 4 is X □ □ □ X, while Distractor 1's row 4 is □ □ □ X □. So the target has X's at the first and last positions of row 4, whereas Distractor 1 has a single X in the middle. Also, looking at other rows, maybe other differences? Let me check.\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: �",
