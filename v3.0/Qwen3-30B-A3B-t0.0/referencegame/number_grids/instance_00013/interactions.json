Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nSo, the first row has a square followed by four Xs. The second row has a square, X, then two squares, then X. The third and fourth rows are similar to the second. The fifth row is like the first.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nComparing to the target, the third row in Distractor 1 has all Xs except the first and last, which are same as target's first and fifth rows. So, the target's third row has two squares in the middle, while Distractor 1's third row is filled except for the first and last. So the target's third row is different here",
