Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all X's. Then the next four rows have four empty cells (□) and then an X at the end. So each of the rows 2-5 has four □ followed by an X. So the rightmost column is all X's except the first row, which is all X's. Wait, no, the first row is all X's. So the first row is X X X X X. Then rows 2-5 have □ □ □ □ X. So the fifth column (since it's 5 columns) is X in all rows. Wait, no, the first row's fifth column is X, and rows 2-5 have X in the fifth column. So the entire fifth column is X's. But the first row is all X's. So the target grid has a full row of X's in the first row, and the fifth column is all X's. But maybe that's not the key difference.\n\nNow looking at Distractor 1. The first grid: the first row is □ X X X X. Then the next rows: □ X □ □ X, and so on. So the first",
