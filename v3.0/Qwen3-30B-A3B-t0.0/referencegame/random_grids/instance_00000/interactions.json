Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nHmm, this looks like a checkerboard pattern. Each row alternates between empty and filled, starting with empty in the first row. Then the next row starts with X, and so on. So the pattern is consistent, alternating every cell. So it's a regular checkerboard.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X □ X\nRow 2: X □ X X □\nRow 3: □ X □ X X\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X X □ □\n\nThis seems different. Let me check the patterns. For example, row 1 has □ X X □ X. So the first row starts with empty, then X, X, empty, X. That's not alternating.",
