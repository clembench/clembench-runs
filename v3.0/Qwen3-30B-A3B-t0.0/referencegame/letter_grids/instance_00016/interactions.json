So □ □ □ X X.\nRow 3: Two □, then two X's, then a □. So □ □ X X □.\nRow 4: One X, then two X's, then two □. Wait, row 4 is □ X X □ □. So first cell is □, then X, X, then □, □.\nRow 5: All X's again.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: All X's.\nRow 2: X, □, X, □, X. So alternating X and □, but starting and ending with X.\nRow 3: All X's again.\nRow 4: Same as row 2: X, □, X, □, X.\nRow 5: All X's.\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: All X's.\nRow 2: X followed by four □?
