Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is 5x5. The first row is all X's. The second row starts with X followed by four squares. Then the third and fourth rows are similar to the second. The fifth row is all X's again. So, the middle three rows (rows 2-4) have a single X at the start and then four empty cells. Wait, no, row 2 is X followed by four □, rows 3 and 4 are the same. So the target grid has a vertical line of X's on the left side, and the rest are empty except the first and last rows.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1. The first row is all X's. Second row same as target: X followed by four □. Third row is all X's. Fourth row same as second: X followed by four □. Fifth row all X's. So Distractor 1 has the middle three rows alternating between all X's and the X followed by four □. Wait, no. Let me check again. Distractor 1's third row is all X's. So rows 2, 4 are X □ □ □ □, and row 3 is all X. So the vertical line",
