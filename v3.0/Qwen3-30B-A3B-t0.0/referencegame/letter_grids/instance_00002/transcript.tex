	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to describe the target grid in a way that distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all X's. The second row is X, □, X, □, X. Third row all X's again. Fourth row same as the second: X, □, X, □, X. Fifth row all X's. So the pattern here is that the even rows (second and fourth) have alternating X and □, starting and ending with X. The odd rows are all X's.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, looking at Distractor 1. The first row is all X's. Second row: X, □, □, □, □. Third row all X's. Fourth row same as second: X, □, □, □, □. Fifth row all X's. So here, the even rows have a single X followed by four □s. That's different from the target, where even rows have alternating X and □.\\ \tt \\ \tt Distractor 2: First row all X's. Second row X, □, □, □, □. Third row is X, □, □, □, □. Fourth row same as second. Fifth row all X
