Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first row is X □ □ □ X. Then the second row is the same. The third row is all X's. The fourth and fifth rows are the same as the first two. So it looks like the middle row (third) is completely filled with X's, and the top and bottom rows have X's only at the ends with empty cells in between. So maybe it's like a frame with a solid middle line.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1. The first row is all X's. Then the second row is X □ X □ X. Third row all X's again. Fourth row same as second, and fifth all X's. So this grid has horizontal lines on the top, middle, and bottom, but the middle rows (second and fourth) have alternating X and empty cells. So it's like a grid with horizontal stripes but with some empty cells in the middle.\n\nDistractor 2 has the first row all X's. Second row is X followed by four empty cells? Wait, no: the second row is X □ □ □ □. Then third row all X's. Fourth row same as second, and fifth all",
