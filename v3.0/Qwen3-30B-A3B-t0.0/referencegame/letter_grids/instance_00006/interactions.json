Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is:\n\nRow 1: All Xs.\nRow 2: X followed by four □s.\nRow 3: All Xs.\nRow 4: X followed by four □s.\nRow 5: All Xs.\n\nSo, the target has two rows (rows 2 and 4) with a single X at the start and then four empty cells. The rest are all Xs.\n\nNow, Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: All Xs.\nRow 2: X, □, X, □, X.\nRow 3: All Xs.\nRow 4: X, □, X, □, X.\nRow 5: All Xs.\n\nSo, in distractor 1, the second and fourth rows have alternating X and □, starting and ending with X. So, the pattern is X □ X □ X. That's different from the target's X followed by four □s.\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: All Xs.\nRow 2: X followed by four □s (same as target's row 2).\nRow 3: X followed by four □s (but in the target, row 3 is all",
