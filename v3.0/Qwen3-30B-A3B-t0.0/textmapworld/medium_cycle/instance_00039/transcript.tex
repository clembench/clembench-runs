	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example given shows that when you enter a room, you have to decide the direction. The user starts in the Home gym, which has only west as an available direction. So the first step is to go west. Then, after entering the Lobby, the available directions are east and north. Then the example continues with going north, then eventually ending with DONE when there's only south left.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the actual problem here is to figure out the correct sequence of directions to visit all rooms, but the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. Wait, the initial problem statement says "the following task" but the user hasn't given the specific room layout. Wait, looking back, the user provided an example, but the actual task here is to start from the Home gym with available direction west. But without knowing the structure of the rooms, how can I determine the correct path?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe this is part of a
