	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's example shows that when you enter a room, you can choose a direction. The challenge is to figure out the optimal path. However, the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. Wait, the initial problem statement doesn't give a map. So how can I determine the directions? Maybe this is part of the problem, and the user expects me to simulate a possible scenario?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user provided an example where the initial room is the Kitchen with directions south and west. Then the user's answer was to go west, then north, then done. But in the actual problem, the starting point is the Billiard room with directions north and south. So maybe the user is expecting me to generate a sequence of moves that would explore all rooms, but without knowing the actual layout, how can I do that?\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario where the user is testing the ability to generate a
