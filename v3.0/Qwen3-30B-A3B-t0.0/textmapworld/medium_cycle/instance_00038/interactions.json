In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Bar. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room, you check the available directions. The user is in the Bar, and the available direction is west. So the first step is to go west. Then, after entering the Lobby, the directions are east and north. Then they go north, and so on. The example ends when they reach a Bedroom with only south as a direction, and then they do DONE.\n\nSo the key here is to explore all rooms, but once there are no new rooms to visit, you stop. But how do you know when there are no new rooms? Maybe the system is designed so that when you enter a room, you can check the directions, and if all directions lead to rooms you've already visited, then you can stop.\n\nBut the problem is that the user is giving me the initial state: You are in the Bar, available direction is west.
