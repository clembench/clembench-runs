In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Kitchen with directions south and east. So maybe the actual problem is a specific maze or layout that the user has in mind, but it's not provided here. Wait, the user's message is the initial prompt, and the example is just an example. But in the actual task, the user is starting in the Kitchen with directions south and east. But without knowing the full structure of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path?\n\nWait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined, but the user hasn't provided it. However, in the current context, the user is just giving an example of how the interaction should work. So perhaps the actual task is to simulate the process of exploring rooms, and the user is expecting a step-by-step response based on the example.\n\nBut the user's instruction says",
