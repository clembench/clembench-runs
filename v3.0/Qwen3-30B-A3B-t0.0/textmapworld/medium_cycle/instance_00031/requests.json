In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms, like a Hamiltonian path if possible.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Sauna with only a west direction available. So the initial step is to go west. But without knowing the structure of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Maybe the user expects a general approach or perhaps there's an implicit layout they're referring to.\n\nWait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined, but since the user hasn't provided it, I have to assume that the example is the only context. But in the example, the user was in the Kitchen with directions south and west. Then went west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. So maybe the layout is a simple",
