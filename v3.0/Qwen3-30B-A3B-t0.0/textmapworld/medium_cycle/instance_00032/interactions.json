In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room with no new directions, you stop. So the idea is to explore all reachable rooms, and once there are no more new rooms to visit, you stop.\n\nBut how does the direction decision work? Each time you're in a room, you choose a direction. The challenge is to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms without unnecessary backtracking. But since the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms, I need to assume that the available directions are given each time. Wait, the initial prompt says \"You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: east.\" So the user is starting here. The example shows that when you reach a room with no new directions, you say DONE.\n\nBut without knowing the full map, how can I determine the optimal path? Maybe the problem is a generic one where the user is expecting a strategy. But the user's instruction says \"Please help me with the following task\" and then gives an example. But the actual task",
