In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So perhaps the idea is to explore all reachable rooms in the most efficient way.\n\nStarting in the Playroom, available direction is north. So the first step is to go north. Let's assume that going north leads to another room. Then, in that new room, check available directions. The challenge is to make sure that each move is necessary and that we don't backtrack unless needed. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? Since the user hasn't provided a specific map, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I have to simulate a possible path.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't given any specific information about the room layout beyond the starting point. So maybe this is a generic problem where the assistant is supposed to generate a sequence of moves that would explore all rooms, assuming that each move leads to a new room until there are no more. But without knowing the actual structure, it's impossible to know the exact path. However, the",
