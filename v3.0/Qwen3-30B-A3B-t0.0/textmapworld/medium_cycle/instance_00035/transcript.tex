	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example given shows that when you reach a room with no new directions, you say DONE. So the idea is to explore all possible rooms by moving in directions, and once you can't go any further (no new rooms to visit), you stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the initial setup is that you start in the Guest room, which has available directions: north. So the first step is to go north. But how do I know which directions lead to new rooms? The problem is that the user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms. Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the assistant is supposed to simulate the process, but without knowing the actual room layout, how can I determine the directions?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined, but in this case, the user hasn't provided it. But the example given in the problem shows a sequence of steps where each move leads to a
