In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room, you can choose a direction. The user is in the Pantry, with available direction north. So the first step is to go north. Then, depending on where that leads, you proceed. The challenge is to make sure that once all rooms are visited, you can recognize that and stop.\n\nBut how do I know when all rooms are visited? The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit. So maybe the system will tell me when I'm in a room that's already been visited, and then I can decide to stop. But the user's instruction is to stop when there are no new rooms to visit. So perhaps when I'm in a room where all directions lead to rooms I've already been to, then I can say DONE.\n\nBut the initial step is to start in the Pantry, which has only north as a direction. So the",
