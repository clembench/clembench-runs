In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room with only one direction, you do \"DONE\". So the idea is to explore all possible rooms, but once there are no new rooms to visit, you stop.\n\nBut how does the system work? The user is in the Kitchen, with directions north and south. The available directions are the ones you can go from the current room. So the initial step is to choose a direction. The challenge is to find a path that covers all rooms with minimal steps. But since the user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms, I need to assume that the user is expecting a general approach. Wait, but the example given has a specific scenario. However, in the actual problem, the user hasn't provided the room layout. Wait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined, but in this case, the user is just giving an example of how the interaction should be. Wait, the user's message is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the task",
