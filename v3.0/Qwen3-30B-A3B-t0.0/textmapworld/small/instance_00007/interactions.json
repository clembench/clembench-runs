In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the example given shows that once you can't go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible rooms in a way that you don't get stuck before visiting all. But how do I know when there are no new rooms to visit? The user says to recognize when there are no new rooms and decide to stop.\n\nBut the initial problem is that the user is in the Home theater, with available direction west. So the first step is to go west. Then, depending on what's next, proceed. But without knowing the layout of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the user is expecting a general approach, but the actual room layout isn't provided. Hmm, that's confusing. The example given has a Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom, etc., but the current scenario starts in Home theater with west as the only direction. \n\nWait, maybe",
