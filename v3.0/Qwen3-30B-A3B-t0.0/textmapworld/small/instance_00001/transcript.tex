	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room with only one direction, you just go there and then say DONE. So maybe the idea is to explore all rooms in a way that you don't have to backtrack unnecessarily.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's current situation is starting in the Closet, with directions north and south. So the available directions are north and south. The user needs to decide which direction to go first. But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have the map, maybe the problem is a standard one where you have to traverse all rooms in a grid or something. But without more info, maybe the answer is to pick one direction, say north, then proceed until you can't, then backtrack? But the user wants to minimize room changes. Wait, maybe the problem is similar to a depth-first search, where you go as far as possible before backtracking. But the user's instruction is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Wait, maybe "room changes" refers
