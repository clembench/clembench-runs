        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that&#x27;s a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it&#x27;s about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.<br/><br/>But the user&#x27;s example shows that once you can&#x27;t go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible rooms in a way that you don&#x27;t have to retrace steps. But how do I know when there are no new rooms to visit? The user says to recognize when there are no new rooms and then decide to stop.<br/><br/>But the initial prompt says that in each room, you need to decide the direction to go. So the challenge is to figure out the optimal path. However, the user hasn&#x27;t provided a specific map or layout of the rooms. That&#x27;s a problem. Without knowing the structure of the rooms, how can I determine the directions?<br/><br/>Wait, the example given starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then stops. But in the current scenario, the user is starting in the Bedroom with only an east direction available. So maybe the rooms</p>
