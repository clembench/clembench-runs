In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about minimizing the number of times you have to change direction? Or perhaps it's about visiting all rooms with as few steps as possible?\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room with no new directions, you say DONE. So the task is to explore all reachable rooms, and once there are no more new rooms to visit, stop. The challenge is to do this with the least number of moves. But how?\n\nThe user starts in the Media room, which has only east as a direction. So the first step is to go east. Then, depending on what's next, you proceed. But since the user hasn't provided the actual room layout, I need to assume that each room's available directions are given as part of the input. However, in the actual scenario, the user would be providing the directions step by step. But since this is a simulation, maybe the assistant is supposed to generate a sequence that would explore all rooms optimally.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the actual map.
