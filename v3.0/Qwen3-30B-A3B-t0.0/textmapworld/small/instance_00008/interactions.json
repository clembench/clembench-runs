In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So perhaps the idea is to explore all reachable rooms in a way that doesn't require backtracking, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe user is starting in the Closet, with directions west and east. So the available directions are west and east. The task is to decide the next direction. But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, maybe the approach is to pick one direction, explore as much as possible, then backtrack if needed. But since the user wants the fewest room changes, maybe it's about not revisiting rooms. But without knowing the layout, how can I decide?\n\nWait, the problem says \"recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point.\" So the challenge is to explore all rooms, but once you can't find any new rooms, you stop.
