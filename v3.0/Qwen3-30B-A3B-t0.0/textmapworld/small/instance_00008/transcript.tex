	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So perhaps the idea is to explore all reachable rooms in a way that doesn't require backtracking, but I'm not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user is starting in the Closet, with directions west and east. So the available directions are west and east. The task is to decide the next direction. But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, maybe the approach is to pick one direction, explore as much as possible, then backtrack if needed. But since the user wants the fewest room changes, maybe it's about not revisiting rooms. But without knowing the layout, how can I decide?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem says "recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point." So the challenge is to explore all rooms, but once you can't find any new rooms, you stop. But how to do that without a map? Maybe the user is expecting a
