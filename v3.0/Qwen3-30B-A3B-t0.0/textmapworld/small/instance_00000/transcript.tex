	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Studio. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example given shows that when you enter a room, you check the available directions. The user is in the Studio, which has only west as a direction. So the first step is to go west. Then, in the Lobby, directions are east and north. Then they go north, and so on. The example ends when they reach a Bedroom with only south as a direction, and then they do DONE.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the key is to explore all rooms, but once there are no new rooms to visit, you stop. But how do you know when there are no new rooms? The problem says that in each room, you need to decide the direction to go. But how do you track which rooms you've already visited? The user probably has a map or some way to track visited rooms, but the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the assumption is that when you enter a room, you can check the directions, and
