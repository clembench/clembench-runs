In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room, you check the available directions. The user is in the Guest room, with only west available. So the first step is to go west. Then, after entering the Lobby, directions are east and north. Then they go north, and so on until they reach a room with no new directions, then say DONE.\n\nSo the challenge is to figure out the optimal path. But since the user hasn't provided the actual layout of the rooms, how can I determine the directions? Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the user expects a general approach. But the initial prompt says \"the following task\" but doesn't provide the room layout. That's confusing. Wait, looking back, the user provided an example, but the actual problem here is that the user is starting in the Guest room with only west available. So maybe this is part of a larger problem where the user",
