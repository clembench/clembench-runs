	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Nursery. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or perhaps it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So maybe the task is to explore all reachable rooms, and once there are no new rooms to visit, stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's instruction says "visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible." So perhaps the strategy is to find a path that covers all rooms with the least number of moves. But how does that work? If the rooms are connected in a way that requires backtracking, maybe the optimal path is a depth-first search or something similar. But since the user is giving directions step by step, I need to simulate that.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the initial scenario is: You are in the Nursery. Available directions: south. So the first move is to go south. Then, after entering the next room, the available directions would be given. But since I don't have the actual map, I need to assume that each room has certain directions. However, the user hasn't provided the actual layout. Wait, maybe this is part
