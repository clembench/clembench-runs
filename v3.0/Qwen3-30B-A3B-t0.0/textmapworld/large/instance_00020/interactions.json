In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means they want to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible, or perhaps it's about minimizing the number of times they have to change direction? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms without backtracking too much?\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room, you choose a direction, and when there are no new rooms to visit, you say DONE. So the task is to explore all rooms, and once there are no more unvisited rooms, stop.\n\nBut how does the user know when there are no new rooms? The problem says that in each room, you need to decide the direction to go. So maybe the user is supposed to navigate through the rooms, and when they reach a point where all adjacent rooms have been visited, they can stop.\n\nBut the initial setup is that you start in the Cellar, with available direction east. So the first step is to go east. Then, depending on what's next, proceed.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the actual layout of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Wait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined,",
