In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user's example shows that when you enter a room, you have to decide the direction. The example starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. But in that case, the user stopped after entering the Bedroom, which had only one direction (south). So maybe the idea is that once you can't go any further without revisiting rooms, you stop.\n\nBut the current scenario is that the user is in the Bedroom, with directions west and east. So the available directions are west and east. The user needs to decide which direction to go next. The challenge is to make sure that all rooms are visited with minimal moves. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? Since the user hasn't provided a map, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the assistant has to simulate the process.\n\nWait, but the user is expecting me to generate the next step",
