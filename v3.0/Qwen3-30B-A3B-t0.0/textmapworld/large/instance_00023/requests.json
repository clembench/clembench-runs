In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few changes as possible, like not backtracking?\n\nBut the example given shows that once you can't go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all rooms in a way that you don't have to retrace steps. But how do I know when there are no new rooms to visit? The user says to recognize when there are no new rooms and decide to stop.\n\nBut the initial problem is that the user is in the Media room, with available direction north. So the first step is to go north. But how do I know if that's the right direction? Since the user hasn't provided the map, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where I have to assume that going north leads to a new room, and then proceed from there.\n\nWait, but the user is expecting me to generate the correct sequence of moves. However, without knowing the actual layout of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Maybe this is part of a larger problem where the user is simulating a maze or a grid, and each step provides feedback",
