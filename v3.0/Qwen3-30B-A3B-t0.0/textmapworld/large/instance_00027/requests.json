In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living room with directions west and east. So I need to figure out the optimal path here. But without knowing the room layout, how can I decide? Wait, maybe this is part of a larger problem where the room layout is predefined, but the user hasn't provided it. Hmm, that's confusing. \n\nWait, maybe the user is expecting me to simulate a possible path. But without knowing the structure, I can't know which direction leads to new rooms. The example shows that when you reach a room with only one direction, you stop. So perhaps the idea is to explore in a way that when you can't go further without revisiting rooms, you stop. But how to",
