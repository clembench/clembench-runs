In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So perhaps the task is to explore all reachable rooms, and once there are no new rooms to visit, stop.\n\nBut the user's instruction says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So maybe the strategy is to find a path that covers all rooms with the least number of moves. But how does that work? If there are multiple rooms, maybe it's about finding an optimal path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut given the example, the user is in the Recreation room with only east as a direction. So the first step is to go east. Then, depending on what's next, proceed. But since the user hasn't provided the actual room layout, I need to assume that the user is expecting a general approach. However, the user's message seems to be a simulation where each step is given, and the assistant has to respond with GO or DONE.\n\nWait, the user provided an example",
