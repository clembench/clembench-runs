In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Attic. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the example given shows that when you enter a room, you can choose a direction. The user is in the Attic, and the available direction is west. So the first step is to go west. Then, after entering the Lobby, the available directions are east and north. Then the next step is to go north. Then in the Bedroom, only south is available, and then they decide to stop with DONE.\n\nWait, but how do they know when they're done? The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit. So the algorithm must be to explore all possible rooms, but once you can't go any further without revisiting rooms, you stop.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a depth-first search or breadth-first search problem, where you explore all possible paths, but the user is supposed to give the directions step by step.
