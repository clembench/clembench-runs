	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Pantry with directions north and south. So I need to figure out the optimal path here. However, without knowing the room layout, how can I determine the best direction?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe the problem is a generic one where the user is expecting a standard approach. But since the actual room connections aren't provided, perhaps the answer is to just go in one direction, then when there's no new rooms, stop. But how to know when there are no new rooms? The user mentioned that once there are no new rooms to visit, we should decide to stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt But in the example, the user was in the Kitchen with directions south and west. They went west, then north, then
