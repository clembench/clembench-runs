	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. The aim is to visit all rooms with as few changes as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's example shows that once there are no new rooms to visit, you should stop. So the challenge is to explore all rooms, but when you can't go further without revisiting, you stop. But how do I know when there are no new rooms? The user is probably simulating a maze or a grid where each room has certain directions. The initial position is the Craft room, with available directions north and west. So the first step is to choose between those two.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the problem is that without knowing the layout of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Wait, maybe this is a standard problem, like a maze where you have to traverse all rooms with minimal steps. But since the user hasn't provided the actual map, perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario where the assistant is supposed to simulate the process, assuming that each direction leads to a new room until there are none left.
