In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user's example shows that once you can't go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible rooms in a way that you don't get stuck before visiting all. But how do I know which direction to take first? The initial position is the Laundry room, with directions north, south, west. So the available directions are those three. The user's example had a similar setup, and the assistant chose west, then north, then done. But in that example, maybe the path was a straight line, and once they reached a dead end, they stopped.\n\nBut in this case, the user is starting in the Laundry room. The available directions are north, south, west. So the first step is to choose one of those. But how to decide which direction to go first to minimize the number of room changes?
