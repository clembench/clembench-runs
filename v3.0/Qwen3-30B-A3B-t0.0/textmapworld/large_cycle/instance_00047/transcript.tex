	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe that means the fewest number of moves? Or the fewest number of times you have to change direction? Or perhaps it's about visiting all rooms with the least number of steps? The example given shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So maybe the task is to explore all reachable rooms, and once there are no new rooms to visit, stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user's instruction says "visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible." So maybe the idea is to find a path that covers all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? If there are multiple rooms, you need to traverse them in a way that you don't retrace steps unnecessarily.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example starts in the Game room with available direction east. So maybe this is a maze or a grid where each room has certain directions. But without knowing the structure, how can I determine the optimal path?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the user is expecting a general approach. But the example shows that when you reach a room with no new directions,
