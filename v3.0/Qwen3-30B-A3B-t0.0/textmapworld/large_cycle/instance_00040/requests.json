In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to find the optimal path that covers all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does the user know when they're done? They need to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit.\n\nThe example shows that when you enter a room with no new directions, you can stop. So the strategy would be to explore all possible rooms, but once you've checked all directions and there's nowhere new to go, you can end the process.\n\nStarting in the Utility room with directions north, south, east, west. So four options. The challenge is to choose the order of directions that allows covering all rooms without backtracking unnecessarily. But since the user doesn't have a map, they have to explore step by step.\n\nBut how to decide the next direction? Since the user is to give the next instruction, the assistant needs to simulate the exploration. However, without knowing the actual layout of the rooms, the assistant might have to assume a certain structure. But maybe the problem is more about the algorithm than the specific room layout.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that when you enter a room, you check",
