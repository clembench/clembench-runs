In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Recreation room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nThe user is starting in the Recreation room, with directions south and west. So the first step is to choose between those two. But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, maybe I need to assume that each direction leads to a new room. But the challenge is to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit. So the strategy would be to explore each direction, but once you hit a dead end or a room you've already been to, you need to backtrack. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, maybe a depth-first search approach would be better, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. However, without knowing the layout, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the example given shows that when you enter a room with only one direction, you go that way, and then when there's no new rooms, you say DONE. So the key is to keep moving",
