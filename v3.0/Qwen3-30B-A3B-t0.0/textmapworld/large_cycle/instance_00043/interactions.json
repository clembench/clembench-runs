In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room with only one direction, you just go there and then say DONE. So maybe the idea is to explore all rooms in a way that you don't have to backtrack unnecessarily.\n\nBut the user's initial instruction is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So perhaps the strategy is to find a path that covers all rooms without revisiting, but since the example ends when there are no new rooms, maybe the approach is to explore in a way that when you can't go further, you stop.\n\nBut the current scenario is: You are in the Dining room. Available direction is west. So the next step is to go west. Then, after entering the next room, you check the directions again. The example shows that when you reach a room with only one direction, you go there and then say DONE. So maybe the process is to keep moving in the available directions until you can't go further, then stop.\n\nBut the problem is that without knowing the layout of the",
