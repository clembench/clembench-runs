In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms, like a Hamiltonian path if possible.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Media room with directions north and south. So maybe the actual problem is a specific maze or layout that the user has in mind, but it's not provided here. Wait, the user is giving an example of how the interaction should go, but the actual task is to simulate that. However, in the current query, the user is starting the interaction, and the initial position is the Media room with directions north and south.\n\nBut without knowing the full structure of the rooms, how can I determine the optimal path? Maybe this is part of a larger problem where the user expects me to simulate the process, assuming that the rooms are connected in a certain way. But since the user hasn't provided the room layout, perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to generate a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the",
