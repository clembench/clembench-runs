	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example given shows that when you enter a room, you can choose a direction. The user is in the Dining room, available direction is north. So the first step is to go north. Then, after moving, the next room's directions are given. The challenge is to figure out the optimal path.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the user hasn't provided the actual layout of the rooms, how can I determine the directions? Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the assistant is supposed to simulate the process. But without knowing the room layout, how can I know which directions are valid? Hmm, maybe the user is expecting a general approach or a specific sequence based on some standard setup. But the initial prompt says "the following task" but doesn't provide the room structure. That's confusing.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, looking back at the user's message: they provided an example where the user is in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby
