In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room with only one direction, you just go there and then say DONE. So the idea is to explore all rooms, but once there are no new rooms to visit, you stop.\n\nBut how does the user's current situation look? They start in the Closet, with directions south and west. So the available directions are south and west. The user needs to decide which direction to go first. The challenge is to find a path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much. But since the user hasn't provided the map structure, I need to assume a possible layout. Wait, but maybe the problem is a generic one, and the user expects a standard approach.\n\nWait, the example given has a Kitchen, then Lobby, then Bedroom. So maybe the rooms are connected in a grid or some structure. But without knowing the actual layout, how can I determine the optimal path? This seems impossible.
