	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example given shows that when you enter a room, you have to decide the direction. The user is in the Sauna, and the available direction is east. So the first step is to go east. Then, after moving, the next room's directions are given. The challenge is to figure out the optimal path.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the user hasn't provided the actual layout of the rooms, how can I determine the directions? Wait, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where the assistant is supposed to simulate the process. But without knowing the room layout, how can I know which directions to take? Hmm, maybe the user expects a general approach or a specific sequence based on some standard setup. But the example given starts in the Sauna with east as the only direction. So perhaps the rooms are connected in a specific way that the user is expecting me to know, or maybe it's a test case.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's
