In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided the specific layout of the rooms. The example given starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Wine cellar with directions west and east. So I need to figure out the optimal path here.\n\nWait, but without knowing the room layout, how can I determine the best directions? Maybe the problem assumes a specific layout that's standard, or perhaps it's a hypothetical scenario where the user expects a general approach. But the example given has a specific path. Maybe the user is expecting me to simulate a possible path, assuming that each direction leads to a new room, and once you can't go further, you stop.\n\nBut the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So the challenge is to find a path that covers all rooms with minimal steps.",
