In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?",

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms, but do it in such a way that the number of moves (room changes) is as small as possible.\n\nBut how does the user know when they're done? They need to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit. So the strategy would be to explore all possible rooms, but without backtracking unnecessarily. But since the user is starting in the Utility room, which has directions south and east. Let me think about the example given. In the example, the user started in the Kitchen, went west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and then done because there was only south left. So the idea is that once you can't go any direction that leads to a new room, you stop.\n\nBut how to model this? The user is probably in a maze-like structure where each room has certain directions. The challenge is to traverse all rooms with minimal moves. But without knowing the layout, how can I determine the optimal path? Wait, maybe the user is expecting a general approach, but the actual problem might be a specific setup. However, the",
