	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe that means the minimal number of moves between rooms? Or maybe it's about visiting all rooms with as few transitions as possible. But the example shows that when you enter a room, you have to decide the direction. The key is to make sure you don't miss any rooms and stop when there are no new rooms to visit.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Billiard room with directions south, west, east. So three options. The challenge is to figure out the optimal path. But since I don't have a map, I need to think of a strategy. Maybe a depth-first search approach? Or a systematic way to cover all directions. But without knowing the layout, it's tricky. However, the user might be expecting a standard approach.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example shows that when you reach a room with no new directions, you say DONE. So the idea is to explore all possible rooms, but once you can't go further without revisiting, you stop. But how to ensure all rooms are visited? Maybe the user is simulating a maze where each room has certain exits, and you need to traverse all of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since I don't have the actual
