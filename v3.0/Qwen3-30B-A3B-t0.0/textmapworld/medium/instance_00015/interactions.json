In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times they have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user's example shows that once you can't go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible rooms in a way that you don't have to retrace steps. But how do I know which direction to take first? The initial position is the Sauna, with directions south and east available. So the user has to choose between going south or east. But which one leads to fewer room changes overall?\n\nWait, the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So the challenge is to find the path that covers all rooms with the least number of moves. But without knowing the layout of the rooms, how can I determine that? Maybe the user is expecting a specific path based on some standard layout, but since the example is given, perhaps there's a standard structure here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a variation of a graph traversal where each room is a",
