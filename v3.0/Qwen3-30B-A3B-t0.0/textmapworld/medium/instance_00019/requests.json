In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user wants to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So the goal is to explore every room possible, but minimize the number of times you have to switch rooms. Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the problem is about moving through rooms, and each time you move, that's a room change. So the task is to visit all rooms with as few moves as possible. But how does that work? Maybe it's about finding the most efficient path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nBut the user's example shows that once you can't go further, you stop. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible rooms in a way that you don't get stuck before visiting all. But how do I know when there are no new rooms to visit? The user says to recognize when there are no new rooms and then decide to stop.\n\nBut the initial problem is that the user is in the Nursery with directions west and east. So the first step is to choose between west or east. But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, maybe the approach is to pick one direction, explore as much as possible, then backtrack if needed. But since the user wants the fewest room changes, maybe a depth-first search approach would be better, but I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms.\n\nWait, but without knowing the layout, how can I decide?",
