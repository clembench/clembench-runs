        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Attic. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Attic, and the only available direction is west. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.<br/><br/>First, the initial step is to go west from the Attic. That makes sense because there&#x27;s no other option. When they go west, they&#x27;ll enter another room. Let&#x27;s assume that room is the Library, based on the example given earlier. Wait, in the example, the first move was west from the Living Room to the Library. But here, the starting point is the Attic. Maybe the map is different. But since the user hasn&#x27;t provided specific details about the rooms, I have to rely on the example structure.<br/><br/>So, the first action is to go west. The graph should include the Attic as a node. Then, when moving west, the next room (let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a room called &quot;Room1&quot;) is added. The edges would connect Attic to Room1 via west. But since the user hasn&#x27;t specified the names of the rooms, maybe I should just use placeholders or the directions as per the example. Wait, in the example, the nodes were named like &quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, etc. But in the problem statement, the user hasn&#x27;t given specific room names. Hmm, maybe the actual room names aren&#x27;t important, and the graph just needs to track the connections</p>
