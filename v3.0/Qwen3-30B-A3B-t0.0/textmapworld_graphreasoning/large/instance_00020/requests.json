In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go east from the Cellar. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they go east, they'll enter a new room. Let's assume that room is the Kitchen, but the actual name isn't specified. The key is to track the graph as they move.\n\nThe graph needs to have nodes for each room visited and edges for the directions taken. So, the first node is \"Cellar\". When moving east, the edge from Cellar to the next room (let's say Kitchen) should be added. But since the user hasn't entered the next room yet, maybe the edge is just recorded as part of the graph.\n\nWait, in the example given, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edges for west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So, the edges are stored as lists of tuples. So, when moving east from Cellar, the edge \"east\" would have a tuple of (Cellar, next_room). But the next room's name isn't known yet. Hmm, but the user's response would be to go east, and then the system would respond with the next room's details. However, in this case, the user",
