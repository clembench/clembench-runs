In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

The user is in the Recreation room, and the only available direction is east. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to proceed.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go east from the Recreation room. The graph should start with the Recreation room as a node. Since there's only one direction, east, I'll go that way. But I don't know what's beyond that. The example shows that each time you move, you add the new room to the nodes and record the edge. \n\nSo the first action is to go east. The graph will have \"Recreation room\" as a node, and the edges for east will have a connection from Recreation room to whatever room is next. But since we haven't entered that room yet, maybe the edges are updated once we move. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edges.west had (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). Then when they went north to Kitchen, edges.north had (\"Library\", \"Kitchen\"). So each time you move, you add the edge in the direction you went. \n\nSo in this case, the first move is east. The graph should have \"Recreation room\" as a node. The edges for east would be a list that includes the connection from Recreation room to the next room.
