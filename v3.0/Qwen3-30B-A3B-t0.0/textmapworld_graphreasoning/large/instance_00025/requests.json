In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each move to a new room adds to the graph. The example shows that when you go west from the Living Room, the graph updates with the new node and edge. So, the initial step is to choose either north or south. But how do I decide which one to pick to minimize the number of changes?\n\nSince the problem is about visiting all rooms with the least number of changes, maybe it's a graph traversal problem where we need to find an optimal path. But since the user hasn't provided the actual map, I have to assume that each direction leads to a new room. However, the user might be expecting a strategy here.\n\nWait, the user hasn't given the actual layout of the rooms. So maybe the answer is to start by going in one direction, say north, and then proceed. But how can I know if that's the best choice? Since the problem is to minimize room changes, perhaps the user is expecting a depth-first search approach or something similar.\n\nBut without knowing the actual connections, I have to make an assumption. The example shows that each time a direction is chosen, the graph is updated. So the first step is to pick a direction. Let's say north. Then, when",
