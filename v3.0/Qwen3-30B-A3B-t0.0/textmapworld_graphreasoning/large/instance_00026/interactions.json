In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen.

So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go south from the Nursery. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they go south, they'll enter another room. Let's assume that room is connected via the south direction from the Nursery. The graph needs to be updated with the new node and the edge between Nursery and the next room.\n\nBut wait, the example shows that when moving, the edges are added as tuples. So, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge has a tuple of (Living Room, Library). Similarly, moving north from Library to Kitchen adds a north edge with (Library, Kitchen). So, each movement adds an edge in the direction taken.\n\nSo, the first action is to go south. The graph should have the Nursery as a node, and the south edge would have the next room. But since we don't know the next room's name yet, maybe the graph is built as we go. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edges.west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the edge is stored as a list of tuples, each tuple being the pair of rooms connected in that direction.\n\nSo, when moving south from",
