In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go west from the Bar. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they go west, they'll enter another room. Let's assume that room is the Library, based on the example given earlier. Wait, in the example, going west from the Living Room led to the Library. But here, starting from the Bar, going west would lead to a new room. Let me think.\n\nThe graph needs to be built as they explore. Each time they move, the graph should update with the new node and the edge. So, the first move is \"GO: west\". The graph will have \"Bar\" as the first node. Then, when they go west, the next room (let's say it's the Library) is added. The edges would have west from Bar to Library. But the example shows that the edges are stored as lists of tuples. So, the edges for west would include (\"Bar\", \"Library\").\n\nBut wait, the user hasn't provided the actual map, so I have to simulate the exploration. The key is to keep track of visited rooms and ensure that each move is to an unvisited room. However, since the user hasn't given the actual layout",
