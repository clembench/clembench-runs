        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Media room and can only go north. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best direction to go first.<br/><br/>Since there&#x27;s only one direction available, north, that&#x27;s the obvious choice. But I should check if there&#x27;s any hidden information. The example shows that each time you move, the graph updates. So, the initial step is to go north. The graph should include the Media room and the next room. But since the next room&#x27;s name isn&#x27;t given, maybe I just add the direction. Wait, the example had the edges as tuples of room names. But in the first example, the edges for west had [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]. So, when moving from Media to North, the edge would be added as (&quot;Media room&quot;, &quot;next room&quot;). But since the next room&#x27;s name isn&#x27;t provided, maybe I just note the direction. Wait, the user hasn&#x27;t entered the next room yet. So the graph should have the Media room as a node, and the edge for north would be added once the move is made. But in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edge west had that tuple. So maybe when moving north from Media, the edge north would have (&quot;Media room&quot;, &quot;next room&quot;), but since we don&#x27;t know the next room&#x27;s name yet, perhaps it&#x27;s just</p>
