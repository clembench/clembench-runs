In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

The graph should include the Media room and the next room. But since the next room's name isn't given, maybe I just add the direction. Wait, the example had the edges as tuples of room names. But in the first example, the edges for west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So, when moving from Media to North, the edge would be added as (\"Media room\", \"next room\"). But since the next room's name isn't provided, maybe I just note the direction. Wait, the user hasn't entered the next room yet. So the graph should have the Media room as a node, and the edge for north would be added once the move is made.
