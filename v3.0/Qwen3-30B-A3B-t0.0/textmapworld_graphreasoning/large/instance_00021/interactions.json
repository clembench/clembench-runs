In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\": \"DONE\", \"graph\": {...}}\nLet us start.\nYou are in the Gallery. Currently available directions: east.

So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go east from the Gallery. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they enter the next room, they'll have new directions to explore. But how do I track the graph? The example shows that each time a new room is entered, it's added to the nodes, and the edges are updated based on the direction taken.\n\nSo, the first action is to go east. The graph should have the Gallery as a node, and the edge from Gallery to the next room (let's say Room A) via east. But since the next room's name isn't given, maybe I just need to represent the connection without the room name? Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edge west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So maybe the edges are stored as tuples of the rooms connected in that direction.\n\nBut the problem is, the user hasn't provided the names of the rooms beyond the Gallery. So maybe the graph is built incrementally as the user moves. Each time a new room is entered, it's added to the nodes, and the edges are updated based on the direction taken.\n\nSo the first step is to go east.",
