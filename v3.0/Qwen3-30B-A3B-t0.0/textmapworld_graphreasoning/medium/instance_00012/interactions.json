In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

So I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each move adds to the graph. The initial graph has the Billiard room. When moving, I need to add the new room and connect the edges. The challenge is to explore all rooms without backtracking too much. But since the user hasn't provided the actual map, I have to assume that each direction leads to a new room. However, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms. But since I don't have the actual data, I have to simulate based on the example.\n\nIn the example, each time a direction is chosen, the graph is updated. So the first step is to pick a direction. Let's say I choose west. Then the graph would have Billiard room connected to the next room via west. But maybe the user wants to explore all possible directions. However, the task is to minimize room changes, so maybe a depth-first approach? But without knowing the map, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the user's example shows that each time a direction is taken, the graph is updated. So the first move from Billiard room could be any of the three directions. But which one? Since the user hasn't provided the actual layout, perhaps the answer is",
