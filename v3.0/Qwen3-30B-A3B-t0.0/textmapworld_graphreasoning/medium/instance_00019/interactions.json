In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

The current room is the Nursery, and the available directions are west and east. \n\nFirst, I need to decide which direction to go. Since the problem is about minimizing room changes, maybe I should pick one direction first. But how do I know which one? Well, maybe it's arbitrary, but perhaps there's a strategy here. Since the user hasn't provided any prior information about the map, I have to assume that each direction could lead to a new room. \n\nThe example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new node and the edge. So, the first step is to go either west or east. Let's pick west first. That would mean the next room is connected to the Nursery via west. But since I don't know what's there, I have to make a choice. \n\nWait, but the user wants the fewest number of room changes. So maybe a depth-first search approach would be better, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. But since the user is asking for the minimal number of steps, perhaps the optimal path would be to explore each room once. However, without knowing the map structure, I can't plan ahead. \n\nIn the example, the user went west first, then north, then east. So maybe the initial step",
