In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is in the Sauna with available directions south and east. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each move adds to the graph. The initial graph has the Sauna as a node. When moving south or east, I need to check which direction leads to a new room. But since I don't have prior information, maybe I should pick one and then proceed. But how to minimize changes? Maybe explore one path fully before backtracking. But since the user hasn't provided the map yet, I have to make assumptions.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with edges. So each time I go a direction, the edge is added. The user's task is to build the graph as they explore. The challenge is to visit all rooms with minimal changes. But without knowing the layout, I have to make a choice. \n\nIn the first step, the Sauna has south and east. Let's pick one. Maybe east first. So the action would be \"GO: east\". Then the graph would have Sauna and the next room, with an edge east. But I don't know what's in that direction. Alternatively, maybe south. But how to decide? Since the user wants the fewest room changes, perhaps a depth-first approach would be better, exploring as far",
