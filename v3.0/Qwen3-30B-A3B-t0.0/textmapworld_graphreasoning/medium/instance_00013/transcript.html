        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Wine cellar. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Wine cellar with directions west and east. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best way to explore.<br/><br/>First, I should start by going in one direction. Let&#x27;s pick west. So the first action is &quot;GO: west&quot;. The graph should include the Wine cellar as a node. The edges for west would have the connection from Wine cellar to whatever room is there. But since I don&#x27;t know the next room yet, maybe the edges are empty except for the direction taken. Wait, the example shows that when you go west from Living Room to Library, the edges west has [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]. So maybe when I go west from Wine cellar, the edges.west would have (&quot;Wine cellar&quot;, &quot;next room&quot;). But since the next room isn&#x27;t known yet, maybe the graph is built as we go.<br/><br/>Wait, the initial graph in the example had nodes as [&quot;Living Room&quot;] and edges with empty lists. Then after going west, the nodes added &quot;Library&quot; and the edges.west had the connection. So in this case, when the user is in the Wine cellar, the initial graph has nodes [&quot;Wine cellar&quot;], and edges are all empty. Then when they go west, the edges.west would have (&quot;Wine cellar&quot;, &quot;next room&quot;), but since we don&#x27;t know the next room&#x27;s name yet,</p>
