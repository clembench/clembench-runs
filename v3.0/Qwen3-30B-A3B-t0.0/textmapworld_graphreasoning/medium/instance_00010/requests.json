In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, I should start by moving in one direction. Let's pick north. The graph needs to be updated with the new room. So the action would be \"GO: north\". The nodes would include \"Media room\" and the next room, say \"Room A\". The edges would have north from Media room to Room A. But wait, the example shows that when you move west from Living Room to Library, the edges for west include that connection. So maybe the edges are stored as lists of tuples. But in the example, the edges were represented as lists, but the initial example had edges as empty lists. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the first step, the graph was {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}. Then after moving west to Library, the edges for west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the edges are stored as lists of tuples, with the direction as the key. So when moving north from Media room, the edges[\"north\"] would have a tuple of (Media room, next room). But the next room's name isn't known yet.
