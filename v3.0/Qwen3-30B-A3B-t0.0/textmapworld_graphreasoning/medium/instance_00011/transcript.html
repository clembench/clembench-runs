        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Dining room with only north as a direction. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, first, I need to figure out the optimal path.<br/><br/>Starting in the Dining room, the only available direction is north. So the first move should be to go north. That makes sense. The graph needs to be updated with the Dining room as a node and the edge from Dining room to the next room (which is probably the North room, but we don&#x27;t know the name yet). Wait, but the example shows that when you move, the graph&#x27;s edges are updated with the path taken. So when moving north from Dining room, the edge &quot;north&quot; would have a connection between Dining room and the new room. But since the new room&#x27;s name isn&#x27;t given, maybe we just note the direction. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edges.west had [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]. So the edges are stored as tuples of the rooms in the direction. But in the initial step, the user is in the Dining room, and moving north. So the graph should have nodes [&quot;Dining room&quot;], and edges.north would have the connection once we move. But when you first move, the new room&#x27;s name isn&#x27;t known. Wait, but in the example, when they went west from Living Room, the graph&#x27;s edges.w</p>
