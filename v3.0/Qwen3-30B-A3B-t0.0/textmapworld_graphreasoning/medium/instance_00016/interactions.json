In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

So, I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nSince there's only one direction available, south, that's the only option. The next step is to move south. But I also need to build the graph as we go. The initial graph should have the Laundry room as a node. The edges for south would be from Laundry room to whatever room is south. But since we haven't entered that room yet, maybe the edges are just the connections as we discover them.\n\nWait, the example shows that when you move west from Living Room to Library, the edges for west include that connection. So, each time we move, we add the edge from the current room to the new one in the direction we went. So, in the first step, moving south from Laundry room. The graph should have nodes [\"Laundry room\"], and the edges for south would have a connection from Laundry room to the next room. But since we haven't entered the next room yet, maybe the edges are updated once we move. Wait, in the example, when they went west to Library, the edges.west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So maybe the edges are stored as tuples of (from, to) pairs. So when moving south from Laundry, the edges.south would have (\"La",
