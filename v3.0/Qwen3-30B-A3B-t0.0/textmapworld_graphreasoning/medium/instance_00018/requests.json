In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the next move.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go east from the Sauna. But I need to make sure that each action updates the graph correctly. The graph should track all the rooms visited and the connections between them. \n\nIn the example provided, when moving from the Living Room to the Library west, the edges for west include the tuple (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). Similarly, moving north from the Library to the Kitchen adds (\"Library\", \"Kitchen\") to the north edges. So, each movement adds a connection in the respective direction.\n\nSince the Sauna is the starting point, the initial graph has \"Sauna\" as the only node. The available direction is east, so the next action should be to go east. The edge for east should connect Sauna to the next room. But wait, what's the name of the next room? The problem doesn't specify, but maybe the user is expected to assume that moving east from Sauna leads to a new room, say \"Room1\". However, the example didn't name the rooms beyond the initial ones. Wait, in the example, the first move was from Living Room to Library, then to Kitchen, then to Bedroom. So the rooms have names.
