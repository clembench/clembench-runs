In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

So, I need to figure out the best direction to go next.\n\nFirst, the current room is Media. The available direction is east. So the next step should be to go east. But I need to make sure that this is part of a path that covers all rooms efficiently. Since there's no information about other rooms yet, moving east is the only option. \n\nThe graph needs to be updated. The nodes should include \"Media room\" and the next room, which we don't know yet. The edges should show the connection from Media to the next room via east. But since the next room's name isn't given, maybe I just note the direction. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the edges for west had (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So maybe here, when moving east from Media, the edges for east would have (\"Media room\", \"next room\"). But since the next room's name isn't known, perhaps the graph is built as we go. \n\nWait, the user's example shows that when they went west from Living Room, the edges.west had [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the edges are stored as tuples of the rooms connected. So when moving east from Media, the edges.east would have (\"Media room",
