        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Bedroom, and the only available direction is east. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the next move.<br/><br/>First, the current room is Bedroom. The direction available is east. So, the next step should be to go east. But I need to make sure that this action is correct. Since the user hasn&#x27;t explored any other rooms yet, moving east would lead to a new room. The graph needs to be updated with the new node and the edge connecting Bedroom to the next room. <br/><br/>Wait, but the example shows that when you move, the graph is updated with the new node and the edge. So, in the first step, the user is in Bedroom. The available direction is east. So, the action would be &quot;GO: east&quot;. The graph should have &quot;Bedroom&quot; as a node, and the edges would have &quot;east&quot; pointing to the next room. But since the next room isn&#x27;t known yet, maybe the edge is added as a connection from Bedroom to the new room. However, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge &quot;west&quot; has the pair (&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;). So, in this case, moving east from Bedroom would add an edge in the &quot;east&quot; direction with the Bedroom and the new room. But since the new room&#x27;s name isn&#x27;t given, maybe the</p>
