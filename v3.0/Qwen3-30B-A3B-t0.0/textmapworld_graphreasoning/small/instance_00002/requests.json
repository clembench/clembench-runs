In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\n\nFirst, the initial step is to go north from the Pantry. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they go north, they'll enter another room. Let's assume that room is the Kitchen, but the actual name isn't specified. But the key is to track the graph as they move.\n\nThe graph needs to have nodes for each room visited and edges for the directions taken. So, the Pantry is the first node. When moving north, the edge from Pantry to the next room (let's say Kitchen) should be added to the 'north' list in the edges. But since the user hasn't specified the next room's name, maybe I should just represent it as a placeholder? Wait, no. The example shows that when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added as [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So, the edges are stored as tuples of the rooms connected.\n\nBut in the initial step, the user is in the Pantry. The available direction is north. So, the first action is to go north. The graph should have the Pantry as a node, and the edges for north would include the next room once it's discovered. But since the next",
