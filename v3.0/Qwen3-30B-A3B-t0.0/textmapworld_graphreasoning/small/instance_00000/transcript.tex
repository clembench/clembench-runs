	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Studio. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in the Studio, and the only available direction is west. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best way to explore.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the initial step is to go west from the Studio. That makes sense because there's no other option. When they go west, they'll enter another room. Let's assume that room is connected via a west direction from the Studio. But since the user hasn't mentioned any other rooms yet, the graph should start with the Studio and then add the next room once they move.\\ \tt \\ \tt The example shows that each time a new room is entered, the graph is updated with the new node and the edge. So, when the user moves west, the next room (let's say it's a Hallway) would be added to the nodes, and the west edge from Studio to Hallway would be recorded.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit. So, after moving west, the next step would be to check the available directions in the new room. If there are directions, the user should continue exploring. But how do we know when to stop? The user needs to keep moving until all rooms are visited. However, without knowing the entire map structure, the algorithm should probably use a depth-first approach to explore as far as possible before backtracking, but since the user is to minimize room changes
