In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

The user is in the Closet, and the available directions are west and east. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each move to a new room adds to the graph. The initial room is the Closet. The user can go west or east. Since the problem is about minimizing the number of room changes, maybe I should explore one direction first, then backtrack if needed. But how do I know which direction leads to new rooms?\n\nWait, the user doesn't have any prior information except the current room and available directions. So, the first step is to choose a direction. Let's say I pick west. Then, when entering the next room, I'll check the available directions there. But since I don't know what's beyond, maybe I should go in one direction, explore as much as possible, then backtrack to explore the other direction. But how to represent that in the graph?\n\nThe example shows that each time a new room is entered, the graph is updated with the nodes and edges. So, the first move from Closet to either west or east. Let's pick west. The graph would then have Closet and the new room (let's say Room A). The edge from Closet to Room A would be added under west.
