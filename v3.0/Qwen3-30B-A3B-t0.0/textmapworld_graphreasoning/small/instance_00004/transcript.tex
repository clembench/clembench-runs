	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in the Guest room and can only go west. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since there's only one direction available, west, that's the obvious choice. But I should check if there's any hidden information. The example shows that when moving, the graph is updated. So, the initial step is to go west. The graph should include the Guest room as a node and the edge from Guest room to the next room (which is not yet known). Wait, but the user hasn't entered the next room yet. The example shows that when you move, the next room is added to the nodes. But in the first step, the user is in the Guest room, and after moving west, they enter another room. But the problem is, the user hasn't provided the name of the next room. Hmm, maybe the system is designed to assume that moving in a direction leads to a new room, and the graph is built as you go. \\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first action is to go west. The graph should have "Guest room" as a node, and the west edge would connect to the next room. But since the next room's name isn't given, maybe the edges are represented as tuples of room names. However, in the example, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edges.west
