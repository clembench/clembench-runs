        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Closet with available directions north and south. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best direction to go first.<br/><br/>Hmm, since the user hasn&#x27;t explored any other rooms yet, the graph is just the Closet. The first move should be to go either north or south. But which one? The problem is that I don&#x27;t have information about the layout. Maybe I should pick one direction and proceed. Let&#x27;s say north. But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a way to minimize backtracking. However, without knowing the structure, it&#x27;s a bit tricky. <br/><br/>The example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new room and the edge. So the first step is to go north. The next step would be to add the new room to the nodes and connect it with an edge. But since the user hasn&#x27;t encountered any other rooms yet, the initial graph has only the Closet. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s first instruction is to choose between north and south. The answer should be a GO action with one of those directions. The graph should include the Closet as the first node. The edges for the other directions would be empty. So the initial graph is {&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Closet&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;: {&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}}. <br/><br/>But when the user moves north, the next room</p>
