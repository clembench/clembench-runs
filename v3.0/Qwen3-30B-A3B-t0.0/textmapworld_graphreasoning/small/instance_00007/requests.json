In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west.

But since the user is in the Home theater, and the only available direction is west, there's no choice here. So the first action is to go west. \n\nNow, the graph needs to be updated. The nodes should include \"Home theater\" and the next room. But the user hasn't entered the next room yet. Wait, the example shows that when you go west, the next room is added to the nodes. So in the first step, the graph starts with \"Home theater\" as the only node. Then, when moving west, the next room (let's say it's a corridor or something) is added. But the user hasn't provided the name of the next room. Hmm, maybe the system will handle that. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to provide the graph representing the map uncovered.
