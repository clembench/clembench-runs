In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is in the Closet, and the available directions are south and west. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So, I need to figure out the best direction to go first.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each move adds a new room to the graph. The initial room is the Closet. The user can go south or west. Let me think about which direction might lead to more rooms without backtracking. But since I don't have information about the layout, maybe I should choose one direction and explore it, then backtrack if needed. But the problem says to minimize room changes, so maybe a depth-first approach would be better to explore as far as possible before backtracking.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided any prior information, I have to make an assumption. Let's say the user goes west first. So the next room would be connected west from the Closet. Then, in the next step, they can explore further. Alternatively, going south. But without knowing the map, it's arbitrary. However, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new node and the edge. So, the first move should be either west or south. Let's pick west. So the action is \"GO: west\", and the graph includes the Closet and the new room (let's say it's a Room X). The edges would have a west connection from Closet to Room X. But since",
