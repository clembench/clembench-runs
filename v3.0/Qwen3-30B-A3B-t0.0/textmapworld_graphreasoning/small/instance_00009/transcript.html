        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot;,&quot;graph&quot;:&quot;{&quot;nodes&quot;:[], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [], &quot;south&quot;: [], &quot;east&quot;: [], &quot;west&quot;: []}&quot;}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!<br/>Here is an example: <br/>You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: west&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: north&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;:[&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;],&quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;:[],&quot;south&quot;:[],&quot;east&quot;:[],&quot;west&quot;:[(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;GO: east&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;:{&quot;nodes&quot;: [&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;], &quot;edges&quot;:{&quot;north&quot;: [(&quot;Library&quot;, &quot;Kitchen&quot;)],&quot;south&quot;: [],&quot;east&quot;: [],&quot;west&quot;: [(&quot;Living Room&quot;, &quot;Library&quot;)]}}}<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;action&quot;: &quot;DONE&quot;, &quot;graph&quot;: {...}}<br/>Let us start.<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. The user is in the Kitchen with available directions north and south. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to figure out the best direction to go next.<br/><br/>First, I should consider the current state. The Kitchen is already part of the graph. The available directions are north and south. The example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new room and the edges. So, if I go north, I need to check if that leads to a new room. Similarly for south.<br/><br/>But since the user hasn&#x27;t provided information about what&#x27;s in those directions, I have to assume that each direction might lead to a new room. However, the problem is to minimize the number of room changes. So maybe I should explore one direction first, then backtrack if needed. But since the user is expecting a single step, I need to choose one direction.<br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s example shows that when moving, the graph is built incrementally. So the first step is to go either north or south. Let&#x27;s say I choose north. Then, the next step would be to check the new room&#x27;s directions. But since the user hasn&#x27;t given any info about the rooms beyond the Kitchen, I have to make an assumption here.<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the problem is to simulate the exploration process, where each move adds to the graph. The key is to track all visited rooms and ensure that all are covered.</p>
