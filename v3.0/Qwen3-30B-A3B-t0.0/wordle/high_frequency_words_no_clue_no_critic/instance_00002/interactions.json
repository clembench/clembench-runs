You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.",

The target word is a five-letter English word. I have six attempts. Each guess gives feedback: green for correct letter and position, yellow for correct letter but wrong position, red for incorrect.\n\nThe first guess should be a common five-letter word. Maybe \"apple\" as the example. But maybe there's a better starting word. Wait, in the example, the user used \"apple\" as the first guess. But maybe I should think of a word that has common letters. Like \"crane\" or \"raise\" which are often suggested as starting words because they have vowels and common consonants.\n\nBut the user's example used \"apple\", so maybe I should follow that. But the user is asking me to generate the first guess. Let me think. The explanation needs to be concise. So for the first guess, I need to pick a word that's valid and explain why. Let me go with \"crane\" as a starting guess. It has vowels (a, e) and common consonants (c, r, n). Alternatively, \"raise\" is another option. Or \"soare\" which is a valid word. Wait, but maybe \"apple\" is a safe choice since it's a common word. But the example used \"apple\", so maybe the user",
