	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Home gym. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user says the target room is the Home gym, and they're already in the Home gym. The available directions are west and east. But since they're already in the target room, they don't need to move. So the correct answer should be DONE. I need to make sure I don't go in any direction because there's no need to move. The example shows that once you find the target, you just say DONE. So here, since they're already there, immediately respond with DONE.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE
