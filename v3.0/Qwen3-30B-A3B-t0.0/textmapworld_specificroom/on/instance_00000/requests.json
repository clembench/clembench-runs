The user says the target room is the Home gym, and they're already in the Home gym. The available directions are west and east. But since they're already in the target room, they don't need to move. So the correct answer should be DONE. I need to make sure I don't go in any direction because there's no need to move. The example shows that once you find the target, you just say DONE. So here, since they're already there, immediately respond with DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE<|im_end|>",
