The user's task is to explore rooms and find the target room. The current situation is that the target room is the Exercise room, and they're already in the Exercise room. The available direction is west. But wait, if they're already in the target room, they don't need to move. The instructions say to answer with \"DONE\" once the target is found. So the correct action here is to immediately respond with DONE. The available directions might be a bit misleading, but since they're already in the target, moving isn't necessary. So the answer should be DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE<|im_end|>",
