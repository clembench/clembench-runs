Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

But wait, the example shows that when you reach the target room, you answer with DONE. But in this case, they're already in the target room. So maybe the answer is DONE immediately. But the available directions are south and west. But since they're already in the target room, maybe they just need to confirm. But according to the instructions, once the target room is found, answer with DONE. So even if they're already there, the answer should be DONE. But the user might have made a mistake here. But I have to follow the rules. So the correct response is DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE",
