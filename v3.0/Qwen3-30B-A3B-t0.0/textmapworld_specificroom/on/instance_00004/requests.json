The user says the target room is the Game room, and they're already in the Game room. So the available directions are north, west, east. But since they're already in the target room, they should just answer DONE. No need to move anywhere else. The example shows that once you find the target, you say DONE. So the correct answer here is DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE<|im_end|>",
