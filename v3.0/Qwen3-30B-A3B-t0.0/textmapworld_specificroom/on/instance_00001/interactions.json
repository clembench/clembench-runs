Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

But wait, the example shows that once you reach the target room, you answer with \"DONE\". So since they're already in the target room, they should just say DONE. The available directions are east, but maybe there's a typo? Because if they're in the Bathroom and the target is the same, maybe there's no need to move. But the user might have made a mistake in the setup. But according to the problem, the answer should be DONE because they're already there. So the correct response is DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE",
