The user's task is to explore rooms and find the target room. The current situation is that the target room is the Study room, and they're already in the Study room. The available directions are north and west. But since they're already in the target room, they should just answer DONE. No need to move anywhere else. The example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. So the correct response here is DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE<|im_end|>",
