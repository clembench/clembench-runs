Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target room is the Cellar, and I'm starting in the Closet. The only available direction is east. So I need to go east first. But wait, maybe I should check if there are more steps needed. But according to the example, once you reach the target, you say DONE. But here, the user hasn't told me what's in the next room. The Closet's only exit is east. So I should go east. But what if the next room isn't the Cellar? The problem is that I don't have a map. The user is expecting me to navigate based on the directions given. Since the initial step is to go east, I'll do that. But I need to make sure that if the next room is the Cellar, I say DONE. Otherwise, proceed. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details, I have to assume that going east from Closet leads to the Cellar. Or maybe not. Wait, the example had multiple steps. So maybe I need to proceed step by step. The first instruction is to go east. So the answer should be GO: east. But the user might have more steps. However, the user's message ends there. So the initial answer is to go east.\n</think>\n\nGO: east<|im_end|>",
