Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So I need to go west first. But wait, maybe I should check if there are more directions. Oh, the available directions are only west. So I have to go west. Then, after moving, I'll be in another room. The next step would be to check the new directions. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details, I can only proceed with the given info. So the first move is definitely west. Then, once I reach the next room, I'll see what directions are available. But since the target is Study room, maybe after moving west, I'll find it. But the example shows that after moving, the next directions are given. So I need to follow the steps as they come. For now, the answer is GO: west.\n</think>\n\nGO: west",
