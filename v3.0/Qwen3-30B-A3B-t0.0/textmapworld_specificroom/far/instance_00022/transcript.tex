	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Study room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Study room. I start in the Craft room, and the only available direction is west. So I need to go west first. But wait, maybe I should check if there are more directions. Oh, the available directions are only west. So I have to go west. Then, after moving, I'll be in another room. The next step would be to check the new directions. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details, I can only proceed with the given info. So the first move is definitely west. Then, once I reach the next room, I'll see what directions are available. But since the target is Study room, maybe after moving west, I'll find it. But the example shows that after moving, the next directions are given. So I need to follow the steps as they come. For now, the answer is GO: west.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west
