Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Conservatory. You are in the Study room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should recall the layout of the rooms. Typically, in these kinds of puzzles, rooms are connected in a grid or specific layout. But since I don't have a map, I have to rely on logical steps. Let me think: the Study room's possible exits are north and west. Let me consider each direction.\n\nIf I go north from the Study, where would that lead? Maybe another room like the Library or a Hall. If I go west, perhaps the Library or a different corridor. But without knowing the exact layout, I need to make an educated guess. Sometimes, the target room might be in a specific direction based on common layouts. For example, Conservatories are sometimes located in the back of a house, maybe to the west or south. But since the available directions are north and west, I need to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern. Let's say I go west first. If that's not leading me to the Conservatory, I can backtrack. But since I can only give one instruction here, I need to choose. Let me go with west first. So the answer would be GO: west. Then, depending on the next room, I can adjust. If that's not correct, the next",
