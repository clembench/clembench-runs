	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Conservatory. You are in the Study room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target room is the Conservatory, and I'm starting in the Study room. The available directions from the Study are north and west. I need to figure out which way to go.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should recall the layout of the rooms. Typically, in these kinds of puzzles, rooms are connected in a grid or specific layout. But since I don't have a map, I have to rely on logical steps. Let me think: the Study room's possible exits are north and west. Let me consider each direction.\\ \tt \\ \tt If I go north from the Study, where would that lead? Maybe another room like the Library or a Hall. If I go west, perhaps the Library or a different corridor. But without knowing the exact layout, I need to make an educated guess. Sometimes, the target room might be in a specific direction based on common layouts. For example, Conservatories are sometimes located in the back of a house, maybe to the west or south. But since the available directions are north and west, I need to pick one.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern. Let's say I go west first. If that's not leading me to the Conservatory, I can backtrack. But since I can only give one instruction here, I need to choose. Let me go with west first. So the answer would be GO: west. Then, depending on the next room, I can adjust. If that's not correct, the next
