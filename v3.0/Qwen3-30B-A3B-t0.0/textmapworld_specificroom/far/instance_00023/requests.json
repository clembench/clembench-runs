Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The user is in the Exercise room, and the target is the Game room. The only available direction is west. So the first step is to go west. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other information I'm missing. The example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. But here, moving west from the Exercise room would take them to another room. The problem is that the user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms, so I have to assume that moving west from the Exercise room is the correct path. Since there's only one direction available, west, that's the only option. So the next instruction should be GO: west. I don't know what's beyond that, but according to the problem, I just need to follow the directions given. If that leads to the Game room, then they'll get there. Otherwise, maybe there's more steps, but based on the info given, that's the only possible move.\n</think>\n\nGO: west<|im_end|>",
