	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Guest room. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target room is the Guest room, and I'm starting in the Bathroom. The available directions from here are south and west. I need to figure out which way to go.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about the possible layout. If I go south from the Bathroom, maybe that leads to another room. Alternatively, going west might also lead somewhere. Since the target is the Guest room, I need to consider which direction is more likely. But without a map, I have to guess. Maybe I should try one direction first. Let's say I go west. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. But since the example had the user go west first, maybe that's a common approach. Wait, but the example was different. In the example, the user went west from the Kitchen to the Lobby. So maybe going west from the Bathroom could lead to a corridor or another room. Alternatively, south might be the correct path. But I don't have more information. I'll have to choose one. Let me go with west first. If that's not the right path, I can try south next. But the problem is that I can't go back unless I have a way. Wait, the user is supposed to explore step by step. So the first move should be to go west. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user went west, then north, then eventually found the target. So maybe following a
