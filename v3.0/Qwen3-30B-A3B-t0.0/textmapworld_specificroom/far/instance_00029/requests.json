Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

The available directions from the Balcony are north, south, and west. I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should think about the possible layout. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to guess based on typical room arrangements. Balconies are often connected to rooms like a living room, bedroom, or maybe a kitchen. The Laundry room is usually somewhere else, maybe adjacent to a bedroom or a hallway.\n\nIf I go north from the Balcony, maybe that leads to a bedroom. South could lead to another area, like a patio or another room. West might be towards a hallway. But without more info, it's tricky. Maybe I should try one direction and see. Let's say I go west first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. Alternatively, maybe the Laundry room is directly connected. But since the user wants the correct path, I need to think of the most logical direction.\n\nWait, in some house layouts, the Laundry room is near the back, so maybe south? Or maybe west. Hmm. Alternatively, if the Balcony is on the north side, going south might lead towards the middle of the house. But I'm just guessing. Since the example had the target in a Bedroom after a few steps, maybe here the Laundry room is a few steps away",
