	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Game room. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Game room. I start in the Home gym, and the available directions are west and east. Hmm, I need to figure out which way to go.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should consider the possible layout. Since I don't have a map, I have to make decisions based on typical room arrangements. Home gyms are often located in areas that might connect to other rooms. Let me think: if I go west from the Home gym, maybe that leads to another room. Alternatively, east could be another path. But without more information, I need to choose one. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example had the user go west first. Maybe there's a pattern? Or maybe it's random. Since the user hasn't provided any specific details about the rooms, I have to assume that either direction could lead to the target. But since the target is the Game room, perhaps I should try one direction and if it doesn't work, backtrack. \\ \tt \\ \tt But the problem is that I can't actually explore, so I need to simulate the steps. Let me think of possible room connections. For instance, Home gym might be connected to a Living room, which then connects to the Game room. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, going west from Home gym could lead to a Bedroom, and then from there to the Game room. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the Game room is directly connected. But since
