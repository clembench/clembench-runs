Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen.

The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Game room. I start in the Home gym, and the available directions are west and east. Hmm, I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible layout. Since I don't have a map, I have to make decisions based on typical room arrangements. Home gyms are often located in areas that might connect to other rooms. Let me think: if I go west from the Home gym, maybe that leads to another room. Alternatively, east could be another path. But without more information, I need to choose one. \n\nWait, the example had the user go west first. Maybe there's a pattern? Or maybe it's random. Since the user hasn't provided any specific details about the rooms, I have to assume that either direction could lead to the target. But since the target is the Game room, perhaps I should try one direction and if it doesn't work, backtrack. \n\nBut the problem is that I can't actually explore, so I need to simulate the steps. Let me think of possible room connections. For instance, Home gym might be connected to a Living room, which then connects to the Game room. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, going west from Home gym could lead to a Bedroom, and then from there to the Game room. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Game room is directly connected. But since",
