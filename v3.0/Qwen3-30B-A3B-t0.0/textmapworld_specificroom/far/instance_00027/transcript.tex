	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Utility room. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target room is the Utility room, and I'm starting in the Home theater. The available direction is west. So I need to go west first. But wait, maybe I should check if the Utility room is directly west or if there are other rooms in between. But since the problem says to explore rooms and find the target, I should just follow the directions given.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first step is to go west. Let me input "GO: west". Then, depending on where that leads, I'll proceed. If the next room's directions include the target, I'll go there. Otherwise, keep moving. But since the example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. So I just need to keep going in the correct directions until I find it. But the user hasn't given the layout, so I have to assume that each step's available directions are provided. Wait, the user's example shows that after each move, the available directions are given. But in the actual problem, the user might not provide all the details. Wait, no, the user is giving me the initial setup, and then I have to respond with the next instruction. But in the example, the user provided the available directions each time. However, in the current problem, the user only gives the initial available directions. So maybe I need to proceed step by step, but since I don't have the actual map, I have to make assumptions.
