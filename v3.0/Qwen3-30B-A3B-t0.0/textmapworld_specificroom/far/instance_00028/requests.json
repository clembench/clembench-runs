The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Study room. They start in the Craft room, and the only available direction is east. So my first move should be to go east. I need to make sure I follow the format, just saying \"GO: east\" and then when I reach the target, say \"DONE\". No other text. Let me check the example again to be sure. Yep, once in the target room, answer with DONE. So first step is to go east from Craft room. Let's do that.\n</think>\n\nGO: east<|im_end|>",
