Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

Let me think about the layout. If I go east from the Bathroom, maybe that leads to another room. But I don't have a map, so I have to guess based on typical layouts.\n\nIn many house plans, the Bathroom might be near the Kitchen or a hallway. But since the only available direction is east, I should go that way. Let's say going east from the Bathroom takes me to a Lobby or a Hallway. Then, from there, I need to figure out the next direction towards the Solarium. But without more info, I have to proceed step by step. So the first move is definitely east. Then, depending on where that leads, I'll decide the next step. But the user just asked for the first instruction, so it's GO: east.\n</think>\n\nGO: east",
