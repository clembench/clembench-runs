	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Exercise room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Bathroom. They start in the Exercise room, and the only available direction is west. So my first move should be to go west. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other information I'm missing. The example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. But here, the Exercise room's only exit is west. So I need to go west first. Let me make sure there's no other directions. The user said "currently available directions: west," so no other options. So the next step is definitely GO: west. Then, after moving, I'll check the new room's directions. But since the target is Bathroom, if moving west leads to it, then I can finish. Otherwise, proceed from there. But the user hasn't provided the next steps after that. So the first answer is GO: west.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west
