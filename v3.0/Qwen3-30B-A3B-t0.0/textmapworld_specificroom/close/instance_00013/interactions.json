Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So my first move should be to go west. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other information I'm missing. The example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. But here, the Exercise room's only exit is west. So I need to go west first. Let me make sure there's no other directions. The user said \"currently available directions: west,\" so no other options. So the next step is definitely GO: west. Then, after moving, I'll check the new room's directions. But since the target is Bathroom, if moving west leads to it, then I can finish. Otherwise, proceed from there. But the user hasn't provided the next steps after that. So the first answer is GO: west.\n</think>\n\nGO: west",
