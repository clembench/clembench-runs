Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Sauna. You are in the Balcony. Currently available directions: north, south, west. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should think about the possible layout. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to make logical guesses. The Balcony is usually connected to other rooms. Let me consider each direction:\n\n- North: Maybe leading to another room like a Bedroom or a Hall.\n- South: Could be towards a common area or maybe the Sauna directly?\n- West: Possibly a corridor or another adjacent room.\n\nBut since the target is Sauna, maybe I should check if any of these directions lead closer. If I go north first, then south, then west, or some combination. But without more info, it's tricky. Maybe the Sauna is directly accessible from the Balcony? But the available directions are north, south, west. Let me pick one. Maybe west? Or perhaps south? Wait, sometimes in such puzzles, the directions might have a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the Sauna is connected via a specific path. Since I have to choose, I'll go with west first. Let's try west. If that's not right, I can backtrack.\n\nSo the first move would be GO: west.\n</think>\n\nGO: west",
