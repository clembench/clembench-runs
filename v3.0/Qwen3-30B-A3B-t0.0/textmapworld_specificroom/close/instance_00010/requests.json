Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

The target room is the Guest room, and I'm starting in the Home gym. The available directions are west and east. Hmm, I need to figure out which way to go. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to make an educated guess. Maybe the Guest room is connected to the Home gym via one of these directions. Let me think about typical room layouts. Sometimes, gyms might be near the entrance or maybe towards the back of the house. If I go west first, maybe that leads to another room. Alternatively, east could be another path. But without more information, it's tricky. I'll pick one direction and proceed. Let's try west first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. So the next step should be to go west.\n</think>\n\nGO: west<|im_end|>",
