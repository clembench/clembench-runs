Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target room is the Dining room, and I'm starting in the Craft room. The only available direction is east. So I need to go east first. But wait, maybe I should check if the Craft room's east direction leads directly to the Dining room. If not, I might need to explore other paths. But since the example shows that sometimes you have to go through other rooms, maybe I should just follow the initial direction. Let me think. The user said to give the next instruction as \"GO: DIRECTION\" and once the target is found, say \"DONE\". Since the available direction is east, I should go east. If that's not the Dining room, then maybe there's another step. But the problem is, I don't have more information. So the first step is to go east. Let me write that.\n</think>\n\nGO: east<|im_end|>",
