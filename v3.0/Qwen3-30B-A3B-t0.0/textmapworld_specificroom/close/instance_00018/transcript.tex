	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Dining room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target room is the Dining room, and I'm starting in the Craft room. The only available direction is east. So I need to go east first. But wait, maybe I should check if the Craft room's east direction leads directly to the Dining room. If not, I might need to explore other paths. But since the example shows that sometimes you have to go through other rooms, maybe I should just follow the initial direction. Let me think. The user said to give the next instruction as "GO: DIRECTION" and once the target is found, say "DONE". Since the available direction is east, I should go east. If that's not the Dining room, then maybe there's another step. But the problem is, I don't have more information. So the first step is to go east. Let me write that.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east
