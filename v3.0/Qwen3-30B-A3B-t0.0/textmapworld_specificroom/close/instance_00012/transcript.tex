	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Exercise room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in the Craft room, and the target room is the Exercise room. The available direction is west. So the first step is to go west. But wait, where does west lead? The example shows that moving west from the Kitchen went to the Lobby. But here, the Craft room's only available direction is west. So I need to check if going west will take them closer to the Exercise room.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the problem is, I don't have a map. The user hasn't provided any details about the layout of the rooms. The example had specific rooms like Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom, but here the target is Exercise room. Since the user is in the Craft room, and the only direction available is west, the only logical step is to go west. Maybe the Exercise room is in that direction. If not, maybe they'll have to backtrack, but since the user hasn't given more info, I have to assume that the correct path is west. So the answer should be GO: west. Once they reach the Exercise room, then say DONE. But since the user hasn't provided the next steps, I just need to give the first instruction.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west
