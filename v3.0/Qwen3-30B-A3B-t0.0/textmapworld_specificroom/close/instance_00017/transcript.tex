	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Exercise room. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to help find the target room, which is the Exercise room. They started in the Home theater, and the only available direction is west. So the first step is to go west. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other information I need. The example shows that once you reach the target, you say DONE. But here, they're in the Home theater, and the directions are only west. So the next move is to go west. I don't know what's beyond that, but according to the instructions, I just need to give the GO command. So the answer should be GO: west.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west
