Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

The target room is the Solarium, and I'm starting in the Bathroom. The available directions from here are south and west. I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should think about the possible layout. Usually, in these kinds of puzzles, rooms are connected in a grid or some logical pattern. The Bathroom is probably connected to other rooms. Let me try to visualize or recall common room layouts. \n\nIf I'm in the Bathroom, going south or west. Let's consider possible paths. Maybe the Solarium is in a specific direction from the Bathroom. But without more information, I have to make an educated guess. Sometimes, these problems use standard layouts. For example, maybe the Bathroom is connected to a Hallway, and from there to other rooms. \n\nIf I go west first, maybe that leads to a different area. Alternatively, going south. Let me think. If I go west from the Bathroom, perhaps I reach a Room that's connected to the Solarium. Or maybe south leads directly. But since I don't have a map, I need to try one direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern. For example, if the target is Solarium, which is a room with lots of windows, maybe it's on the east side of the building. But that's just a guess. \n\nWait, the user hasn't given any other information except the starting point and the target. So I",
