Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target room is the Studio, and I'm starting in the Game room. The available directions are north, west, and east. I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible layout. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to guess based on typical room arrangements. The Game room might connect to other rooms. Let me think: if I go north, maybe that leads to another room. But without more info, it's tricky. Maybe I should try one direction and see. Let's pick north first. Wait, but maybe there's a better approach. Sometimes, in these puzzles, the directions correspond to specific rooms. For example, east might lead to a hallway, west to a different area. But since the target is Studio, perhaps I need to check each direction step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Studio is adjacent to the Game room. But the problem says to explore, so I have to move step by step. Let me choose a direction. Let's go north. If that's not right, I can backtrack. But since the user wants the next instruction, I need to pick one. Let's go with north. Wait, but the example had the user go west first. Maybe there's a pattern? Not sure. Let me just pick north as the first move.\n</think>\n\nGO: north<|im_end|>",
