Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Let me check what's next. If I go east, maybe there's a corridor or another room. But since the example had a Lobby and then a Bedroom, maybe there are multiple steps. But the user only asked for the next instruction. So the first step is to go east. Then, depending on where that leads, I might have more directions. But the user wants the next instruction now. So the answer should be GO: east.\n</think>\n\nGO: east",
