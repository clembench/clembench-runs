Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target room is Foyer, and I'm starting in the Study room. The available directions from here are north and west. I need to figure out which way to go.\n\nFirst, I should consider the possible layout. Usually, rooms are connected in a way that makes sense. The Study might be connected to other rooms. If I go north from the Study, maybe that leads to another room. Alternatively, west could be another path. But since the target is Foyer, I need to think about where the Foyer might be located.\n\nIn many house layouts, the Foyer is often near the entrance, maybe connected to the main hallway. If the Study is on the north side, going north might take me towards the Foyer. Alternatively, maybe west is the correct direction. But without more information, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nWait, the example had the target room being a Bedroom, and the user had to navigate through Kitchen, Lobby, etc. So maybe the Foyer is connected via a specific path. Since the available directions are north and west, I need to pick one. Let's say I go north first. If that's not correct, maybe I can backtrack. But since I can't go back, I have to choose. Alternatively, maybe the Foyer is west from the Study. But I don't know. Let me go with north first. If that's wrong, the next step would be to",
