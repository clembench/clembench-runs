	 Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below. You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\\ \tt The goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\\ \tt The more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Always give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: <WORD>\\ \tt TARGETS: <TARGETS>\\ \tt \\ \tt Your team words are: bark, bat, rail, bolt, cock, fly, strain, jerk, stem.\\ \tt Your opponent's team words are: pro, rally, pound, peep, fit, stunt, fleet, beetle.\\ \tt Distractor words are: slip, cuff, post, plot, pit, jog, rubber.\\ \tt The kill words are: ham.

The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about the connections.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, looking at the words: bark is like a tree's outer layer or a dog's sound. Bat is the animal or the baseball bat. Rail is a track or a fence part. Bolt is a fastener or a lightning bolt. Cock is a male bird or to turn something. Fly is the insect or to move through air. Strain is to exert or a type of stress. Jerk is a sudden pull or a rude person. Stem is the main part of a plant or to stop something.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe there's a common theme here. Let's see if they can be related to parts of something. For example, "stem" is part of a plant, "bark" is part of a tree. "Rail" could be part of a train track. "Bolt" is a part of machinery. "Cock" might be part of a mechanism, like a cock in a gun. "Fly" could be part of a flywheel. "Jerk" might relate to movement. "Strain" could be part of a process.
