You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: bark, angle, rake, slam, pad, match, bowl, jar, flush.\nYour opponent's team words are: snuff, buffer, grave, stir, rank, meter, tag, shower.\nDistractor words are: pit, cuff, boil, chip, jam, fan, rocket.\nThe kill words are: beetle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: bark, angle, rake, slam, pad, match, bowl, jar, flush. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about the connections.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: bark, angle, rake, slam, pad, match, bowl, jar, flush. Hmm. Maybe some of these are actions or objects related to a specific category. Let's break them down.\n\nBark could be the sound a dog makes, but maybe it's the tree bark? Angle is a geometric term. Rake is a garden tool. Slam is a forceful action. Pad could be a cushion or a type of writing pad. Match could be a competition or a matchstick. Bowl is a container. Jar is a container too. Flush could be a toilet action or a color. \n\nWait, maybe some of these are types of tools or actions related to cleaning or gardening? Rake is definitely a garden tool. Bowl and jar are containers. Maybe \"clean\" as a clue? But does that connect to others? Flush is related to cleaning a toilet. But does that connect to the others? Maybe not all. Let's see: flush, bowl, jar, maybe pad (like a cleaning pad), but not sure about the others. \n\nAnother angle: some of these words can be verbs",
