You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: jig, peck, plump, toast, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill.\nYour opponent's team words are: stripe, pool, rubber, pad, clutch, stable, mint, lean.\nDistractor words are: corn, boil, bridge, strain, sap, rail, jumper.\nThe kill words are: file.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: jig, peck, plump, toast, pry, seal, hitch, truck, drill. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about the connections.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: jig is a dance, peck is a light touch or a bird's action, plump is full, toast is something you eat or praise, pry is to open forcefully, seal is to close, hitch is a problem or a ride, truck is a vehicle, drill is to bore or a tool. Maybe there's a common theme here. \n\nHmm, some of these words can be verbs and nouns. For example, \"drill\" can be a tool or the action of boring a hole. \"Pry\" is similar to \"drill\" in that they both involve forcing something open. \"Pry\" and \"drill\" might relate to tools or actions. \"Truck\" is a vehicle, but maybe \"drill\" and \"pry\" are tools. Wait, \"drill\" is a tool, \"pry\" could be a crowbar. But how to connect them all?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"tool\" is the clue. Let's check: drill is a tool, pry (as in using a tool to pry something open), truck (maybe a tool",
