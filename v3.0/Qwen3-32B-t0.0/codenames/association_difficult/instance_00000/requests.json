You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: underwear, cedar, stairs, sapphire, satin, mile, mint, nose, toe.\nYour opponent's team words are: rosemary, opal, blouse, yard, tomato, cotton, basement, nylon.\nDistractor words are: floor, orange, onyx, sage, melon, velvet, inch.\nThe kill words are: lobby.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are: underwear, cedar, stairs, sapphire, satin, mile, mint, nose, toe. The opponent's words are different, and there are distractors and a kill word.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or categories that connect multiple team words. Let's list them again: underwear, cedar, stairs, sapphire, satin, mile, mint, nose, toe. \n\nUnderwear is a type of clothing. Cedar is a type of wood. Stairs are part of a building structure. Sapphire is a gemstone. Satin is a fabric. Mile is a unit of distance. Mint is a plant or a freshness. Nose and toe are body parts. \n\nLooking for overlaps or categories. Maybe fabrics or materials? Satin and cedar (wood) could be materials. But cedar is wood, satin is fabric. Sapphire is a gem. Maybe not. \n\nBody parts: nose and toe. Are there others? Maybe not. \n\nUnits of measurement: mile, inch (but inch is a distractor). \n\nColors? Sapphire is blue, mint is a color. But not sure. \n\nUnderwear and blouse (opponent's word) are clothing. Maybe not helpful. \n\nWait, \"satin\" is a fabric, \"underwear\" is clothing. Maybe \"fabric\" as a clue?",
