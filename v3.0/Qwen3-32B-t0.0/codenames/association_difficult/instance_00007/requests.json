You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: mango, topaz, igloo, onion, cucumber, uncle, asparagus, mace, lamp.\nYour opponent's team words are: plum, hotel, armoire, herbs, house, ankle, mother, gem.\nDistractor words are: axe, apricot, desk, face, grape, cumin, son.\nThe kill words are: sage.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are mango, topaz, igloo, onion, cucumber, uncle, asparagus, mace, lamp. The opponent's words are plum, hotel, armoire, herbs, house, ankle, mother, gem. Distractors are axe, apricot, desk, face, grape, cumin, son. Kill word is sage.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or categories that connect multiple team words. Let's list them out:\n\nMango, onion, cucumber, asparagus, and maybe others are foods or vegetables. But mango is a fruit, onion and cucumber are vegetables, asparagus is a vegetable. But then there's igloo, which is a structure made of ice. Topaz is a gemstone. Uncle is a family relation. Mace is a weapon or a spice. Lamp is an object. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe some of these can be grouped by color? Let's see. Mango is yellow, topaz can be yellow or other colors, igloo is white, onion is white or purple, cucumber is green, asparagus is green, mace (the spice) is yellow, lamp could be any color. Not sure if color is a good angle.\n\nAnother angle: parts of something. For example, mace is part of a lamp (like a lamp's mace",
