You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: torso, melon, elephant, actor, rape, pants, robin, chef, tuna.\nYour opponent's team words are: mango, dress, officer, speeding, crappie, slacks, sheep, turkey.\nDistractor words are: sweatshirt, salmon, lieutenant, theft, larceny, parakeet, minnow.\nThe kill words are: nose.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are torso, melon, elephant, actor, rape, pants, robin, chef, tuna. The opponent's words are mango, dress, officer, speeding, crappie, slacks, sheep, turkey. Distractors are sweatshirt, salmon, lieutenant, theft, larceny, parakeet, minnow. Kill word is nose.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or categories that connect multiple team words. Let's list them again: torso, melon, elephant, actor, rape, pants, robin, chef, tuna. \n\nHmm. Torso is part of the body. Melon is a fruit. Elephant is an animal. Actor is a profession. Rape is a crime. Pants are clothing. Robin is a bird. Chef is a profession. Tuna is a fish. \n\nLooking for overlaps or categories. Maybe \"clothing\" could connect pants and maybe others? But the opponent has slacks, which is similar. Maybe \"fish\" for tuna and crappie (opponent's word), but crappie is theirs. \"Bird\" for robin and turkey (opponent's). \"Fruit\" for melon and mango (opponent's). \n\nWhat about \"body parts\"? Torso is a body part. But the opponent has none. Maybe \"animal\"?",
