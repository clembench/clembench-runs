You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: horn, piano, crane, knife, wave, code, jam, tower, heart.\nYour opponent's team words are: mexico, carrot, march, slip, crown, cap, bond, luck.\nDistractor words are: millionaire, pole, chair, plate, wake, satellite, cricket.\nThe kill words are: pupil.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: horn, piano, crane, knife, wave, code, jam, tower, heart. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about possible connections.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: horn, piano, crane, knife, wave, code, jam, tower, heart. Maybe some of these are parts of the body? Like heart is a body part. But horn could be a body part too, like a cow's horn. But maybe not. Crane is a bird, but also a machine. Tower is a structure. Piano is a musical instrument. Knife is a tool. Wave is a movement. Code could be a cipher. Jam is a fruit spread or a traffic jam. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe some of these are parts of the body. Let's check: heart is definitely a body part. Horn could be a body part, but not common. Crane isn't a body part. Knife isn't. Wave is a movement. Code isn't. Jam isn't. Tower isn't. So maybe heart is the only one. But that's only one word. Maybe another angle.\n\nWhat about musical terms? Piano is a musical instrument. Horn is a musical instrument. Maybe \"music\" as a clue? But then piano and horn are related. But code and jam could also be related",
