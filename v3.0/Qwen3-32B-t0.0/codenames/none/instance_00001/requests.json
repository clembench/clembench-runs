You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: grass, sock, satellite, ketchup, code, pyramid, sink, police, boot.\nYour opponent's team words are: moscow, capital, pound, tap, phoenix, ruler, saturn, deck.\nDistractor words are: field, fish, germany, eye, whale, duck, shoe.\nThe kill words are: jam.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: grass, sock, satellite, ketchup, code, pyramid, sink, police, boot. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about possible connections.\n\nFirst, looking at the words. Grass and field are related, but field is a distractor. Sock and shoe are related, but shoe is a distractor. Maybe \"footwear\" but that's two words. Satellite and satellite... maybe space? But code and satellite might not connect. Ketchup is a condiment. Code could be programming or a cipher. Pyramid is a shape or structure. Sink is a fixture. Police are law enforcement. Boot could be footwear or to start a computer.\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a common theme. Maybe \"boot\" and \"sock\" are both footwear. \"Boot\" and \"sock\" could be linked with \"foot.\" But \"foot\" is part of \"sock,\" which isn't allowed. Maybe \"shoe\" is a clue, but shoe is a distractor. Wait, the clue can't be a distractor word either. So maybe \"footwear\" is too long. Alternatively, \"foot\" is a body part. But \"foot\" is part of \"sock\" (sock is for the foot). But the clue can't be part of the target",
