You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: bond, tie, moon, string, czech, row, casino, concert, link.\nYour opponent's team words are: bark, beat, platypus, pyramid, hotel, alien, robin, centaur.\nDistractor words are: pass, belt, leprechaun, star, eye, tag, mug.\nThe kill words are: ninja.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: bond, tie, moon, string, czech, row, casino, concert, link. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about the connections.\n\nFirst, looking at the words: bond, tie, string, link. These all seem to be about connecting things. Maybe \"connect\" is a clue? But wait, \"link\" is already a team word, so the clue can't be \"link\". How about \"connect\"? Let me check if that's allowed. The clue has to be semantically related but not one of the words. \"Connect\" is a verb, but maybe that's okay. Let me see if \"connect\" relates to bond, tie, string, link. Yes, all of those are ways to connect things. But maybe there's a better clue that connects more words.\n\nLooking at other words: moon, czech, row, casino, concert. Hmm. Moon could relate to \"lunar\", but that's not in the opponent's list. Czech is a country, maybe \"Czech Republic\". Row could be a line or a dispute. Casino and concert are both events or places. Maybe \"event\"? But casino and concert are both events. But how does that connect to the others? Maybe not. Let's go back to the connecting words",
