You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: housewifery, defenseman, inflexibility, canola, candlepower, cattiness, playact, battleaxe, assassinator.\nYour opponent's team words are: dwarfism, seafloor, plantain, decisiveness, multidimensionality, dangerousness, undernourishment, pleasantness.\nDistractor words are: pockmark, gingersnap, ineptness, forestation, hyperthermia, undulation, cauterization.\nThe kill words are: towhead.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are: housewifery, defenseman, inflexibility, canola, candlepower, cattiness, playact, battleaxe, assassinator. The opponent's words and distractors are listed too, and there's a kill word to avoid.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or connections among the team's words. Let's go through each one:\n\n- Housewifery: related to managing a household, maybe traditional roles.\n- Defenseman: a position in hockey, so sports-related.\n- Inflexibility: rigidity, not being flexible.\n- Canola: a type of oil or plant.\n- Candlepower: brightness, light measurement.\n- Cattiness: being like a cat, maybe aloof or aggressive.\n- Playact: to pretend or act out.\n- Battleaxe: a weapon, or a term for a domineering woman.\n- Assassinator: someone who kills, especially secretly.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe some words relate to strength, aggression, or roles. \"Battleaxe\" and \"assassinator\" both relate to combat or aggression. \"Cattiness\" and \"battleaxe\" might have a connection to being fierce. \"Defenseman\" is a role in hockey, which is a team sport. \"Housewifery\" is a role in the home",
