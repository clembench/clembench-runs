You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: loftiness, narrowness, backbreaker, candlepower, demineralization, nearness, defacement, denaturalization, checkmark.\nYour opponent's team words are: typeset, demobilization, emersion, darer, nightcaps, hotelkeeper, dualism, shortlist.\nDistractor words are: pleasantness, denseness, assassinator, tonsillitis, defenseman, fortunetelling, secession.\nThe kill words are: shirtfront.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are: loftiness, narrowness, backbreaker, candlepower, demineralization, nearness, defacement, denaturalization, checkmark. The opponent's words and distractors are listed too, and there's a kill word.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or connections among the team's words. Let's go through each one:\n\n- Loftiness: high, elevated, maybe related to height.\n- Narrowness: the opposite of wide, could be about space or scope.\n- Backbreaker: something that's very hard, maybe a heavy load or stress.\n- Candlepower: brightness, light, measurement of light intensity.\n- Demineralization: removal of minerals, maybe related to water or processes.\n- Nearness: closeness, proximity.\n- Defacement: damage to a surface, like vandalism.\n- Denaturalization: removal of natural state, maybe chemical processes.\n- Checkmark: a symbol of correctness, a mark made.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Some words relate to physical properties (narrowness, nearness, backbreaker), others to processes (demineralization, denaturalization), and some to abstract concepts (loftiness, candlepower). Maybe \"intensity\" could work? Let's see:\n\n- Loftiness: high intensity of being elevated.\n-",
