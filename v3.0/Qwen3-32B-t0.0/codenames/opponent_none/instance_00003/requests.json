You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: sound, fair, teacher, band, dragon, cast, star, africa, crown.\nYour opponent's team words are: pass, march, pole, watch, fan, compound, ice, straw.\nDistractor words are: battery, seal, london, helicopter, deck, luck, bar.\nThe kill words are: box.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are sound, fair, teacher, band, dragon, cast, star, africa, crown. The opponent's words are pass, march, pole, watch, fan, compound, ice, straw. Distractors are battery, seal, london, helicopter, deck, luck, bar. Kill word is box.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them again: sound, fair, teacher, band, dragon, cast, star, africa, crown. Hmm. Maybe some of these are related to music? Band, sound, maybe star (like a music star), teacher (music teacher?), but not sure. Or maybe \"cast\" as in a movie cast? But then star could be an actor. But how does that connect to the others?\n\nAnother angle: \"fair\" could be a fairytale, which might connect to dragon. \"Crown\" is part of royalty. \"Africa\" is a continent. \"Teacher\" and \"band\" might be part of a school setting. Maybe \"sound\" and \"star\" could be part of a music or performance context. Wait, \"cast\" could also mean to throw, like casting a spell, but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, \"dragon\" is a mythical creature. \"Crown\" is a symbol of royalty",
