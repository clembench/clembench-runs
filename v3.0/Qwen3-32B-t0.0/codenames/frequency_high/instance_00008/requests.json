You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: daddy, future, mom, hand, kids, charge, question, message, body.\nYour opponent's team words are: sense, evidence, mother, father, floor, way, room, movie.\nDistractor words are: husband, lunch, car, control, blood, order, dinner.\nThe kill words are: state.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are daddy, future, mom, hand, kids, charge, question, message, body. The opponent's words are sense, evidence, mother, father, floor, way, room, movie. Distractors are husband, lunch, car, control, blood, order, dinner. Kill word is state.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them again: daddy, mom, kids, hand, body, future, charge, question, message. Hmm. Maybe family-related? But \"daddy\" and \"mom\" are parents, \"kids\" are children. But the other words like hand, body, future, charge, question, message don't immediately fit. Maybe \"family\" is too broad and might hit the opponent's words like mother and father. Wait, the opponent has mother and father, so if I use \"family,\" that could be risky because the opponent's team has those words. So maybe avoid that.\n\nLooking for another angle. \"Hand\" and \"body\" are parts of the body. \"Message\" and \"question\" could relate to communication. \"Charge\" might mean to power up or to accuse. \"Future\" is time-related. \"Daddy,\" \"mom,\" \"kids\" are family terms. Maybe \"parent\" is too specific,",
