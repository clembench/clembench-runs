You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister.\nYour opponent's team words are: colonel, gold, bank, street, ladies, fun, couple, record.\nDistractor words are: bar, sir, mom, news, plane, country, order.\nThe kill words are: kind.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister. The opponent's words are colonel, gold, bank, street, ladies, fun, couple, record. Distractors are bar, sir, mom, news, plane, country, order. Kill word is kind.\n\nFirst, I should look for a common theme or connection among the team's words. Let's list them again: friend, difference, report, dad, accident, middle, drink, age, sister. Hmm. Maybe family? Dad and sister are family members. But friend isn't exactly family. Difference and middle... maybe not. Report and drink? Not obvious. Accident? Maybe not. Age could relate to family members' ages. Wait, maybe \"family\" is a possible clue? But the opponent has \"couple\" and \"ladies,\" which are also family-related. But maybe \"family\" could link dad, sister, friend (if friend is considered part of a family?), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe \"home\"? But not sure.\n\nAnother angle: \"report\" and \"news\" are distractors. Maybe \"media\"? But report is a team word. \"Report\" could be related to \"news,\" but \"news\" is a distractor. Hmm. \"Drink\"",
