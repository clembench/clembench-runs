You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: money, thanks, present, pleasure, cop, choice, bag, secret, service.\nYour opponent's team words are: job, music, baby, king, christmas, stuff, army, hell.\nDistractor words are: kind, end, way, sir, line, voice, sister.\nThe kill words are: boat.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are money, thanks, present, pleasure, cop, choice, bag, secret, service. The opponent's words are job, music, baby, king, christmas, stuff, army, hell. Distractors are kind, end, way, sir, line, voice, sister. Kill word is boat.\n\nFirst, I should look for a common theme or connection among the team's words. Let me list them again: money, thanks, present, pleasure, cop, choice, bag, secret, service. Hmm. Maybe \"gift\" could relate to present and maybe thanks? But \"gift\" is a distractor? Wait, no, the distractors are kind, end, way, sir, line, voice, sister. So \"gift\" isn't a distractor. But the clue can't be one of the team's words or parts of them. So \"present\" is a team word, so \"gift\" is okay as a clue if it relates to present and maybe others.\n\nWait, \"present\" can mean a gift or the current time. If I use \"gift\" as a clue, that would connect to \"present\". But are there other words that relate to \"gift\"? Maybe \"thanks\" because you say thanks when you receive a gift. \"Pleasure\" could be part of receiving",
