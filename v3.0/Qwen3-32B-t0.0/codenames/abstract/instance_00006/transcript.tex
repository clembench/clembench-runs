	 Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below. You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\\ \tt The goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\\ \tt The more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Always give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: <WORD>\\ \tt TARGETS: <TARGETS>\\ \tt \\ \tt Your team words are: merit, parallelism, expedience, impassion, superiority, imperativeness, interpretation, indecision, expertise.\\ \tt Your opponent's team words are: evasiveness, ineptitude, glorification, ethic, belief, unfaithfulness, cautiousness, deinstitutionalization.\\ \tt Distractor words are: bias, audacity, limitlessness, abolitionism, antihuman, despondency, heyday.\\ \tt The kill words are: implication.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are merit, parallelism, expedience, impassion, superiority, imperativeness, interpretation, indecision, expertise. The opponent's words are evasiveness, ineptitude, etc., and the distractors and kill words are listed too.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for a common theme or concept that connects several of my team's words. Let me list them again to see if any patterns emerge. Merit, parallelism, expedience, impassion, superiority, imperativeness, interpretation, indecision, expertise. \\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Merit and expertise both relate to skill or quality. Superiority and merit could be linked to being better. Expedience and imperativeness might relate to urgency or necessity. Impassion and interpretation could be about emotion or understanding. Parallelism is about similarity or structure. Indecision is about not making a choice. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe "urgency" could connect expedience and imperativeness. But does that link to others? Maybe not. Let's think of another angle. "Urgency" is a possible clue for expedience and imperativeness. But maybe "necessity" could work too. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "importance" might connect to merit, superiority, imperativeness. But does that link to others? Maybe. Let me check.
