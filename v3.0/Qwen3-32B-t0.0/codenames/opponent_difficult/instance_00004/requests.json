You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: robin, pumpkin, unicorn, sound, smuggler, grace, note, mercury, spider.\nYour opponent's team words are: match, stick, button, europe, ice, duck, contract, lab.\nDistractor words are: figure, drop, queen, bank, scorpion, hood, circle.\nThe kill words are: net.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are robin, pumpkin, unicorn, sound, smuggler, grace, note, mercury, spider. The opponent's words are match, stick, button, europe, ice, duck, contract, lab. Distractors are figure, drop, queen, bank, scorpion, hood, circle. Kill word is net.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them out again: robin, pumpkin, unicorn, sound, smuggler, grace, note, mercury, spider. Hmm. Maybe some of these are related to animals or mythical creatures? Robin is a bird, unicorn is mythical, spider is an arachnid. But that might be too broad. What about \"sound\"? Maybe music-related? Note is part of music. Grace could be a name or a concept. Smuggler is a person involved in illegal trade. Mercury is a planet or a metal. Pumpkin is a vegetable. \n\nWait, \"note\" and \"sound\" are directly related to music. Maybe \"grace\" could be part of a musical term, like \"grace note\"? That's a small note in music. So if I take note and grace, maybe the clue is \"music\"? But does that connect to others? Let's see. Mercury is the planet, but also the Roman god of",
