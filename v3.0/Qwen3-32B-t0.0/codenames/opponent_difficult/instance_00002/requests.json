You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: card, pass, spine, bug, school, bottle, mole, root, berry.\nYour opponent's team words are: cell, police, germany, beach, spring, fighter, mail, jupiter.\nDistractor words are: hospital, fall, embassy, fire, czech, box, wave.\nThe kill words are: belt.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: card, pass, spine, bug, school, bottle, mole, root, berry. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, I have to avoid the opponent's words and the distractors. The kill word is belt, so I need to make sure the clue doesn't accidentally lead to that.\n\nFirst, let me list out the team words again to see if there's a common theme. Card, pass, spine, bug, school, bottle, mole, root, berry. Hmm. Some of these are related to nature or biology. For example, spine is part of the body, root is a plant part, mole is an animal, bug is an insect, berry is a fruit. Maybe \"insect\" could be a clue, but bug is already a team word. Wait, the clue can't be a team word. So maybe \"insect\" relates to bug, but that's only one word. Not helpful enough.\n\nLooking at \"school\" – that could mean a group of fish, but maybe also a place of learning. \"Bottle\" and \"berry\" – maybe \"container\"? But bottle is a container, but berry isn't. Hmm. \"Mole\" could be a skin mole or the animal. \"Root\" is part of a plant. \"Pass\" could",
