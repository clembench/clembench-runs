You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: africa, button, swing, check, casino, spot, aztec, sock, model.\nYour opponent's team words are: pin, fish, shoe, piano, drill, mouse, undertaker, stick.\nDistractor words are: bill, dice, mine, mole, nurse, carrot, ray.\nThe kill words are: tube.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: africa, button, swing, check, casino, spot, aztec, sock, model. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, I have to avoid the opponent's words and the distractors. The kill word is tube, so I need to make sure that's not in the clue.\n\nFirst, let me look at the team words and see if there are any common themes or connections. Let's list them out again:\n\nAfrica, button, swing, check, casino, spot, Aztec, sock, model.\n\nHmm. Africa and Aztec are both related to cultures or regions. Button, sock, model... Maybe clothing? But model could also mean a type of representation. Casino and check might relate to gambling or games. Spot could be a place or a mark. Swing could be a dance or a movement. Check could also be a financial term. \n\nWait, \"check\" in a casino context might be a check for a win. \"Spot\" could be a place where you check something. \"Button\" might be part of a machine or a game. \"Swing\" could relate to a dance like the swing dance, which is associated with the 1920s-40s, maybe jazz, which is connected to casinos. \n\nAlternatively, \"model\" could be",
