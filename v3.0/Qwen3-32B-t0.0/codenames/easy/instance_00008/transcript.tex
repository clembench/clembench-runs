	 Provide one single-word clue that relates to some of your team's words from the list below. You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\\ \tt The goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\\ \tt The more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Always give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: <WORD>\\ \tt TARGETS: <TARGETS>\\ \tt \\ \tt Your team words are: car, egypt, lap, pipe, teacher, robin, triangle, comic, duck.\\ \tt Your opponent's team words are: suit, battery, snowman, doctor, light, state, charge, penguin.\\ \tt Distractor words are: copper, hand, bear, kangaroo, band, knight, arm.\\ \tt The kill words are: water.

The kill word is water, so I need to make sure my clue doesn't accidentally lead to that.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let me list out the team words again to see if there's a common theme or connection. Car, Egypt, lap, pipe, teacher, Robin, triangle, comic, duck. Hmm. Maybe some of these can be grouped. For example, "car" and "lap" could relate to racing or driving. "Egypt" might connect to something like pharaohs or pyramids. "Teacher" and "Robin" – maybe "Robin" as in the bird or the superhero? "Triangle" is a shape. "Comic" could be related to comics or funny. "Duck" is an animal. "Pipe" could be a musical instrument or a plumbing part. \\ \tt \\ \tt Looking for a common theme that connects multiple words. Let's see. Maybe "race"? Car and lap are both related to racing. But does that connect to others? Not sure. "Teacher" and "Robin" – maybe "teacher" as in a mentor, but not sure. "Comic"
