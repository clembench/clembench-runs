You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: server, school, hood, alien, knife, pole, figure, tube, oil.\nYour opponent's team words are: shoe, triangle, microscope, fish, turkey, whale, giant, strike.\nDistractor words are: octopus, revolution, agent, club, sock, smuggler, cold.\nThe kill words are: bat.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: server, school, hood, alien, knife, pole, figure, tube, oil. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, the clue has to be semantically related.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the team words again to see if there's a common theme or category. Server, school, hood... Hmm. Maybe \"server\" could relate to a computer server, but that might not connect to the others. \"School\" could be an educational institution. \"Hood\" might be part of a car or a person's clothing. \"Alien\" is an extraterrestrial. \"Knife\" is a weapon. \"Pole\" could be a vertical object. \"Figure\" could mean a person or a number. \"Tube\" is a cylindrical object. \"Oil\" is a liquid.\n\nLooking for connections. Maybe \"server\" and \"oil\" could relate to machinery or something technical. \"School\" and \"hood\" might be parts of a car? Wait, a car's engine has a hood, and maybe a server is part of a car's system? Not sure. Alternatively, \"server\" could be a person, like a waiter, but that might not help. \n\nAnother angle: \"Alien\" and \"figure\" could be part of a sci-fi theme. \"Knife",
