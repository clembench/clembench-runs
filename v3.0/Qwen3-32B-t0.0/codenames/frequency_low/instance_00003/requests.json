You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite.\nYour opponent's team words are: hurdler, assassinator, emotionality, liquidness, bagpiper, deinstitutionalization, housewifery, perpetration.\nDistractor words are: bandmaster, ladylove, customizer, defenseman, narrowness, hotelkeeper, neckband.\nThe kill words are: seacoast.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The words are eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite. The opponent's words and distractors are listed too, and there's a kill word.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections between the team words. Let me go through each one. Eggroll is a food, maybe Chinese. Scrubwoman could be a cleaning person. Plantain is another food, maybe a vegetable. Banquette is a type of seating, like in a restaurant. Muddiness is about being unclear or dirty. Unchallenging means easy. Moviemaker is someone who makes movies. Hypersensitivity is a medical term. Typewrite relates to typing.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a theme here. Let's see. Eggroll and plantain are both foods. Scrubwoman and moviemaker are professions or roles. Banquette is a place. Muddiness and hypersensitivity are states or conditions. Unchallenging is a descriptor. Typewrite is an action.\n\nWait, maybe \"typewrite\" and \"moviemaker\" could relate to \"media\" or \"entertainment\"? But that might not connect to the others. Or maybe \"typewrite\" and \"scrubwoman\" are both actions or roles",
