You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: hospital, mine, rock, play, satellite, tap, bear, atlantis, canada.\nYour opponent's team words are: shop, boom, palm, jet, spider, police, scientist, horseshoe.\nDistractor words are: snow, contract, yard, horse, plate, lab, bark, racket.\nThe kill words are: .<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are hospital, mine, rock, play, satellite, tap, bear, atlantis, canada. The opponent's words are shop, boom, palm, jet, spider, police, scientist, horseshoe. Distractors are snow, contract, yard, horse, plate, lab, bark, racket. Kill words are none listed.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them out again: hospital, mine, rock, play, satellite, tap, bear, atlantis, canada. Hmm. Are there any common themes or categories here? Let's see:\n\n- Hospital: related to health, medical, maybe emergency?\n- Mine: could be a mining operation or the verb \"to mine\" (extract resources)\n- Rock: could be a stone, music genre, or part of a band\n- Play: as in play music, play a game, or acting\n- Satellite: space, orbiting object\n- Tap: water tap, tap dance, or maybe a light touch\n- Bear: the animal, or to bear a burden\n- Atlantis: the mythical city\n- Canada: the country\n\nLooking for a common thread. Maybe \"mine\" and \"rock\" could relate to geology or minerals. \"Satellite\" and \"Canada\" might relate to space",
