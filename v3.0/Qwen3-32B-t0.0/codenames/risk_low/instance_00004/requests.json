You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: olympus, mouse, triangle, horseshoe, film, canada, millionaire, pitch, state.\nYour opponent's team words are: pupil, bug, hotel, button, straw, diamond, round, field.\nDistractor words are: mail, berlin, opera, club, cap, mine, web, train.\nThe kill words are: .<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are olympus, mouse, triangle, horseshoe, film, canada, millionaire, pitch, state. The opponent's words are pupil, bug, hotel, button, straw, diamond, round, field. Distractors are mail, berlin, opera, club, cap, mine, web, train. Kill words are none listed.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them out again: olympus, mouse, triangle, horseshoe, film, canada, millionaire, pitch, state. Hmm. Maybe some of these are related to shapes or symbols? For example, triangle is a shape, horseshoe is a symbol of luck. But how to connect others?\n\nOlympus is a mountain, but also part of Olympus Mons on Mars. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, Olympus could relate to Greek mythology. But how does that connect to the others? Maybe not. Let's think of other angles.\n\nMouse could be the computer mouse or the animal. If it's the computer mouse, maybe related to \"web\" or \"button,\" but those are distractors or opponent's words. Hmm. Alternatively, \"mouse\" as in the animal, but not sure.\n\nTriangle is a shape. Horseshoe is a shape too. Maybe \"shape\" is",
