You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: sound, revolution, plane, seal, light, file, ghost, bomb, gas.\nYour opponent's team words are: hawk, mount, war, orange, part, mint, ruler, grace.\nDistractor words are: ground, microscope, alien, witch, washer, china, pyramid, plot.\nThe kill words are: .<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: sound, revolution, plane, seal, light, file, ghost, bomb, gas. The clue can't be one of the words themselves or part of them. Let me think about possible connections.\n\nFirst, \"sound\" and \"light\" are both types of waves. Maybe \"wave\"? But does that connect to others? \"Revolution\" could be a political revolution, but maybe \"wave\" as in a wave of change? Hmm. \"Plane\" could be an airplane, but maybe \"wave\" isn't the best fit. \"Seal\" could be a seal as in a closure, but maybe \"wave\" doesn't connect. \"File\" as in a document, maybe not. \"Ghost\" could be a spirit, but maybe not. \"Bomb\" and \"gas\" are both explosive or harmful substances. Maybe \"explosive\"? But \"explosive\" might connect to bomb and gas, but not the others. \n\nWait, \"revolution\" could also mean a rotation, like a full circle. Maybe \"cycle\"? But does that connect to others? \"Sound\" and \"light\" are both forms of energy. Maybe \"energy\"? But again, not sure about the others. \"Plane\" could be a flat surface, but maybe not. \"Seal\" as in a stamp? Maybe \"imprint",
