You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: glass, fork, cat, screen, pound, witch, shoe, india, genius.\nYour opponent's team words are: aztec, whip, staff, band, stadium, robin, chair, ray.\nDistractor words are: row, scientist, match, cotton, dress, fire, king, buffalo.\nThe kill words are: .<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words: glass, fork, cat, screen, pound, witch, shoe, india, genius. The clue can't be any of those words or parts of them. Also, the clue has to be semantically related.\n\nFirst, let me list out the team words again to see if there's a common theme or connection. Glass, fork, cat, screen, pound, witch, shoe, India, genius. Hmm. Let's think about each word and possible associations.\n\nGlass could relate to something like \"window\" or \"fragile,\" but maybe not. Fork is a utensil, but maybe \"prong\" or \"split.\" Cat is an animal. Screen could be a TV, monitor, or maybe \"filter.\" Pound is a unit of weight or a currency. Witch is a magical figure. Shoe is footwear. India is a country. Genius is a person of high intelligence.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Maybe \"India\" and \"genius\" are a bit tricky. Let's see if there's a category that includes some of these. For example, \"screen\" and \"glass\" could be related to technology or devices. \"Fork\" and \"shoe\" might be household items. \"Cat\" and \"witch\" could be related to animals or fantasy. \"Pound\" as a unit or currency. \n\nWait",
