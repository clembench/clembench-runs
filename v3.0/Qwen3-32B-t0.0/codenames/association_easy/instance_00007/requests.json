You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey.\nYour opponent's team words are: ska, tequila, wine, alternative, martini, kale, zucchini, rock.\nDistractor words are: guitar, plum, lime, banana, apricot, cello, harmonica.\nThe kill words are: hiv.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey. The opponent's words are ska, tequila, wine, etc., and there are distractors and a kill word.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes or categories that connect multiple team words. Let's list them again: skiing, jacks, socks, bronze, vest, platinum, train, gun, hockey. \n\nSkiing and hockey are sports. Jacks is a game, maybe? Socks and vest are clothing items. Bronze and platinum are metals. Train is a vehicle. Gun is a weapon. Hmm. Maybe there's a connection between metals and something else. Bronze and platinum are both metals, maybe related to medals? Like Olympic medals? But then, skiing and hockey are Olympic sports. So maybe \"Olympic\" could be a clue? Let's check: Olympic relates to skiing (yes), hockey (yes), and maybe the medals (bronze, platinum). But wait, Olympic medals are gold, silver, bronze. Platinum isn't an Olympic medal. So maybe that's not the right angle.\n\nAnother angle: \"train\" could be part of a train station, but not sure. \"Vest\" and \"socks\" are clothing. Maybe \"clothing\" as a clue?",
