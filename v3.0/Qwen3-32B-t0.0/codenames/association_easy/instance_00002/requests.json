You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: club, suv, van, measles, aids, sword, scooter, flu, gun.\nYour opponent's team words are: minister, imam, plum, silver, archbishop, tangerine, copper, reverend.\nDistractor words are: violet, spade, italy, portugal, shears, indigo, gold.\nThe kill words are: mechanic.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are club, suv, van, measles, aids, sword, scooter, flu, gun. The opponent's words are minister, imam, plum, silver, archbishop, tangerine, copper, reverend. Distractors are violet, spade, italy, portugal, shears, indigo, gold. Kill word is mechanic.\n\nFirst, I should look for common themes among the team's words. Let's list them out again: club, SUV, van, measles, AIDS, sword, scooter, flu, gun. Hmm. These seem to be a mix of vehicles (club could be a social club, but maybe not), diseases (measles, AIDS, flu), weapons (sword, gun), and vehicles again (SUV, van, scooter). Maybe there's a category that connects some of these. \n\nLooking for a common theme. Diseases and weapons? Not sure. Vehicles and weapons? Maybe not. What about \"infection\" for the diseases? But that only covers measles, AIDS, flu. Maybe \"illness\"? But again, same issue. Alternatively, \"transportation\" for the vehicles (SUV, van, scooter), but club and sword don't fit. \n\nWait, maybe \"weapon\" could link sword and gun. But that's only two words",
