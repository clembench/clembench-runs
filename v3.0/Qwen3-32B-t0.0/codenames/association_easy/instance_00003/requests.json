You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: back, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda.\nYour opponent's team words are: copper, fist, titanium, sheep, horse, grenade, steel, bronze.\nDistractor words are: car, trailer, aluminum, oxygen, cave, dill, sage.\nThe kill words are: walnut.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are back, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda. The opponent's words are copper, fist, titanium, sheep, horse, grenade, steel, bronze. Distractors are car, trailer, aluminum, oxygen, cave, dill, sage. Kill word is walnut.\n\nFirst, I should look for a common theme among the team's words. Let's list them out again: back, scooter, bus, RV, head, ankle, rat, cottonmouth, anaconda. Hmm. Maybe some of these are related to vehicles or transportation? Bus, scooter, RV. But then there's also body parts like back, head, ankle. Wait, cottonmouth is a snake, anaconda is another snake, and rat is an animal. Maybe \"animal\" is a clue? But then there's also the vehicles. Alternatively, maybe \"vehicle\" could be a clue for bus, scooter, RV. But the clue has to relate to multiple words. Let's see. If I take \"vehicle\" as the clue, it would cover bus, scooter, RV. That's three words. But maybe there's a better clue that connects more words. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the words again: back, head, ankle – these are body parts. So maybe \"",
