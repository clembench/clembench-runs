You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: cottonmouth, coral, rat, major, stomach, nose, private, knee, admiral.\nYour opponent's team words are: nephew, copper, grandfather, watermelon, platinum, blackberry, brother, peach.\nDistractor words are: swan, ostrich, jade, onyx, pearl, goose, finch.\nThe kill words are: chapel.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are cottonmouth, coral, rat, major, stomach, nose, private, knee, admiral. The opponent's words are nephew, copper, grandfather, watermelon, platinum, blackberry, brother, peach. Distractors are swan, ostrich, jade, onyx, pearl, goose, finch. Kill word is chapel.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among my team's words. Let's list them out again. Cottonmouth is a type of snake. Coral is related to the sea or marine life. Rat is an animal. Major, private, and admiral are military ranks. Stomach, nose, knee are body parts. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a connection between the military ranks. Major, private, admiral. Those are all ranks in the military. So maybe the clue could be \"military\". Let me check if that connects to any other words. The other words like cottonmouth, coral, etc., don't seem to relate to military. So maybe the clue \"military\" would target major, private, admiral. That's three words. But maybe there's a better clue that connects more words.\n\nLooking at body parts: stomach, nose, knee. Maybe \"body\" as a clue. But that's three words. Alternatively, maybe \"anatomy",
