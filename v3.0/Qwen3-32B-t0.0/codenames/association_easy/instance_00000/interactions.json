You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: australia, goat, watermelon, lion, korea, iran, bear, plum, moose.\nYour opponent's team words are: mosquito, hotel, flood, clouds, mansion, wasp, shack, cottage.\nDistractor words are: whisk, missile, barbie, spatula, machete, blocks, yoyo.\nThe kill words are: parakeet.",

Also, I want to maximize the number of target words the clue connects to, but it has to be semantically related.\n\nFirst, let me list out the team words again. Australia, Korea, Iran are countries. Goat, lion, bear, moose are animals. Watermelon and plum are fruits. Hmm. Maybe there's a category that overlaps. Wait, some of these are animals, but maybe there's a common theme. Let me think. Are there any other connections? Like, maybe some of these are in a specific context, like in a zoo? But that might be too broad. Or maybe they are all found in certain regions? For example, Australia has unique animals like kangaroos, but we have a goat here. Not sure. \n\nWait, maybe \"wildlife\" could be a clue? Because goat, lion, bear, moose are all wild animals. But then, what about the other words? Australia, Korea, Iran are countries, but maybe they have wildlife too. But the clue would need to connect to as many as possible.
