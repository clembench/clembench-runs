You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum.\nYour opponent's team words are: scotland, brandy, poland, canada, india, vodka, poplar, oak.\nDistractor words are: running, river, mesa, track, skiing, glacier, cave.\nThe kill words are: dresser.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum. The opponent's words are scotland, brandy, etc., and there are distractors and a kill word.\n\nFirst, I should look for a common theme among the team's words. Let me list them again: teeth, kidney, violin, archbishop, elbow, deacon, cymbal, chest, drum. Hmm. Some of these are body parts (teeth, kidney, elbow, chest). Others are musical instruments (violin, cymbal, drum). Then there are religious titles (archbishop, deacon). Maybe there's a way to connect these different categories with a single clue.\n\nWait, maybe \"body parts\" and \"musical instruments\" can be linked through something like \"parts\" or \"components.\" But the clue can't be one of the words in the list. Let me think. Another angle: some of these words can be parts of a larger system. For example, a violin is part of an orchestra, but that's not helpful. Or maybe \"organ\" as in body organs (kidney, teeth, chest, elbow) and musical organs (like a pipe organ, but violin, cymbal, drum are not organs). Wait, but \"organ",
