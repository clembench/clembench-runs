You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: cameraman, skillet, raincoat, malaria, prairie, spider, libido, outburst, bartender.\nYour opponent's team words are: fiesta, checkup, ignorance, unicorn, vandalism, overcoat, humility, goldfish.\nDistractor words are: tactic, saliva, astronaut, migraine, geisha, rum, cactus.\nThe kill words are: fuzz.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are cameraman, skillet, raincoat, malaria, prairie, spider, libido, outburst, bartender. The opponent's words are fiesta, checkup, etc., and there are distractors and kill words.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team words. Let's list them again: cameraman, skillet, raincoat, malaria, prairie, spider, libido, outburst, bartender. Hmm. Are there any common themes? Maybe not obvious. Let's think about each word's possible associations.\n\nCameraman is related to photography or cameras. Skillet is a pan, cooking. Raincoat is for rain. Malaria is a disease. Prairie is a grassland. Spider is an arachnid. Libido is sexual desire. Outburst is an emotional reaction. Bartender is someone who serves drinks.\n\nLooking for a common theme. Maybe \"outdoor\" or \"nature\"? Prairie is outdoors, but others like cameraman and bartender might not fit. Alternatively, maybe \"tools\" or \"items\"? Skillet and raincoat are items. But others like spider and malaria are living things or diseases. Maybe \"insects\"? Spider is an arachnid, but maybe related to insects. Malaria is caused by a mosquito, which is an insect. But how to connect that to other",
