You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: godmother, nephew, allergy, ordinance, oven, hypocrite, geisha, vigilante, storeroom.\nYour opponent's team words are: libido, blazer, bedroom, mutt, tanker, ledger, seminary, vandalism.\nDistractor words are: riddance, sorcerer, spider, checkup, teacher, ruse, courtroom.\nThe kill words are: census.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are godmother, nephew, allergy, ordinance, oven, hypocrite, geisha, vigilante, storeroom. The opponent's words are libido, blazer, bedroom, mutt, tanker, ledger, seminary, vandalism. Distractors are riddance, sorcerer, spider, checkup, teacher, ruse, courtroom. Kill word is census.\n\nFirst, I should look for connections among the team's words. Let's list them out again:\n\n- godmother: a godparent, part of a family or religious role.\n- nephew: a relative, family member.\n- allergy: medical condition, reaction to something.\n- ordinance: a law or regulation.\n- oven: kitchen appliance.\n- hypocrite: someone who pretends to be something they're not.\n- geisha: traditional Japanese entertainer.\n- vigilante: someone who takes the law into their own hands.\n- storeroom: a room for storage.\n\nLooking for common themes. Maybe family? Godmother and nephew are family terms. But the others don't fit. Allergy is medical, ordinance is legal, oven is kitchen, hypocrite is a person type, geisha is cultural, vigilante is law enforcement, storeroom is a place.\n\nAnother angle: maybe roles or positions. Godmother is a role,",
