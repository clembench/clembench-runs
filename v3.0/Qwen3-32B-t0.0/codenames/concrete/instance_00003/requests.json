You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: eyeball, donkey, vodka, birdseed, warthog, cookie, paperclip, marbles, clay.\nYour opponent's team words are: shawl, goalpost, backpack, croissant, switchblade, horn, bikini, sandcastle.\nDistractor words are: armchair, hubcap, confetti, saltshaker, cauliflower, underwear, donut.\nThe kill words are: walnut.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to come up with a single-word clue that relates to some of my team's words. The team words are eyeball, donkey, vodka, birdseed, warthog, cookie, paperclip, marbles, clay. The opponent's words and distractors are other things, and there's a kill word walnut.\n\nFirst, I should look for a common theme or connection among the team's words. Let me list them again: eyeball, donkey, vodka, birdseed, warthog, cookie, paperclip, marbles, clay. Hmm. Are there any obvious categories here? Maybe some are animals? Donkey, warthog, maybe birdseed relates to birds. But birdseed is a food. Vodka is a drink. Cookie is a food. Paperclip, marbles, clay, eyeball, and donkey. Not sure yet.\n\nWait, maybe some of these can be associated with \"toys\" or \"objects\"? Marbles are a toy. Paperclip is an office supply. Clay can be used for modeling, like playdough. Cookie could be a toy in a cookie jar? Not sure. Maybe \"game\"? Marbles are part of a game. But not sure about others.\n\nAnother angle: parts of the body? Eyeball is a body part. Donkey is an animal. Vodka is a drink. Birdseed is for birds. Warthog",
