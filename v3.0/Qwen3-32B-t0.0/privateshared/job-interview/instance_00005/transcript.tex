The CV mentions "BACHELOR: Engineering" and "HIGHEST-EDUCATION: Bachelor". So the information is there. The user specified that the recruiter doesn't know yet, but the CV includes the degree. Since the question is about the interviewer's knowledge, and the CV has the details, the answer should be yes. But wait, the user said the recruiter doesn't know yet. Hmm, maybe the CV hasn't been shared yet. Wait, the initial setup says the recruiter doesn't know yet. So even though the CV has the info, the interviewer hasn't seen it. So the answer would be no. Wait, but the user is asking if the interviewer knows. If the CV hasn't been provided yet, then the interviewer doesn't know. The user's instruction says the recruiter doesn't know yet. So the answer is no. But the CV includes the bachelor's degree. But since the recruiter hasn't seen it, the answer is no. So the correct answer is no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ASIDE: No.

But the CV is part of the job application, so if the recruiter is reviewing the CV, they would know. But the initial setup says the recruiter doesn't know yet. So maybe the answer is no.
