The questioner doesn't know about the arrangement yet because the initial message says they don't know things are in different places. So, since the questioner hasn't been told about the piano being on the left, they don't know. The answer should be no. I need to make sure I'm not missing any details. The key point is that the questioner's knowledge is limited until they ask questions. So the answer is definitely no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: No.
