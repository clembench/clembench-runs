The questioner's knowledge is limited to what they've been told. The initial setup says the questioner doesn't know things are in different places yet. But the LEFT is specified as carbon. However, the question is whether the questioner knows that. Since the scenario states that the questioner doesn't know about the different placements yet, they probably haven't been informed about the LEFT being carbon. So the answer should be no. I need to make sure I'm not missing any other clues. The answer should be straightforward: no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt ANSWER: No.
