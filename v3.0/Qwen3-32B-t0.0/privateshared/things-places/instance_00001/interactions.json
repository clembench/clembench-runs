The questioner's knowledge is limited to what they've been told. The initial situation says the questioner doesn't know things are in different places yet. But the LEFT is explicitly listed as books.

But the initial statement says the questioner doesn't know about the different places yet. Wait, maybe the questioner hasn't been told the positions yet. Wait, the initial message starts with \"Here is the situation:\" and lists all the positions. So the questioner has been given that information.
