So the agent isn't aware of any details, including the departure place. The question is specifically about the departure place, which is Paris. Since the agent doesn't know anything yet, the answer should be no. The user wants a yes or no answer followed by a stop, so I need to make sure it's just "No" and then stop. No extra sentences. Let me confirm again: the agent is not aware, so the answer is no.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt No.
