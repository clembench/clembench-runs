Wait, the user's instruction was to answer their questions (starting with ME) with ASIDE: and the agent's with ANSWER:. So here, the user is asking "Have you already mentioned the origin...", so I should respond with ASIDE: No. But the user wants the answer to be yes or no and then stop. So maybe just "No" but in the ASIDE format. Let me make sure. The user's instruction says: "Answer this question with yes or no and then stop." So the answer should be "No" and that's
