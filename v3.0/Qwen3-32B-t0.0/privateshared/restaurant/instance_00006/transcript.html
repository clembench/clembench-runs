        <p>You are a customer in a restaurant.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is asking if I&#x27;ve told the waiter about the appetizers.

The user&#x27;s question is whether I&#x27;ve told the waiter about the appetizers. Since the initial setup states the waiter is unaware, the answer should be no.

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, the user is asking if I&#x27;ve told the waiter about the appetizers. Let me check the previous messages.<br/><br/>In the initial setup, the user provided a list of what they want to order, including the appetizer Hummus. The scenario says the waiter doesn&#x27;t know yet. The user&#x27;s first message sets up the order, and the waiter hasn&#x27;t been informed. The user&#x27;s current question is asking if I (the assistant) have told the waiter about the appetizers. Since the scenario states the waiter doesn&#x27;t know yet, the answer should be no. The user wants a direct yes or no answer followed by a stop. So the correct response is &quot;No.&quot; and then stop. I need to make sure not to add anything else. The aside part is for when the user asks their own questions, but here the user is asking a ME question, so the answer should be in the specified format. Let me confirm again: the user&#x27;s order hasn&#x27;t been communicated to the waiter yet, so the answer is no.<br/>&lt;/think&gt;<br/><br/>No.</p>
