The target word is \"least,\" and the related words are \"amount,\" \"most,\" and \"little.\" I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants. \n\nFirst, \"least\" is the opposite of \"most,\" so maybe I can hint at that. But since \"most\" is a related word, I can't mention it directly. Hmm. Maybe I can say something like \"the smallest quantity\" but wait, \"quantity\" is similar to \"amount,\" which is a related word. So that's out.\n\nWhat about using a context where \"least\" is commonly used? Like in comparisons. For example, \"the smallest number in a comparison.\" But \"smallest\" might be okay as long as it's not the related words. Wait, \"little\" is a related word, so \"smallest\" is a variant? Maybe. The user said not to use parts or morphological variants. \"Smallest\" is a form of \"small,\" which isn't in the related words. So maybe that's safe.\n\nAnother angle: \"least\" can mean the minimum. So \"minimum value\" but \"value\" might be too vague. Or \"the bottom of a scale.\" That could work. Let me check if that's using any forbidden words. \"Scale\" isn't related. \n\nAlternatively, think of a sentence where \"least\" is used. Like \"She",
