	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "woman," and I need to describe it without using "woman," "female," "girl," or "lady." Hmm. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe something about being an adult female human? But I can't use "female." How about roles or characteristics? Like, someone who can be a mother, or a person who works? Wait, that might be too vague. Or maybe something about clothing? Like "she" or pronouns? No, that's too indirect. Maybe occupations? "A person who..." but that's too broad. Wait, maybe "adult female human" but without using the forbidden words. Oh, maybe "an adult female human being." But "female" is a related word. Oh right, I can't use that either. So maybe "an adult human of the female gender." No, "female" is still there. Hmm. Maybe "a grown-up female human." No, same problem. What else? Maybe think of roles like "mother," "sister," but that might not be enough. Or maybe "a person who is not a man." But that implies gender. Wait, but "man" is allowed? The target word is "woman," so using "man" is okay? The related words are female, girl, lady. So "man" isn't in the list, so maybe I can use that. So "Someone
