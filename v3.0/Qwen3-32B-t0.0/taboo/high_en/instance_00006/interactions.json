Let me think about the different meanings of \"reach.\" It can mean to get to a place, like reaching a destination. Or it can mean the ability to touch something, like reaching for an object. Also, there's the metaphorical sense, like the reach of a company's influence.\n\nFirst, I need to find synonyms or related concepts that aren't the forbidden words. Let's brainstorm. For the physical aspect: getting to a point, arriving, touching. For the metaphorical: influence, scope, range. But I have to avoid \"distance\" and \"stretch.\" Maybe \"arrive at a destination\" or \"touch something from a distance.\" Wait, \"distance\" is a related word, so I can't use that. So maybe \"arrive at a place\" or \"get to a location.\" \n\nAnother angle: \"reach\" can be about the hand or arm extending, but I can't use \"extend\" or \"stretch.\" So maybe \"outstretched hand\" but again, \"stretch\" is related. Hmm. Maybe \"the act of getting to something\" or \"the ability to touch something far away.\" But need to be concise. \n\nWhat about examples? Like \"reach the top\" or \"reach a goal.\" But how to describe it without",
