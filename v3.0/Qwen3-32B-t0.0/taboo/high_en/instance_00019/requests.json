The target word is \"late,\" and I need to describe it without using \"late,\" \"slow,\" \"delay,\" or \"early.\" Hmm. Let me think about the different meanings of \"late.\" It can mean not on time, like arriving after the expected time. But I can't use \"delay\" or \"slow.\" Maybe I can use synonyms or related concepts.\n\nAnother meaning of \"late\" is the opposite of \"early,\" but since \"early\" is a related word, I can't mention that either. Maybe I can describe the consequence of being late, like missing something. For example, \"arriving after the scheduled time.\" But I need to be careful not to use any forbidden words.\n\nWait, \"scheduled\" might be okay. Let me think of another angle. If someone is late, they might be considered as having a habit of not being punctual. Maybe I can say \"not punctual.\" But \"punctual\" is a bit close to \"on time,\" which might be acceptable. Let me check if \"punctual\" is a variant of the target word. No, it's a different word. So maybe \"not punctual\" is a good clue.\n\nAlternatively, \"after the expected time\" could work. But \"expected\" might be too vague. Let me try to make it concise. \"Arriving after the scheduled time.\" That's a direct description without using the forbidden words.",
