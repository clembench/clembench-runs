Let me think about the different meanings of \"late.\" It can mean not on time, like arriving after the expected time. But I can't use \"delay\" or \"slow.\" Maybe I can use synonyms or related concepts.\n\nAnother meaning of \"late\" is the opposite of \"early,\" but since \"early\" is a related word, I can't mention that either. Maybe I can describe the consequence of being late, like missing something. For example, \"arriving after the scheduled time.\" But I need to be careful not to use any forbidden words.\n\nWait, \"scheduled\" might be okay. Let me think of another angle. If someone is late, they might be considered as having a habit of not being punctual. Maybe I can say \"not punctual.\" But \"punctual\" is a bit close to \"on time,\" which might be acceptable. Let me check if \"punctual\" is a variant of the target word. No, it's a different word. So maybe \"not punctual\" is a good clue.\n\nAlternatively, \"after the expected time\" could work. But \"expected\" might be too vague. Let me try to make it concise. \"Arriving after the scheduled time.\" That's a direct description without using the forbidden words.",
