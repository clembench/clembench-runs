	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt late\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - slow\\ \tt - delay\\ \tt - early\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "late," and I need to describe it without using "late," "slow," "delay," or "early." Hmm. Let me think about the different meanings of "late." It can mean not on time, like arriving after the expected time. But I can't use "delay" or "slow." Maybe I can use synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another meaning of "late" is the opposite of "early," but since "early" is a related word, I can't mention that either. Maybe I can describe the consequence of being late, like missing something. For example, "arriving after the scheduled time." But I need to be careful not to use any forbidden words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "scheduled" might be okay. Let me think of another angle. If someone is late, they might be considered as having a habit of not being punctual. Maybe I can say "not punctual." But "punctual" is a bit close to "on time," which might be acceptable. Let me check if "punctual" is a variant of the target word. No, it's a different word. So maybe "not punctual" is a good clue.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "after the expected time" could work. But "expected" might be too vague. Let me try to make it concise. "Arriving after the scheduled time." That's a direct description without using the forbidden words.
