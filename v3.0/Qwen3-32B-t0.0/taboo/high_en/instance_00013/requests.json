The target word is \"marine,\" and I need to describe it without using that word or the related ones: aquatic, nautical, oceangoing. Hmm. Marine relates to the sea, right? So maybe I can talk about things connected to the ocean. But I can't use \"aquatic,\" which is a direct synonym. What else? Maybe mention creatures that live in the sea. Or something about ships or sailors? Wait, \"nautical\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. Oceangoing refers to ships that travel across oceans, so I need to avoid that too.\n\nLet me think of synonyms for marine. Maybe \"related to the ocean\" but I can't use \"ocean\" directly? Or maybe \"underwater\" but that's part of aquatic. Wait, \"marine\" can also refer to the military branch, like Marines. But the user probably means the adjective related to the sea. Let me try to describe it as \"pertaining to the sea or sea life.\" But I need to avoid the related words. Maybe I can say \"connected to the sea and its creatures.\" Wait, does that use any forbidden terms? The target word is \"marine,\" so I can't use that. The related words are aquatic, nautical, oceangoing. So \"sea\" is okay. Let me try: \"CLUE: Relating to the sea and its",
