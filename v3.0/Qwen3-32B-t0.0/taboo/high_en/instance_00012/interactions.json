What are the key characteristics of a wing? It's part of a bird or airplane, used for movement through the air. But I can't mention bird or fly. Maybe talk about the shape or function. Like, \"flat surface that helps move through air.\" Wait, but \"move through air\" might be too close to \"fly.\" Maybe \"used for gliding\" or \"lifting.\" Also, airplanes have wings. So maybe mention both birds and planes but without naming them. Like \"structure on birds and planes that helps them stay aloft.\" But \"aloft\" might be too similar to \"fly.\" Alternatively, \"part that allows for air travel.\" Hmm. Or think about the shape: \"flat, extended part attached to the back of something.\" Maybe \"used to generate lift.\" That's more technical. Let me check the related words again. Can't use feather, fly, bird. So maybe \"aircraft and avian appendage for movement.\" But \"avian\" is related to birds. Maybe too close. Let's try: \"Flat structure that helps in moving through the air, found on both planes and certain animals.\" But \"certain animals\" might hint at birds. Alternatively, \"part that provides lift for flight.\" Wait, \"flight\" is related",
