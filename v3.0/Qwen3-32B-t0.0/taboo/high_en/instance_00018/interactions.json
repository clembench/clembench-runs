The target word is \"must,\" and the related words are \"should,\" \"essential,\" and \"have.\" I need to describe \"must\" without using those words or any of their forms. Hmm.\n\nFirst, \"must\" can mean necessity, like something required. But I can't use \"have to\" because \"have\" is a related word. Maybe I can say \"absolute requirement\" but \"essential\" is related, so that's out. How about \"mandatory\"? Wait, \"mandatory\" might be okay. Or maybe \"obligatory\"? Let me check if those are related. The related words are should, essential, have. So \"mandatory\" isn't in the list. Maybe \"something that's unavoidable\"? But \"unavoidable\" might be too vague. Alternatively, think of examples. Like, \"You must do this\" is a strong command. Maybe \"a strong obligation\" but \"obligation\" could be okay. Wait, but \"must\" is a modal verb. How else can I describe it? Maybe \"a command that leaves no choice.\" Or \"a strict necessity.\" Let me make sure I don't use any of the related words. \"Strict necessity\" might work. Let me check: \"essential\" is related, but \"necessity\" is a different form? Wait, the rules say you can't use parts or morphological variants. \"Necessity\" is a variant",
