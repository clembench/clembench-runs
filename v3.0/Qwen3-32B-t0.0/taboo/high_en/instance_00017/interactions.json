Let me think about what \"pricing\" means. It's about setting the amount of money for something, right? So maybe I can talk about determining how much something is worth in terms of money.\n\nBut wait, I can't use \"value\" or \"cost.\" So maybe I can say something like \"determining the money amount for a product.\" But \"product\" might be too specific. The related words don't include product, but maybe I can use a more general term. How about \"setting the monetary amount for goods or services\"? That avoids the related words. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the process of deciding how much to charge for something.\" That seems good. Let me check if \"charge\" is a related word. No, the related words are evaluation, cost, value. So that's safe. Another angle: \"the act of assigning a price tag to items.\" But \"price tag\" might be too specific. Maybe \"assigning a monetary value\" but \"value\" is a related word. Oh, right, so I can't use \"value.\" \n\nSo perhaps \"the method of determining how much to ask for something.\" \"Ask\" might be okay. Let me make sure. The key is to avoid the target word and related words. Let me",
