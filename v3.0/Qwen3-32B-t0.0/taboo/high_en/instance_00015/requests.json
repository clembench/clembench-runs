The target word is \"guard,\" and the related words are security, protect, and defend. I need to describe \"guard\" without using those words or any of their forms. Hmm.\n\nFirst, think about synonyms for guard that aren't in the related list. Words like watch, keep, or maybe sentinel? But I can't use those if they're related. Wait, \"sentinel\" is a type of guard, but maybe that's too close. Let me think of a scenario where someone is guarding something. Like a person standing watch, or keeping an eye on something. Maybe \"person who watches over a place at night\"? But I need to be concise.\n\nAlso, avoid using \"protect\" or \"defend.\" Maybe use action verbs. \"Stands vigil\" or \"keeps watch.\" How about \"CLUE: Person who keeps watch over a location or event.\" That doesn't use the forbidden words. Let me check: \"guard\" isn't there, nor are security, protect, defend. That seems safe. Maybe that's a good first clue. Let me make sure there's no morphological variant, like \"protection\" or \"defender.\" No, the clue is okay. Alright, go with that.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: Person who keeps watch over a location or event.<|im_end|>",
