The target word is \"tea,\" and I need to describe it without using \"tea,\" any parts of it, or related words like coffee, caffeine, or brew. Hmm. Let me think about the characteristics of tea. It's a drink made from leaves, usually hot. But I can't say \"leaves\" because that's part of the word? Wait, no, \"tea\" isn't made from leaves directly, but the leaves are processed. Wait, maybe \"steeped leaves\"? But \"brew\" is a related word and is prohibited. Oh right, so I can't use \"brew.\" So maybe \"steeped in hot water\"? But how to phrase that without using related terms. Let's see. Maybe \"hot beverage made by steeping leaves.\" Wait, but \"steep\" might be part of \"brew\"? No, \"steep\" is a different word. Wait, but \"brew\" is a related word here, so I can't use that. So \"steep\" is allowed? Because \"brew\" is a related word, but \"steep\" isn't. Let me check. The related words are coffee, caffeine, brew. So \"steep\" is okay. So maybe \"hot drink made by steeping leaves.\" That should work. Let me make sure I didn't use any forbidden words. Target word is \"tea,\" so the clue can't include \"tea,\"",
