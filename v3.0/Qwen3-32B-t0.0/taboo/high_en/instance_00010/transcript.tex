	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt attack\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - war\\ \tt - fight\\ \tt - strike\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "attack," and I need to describe it without using "attack," "war," "fight," or "strike." Hmm. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe something like "assault," but that's a variant of "attack," so probably not allowed. What about actions that lead to an attack? Like "launch a military operation"? Wait, "military" might be okay. Or "initiate a hostile action." But "hostile" might be too close. How about "begin a conflict"? But "conflict" is similar to "war." Maybe "aggression." Wait, "aggression" is a related concept. Let me check if that's a related word. The related words given are war, fight, strike. So "aggression" might be allowed. So maybe "CLUE: Begin with aggression." Wait, but "begin" is part of it. Or "Start of a conflict." But "conflict" is similar to war. Maybe "Offensive move." "Offensive" could work. Let me think. "CLUE: First move in a battle." But "battle" is similar to fight. Hmm. Maybe "Initiate a strike." Wait, "strike" is a related word. Can't use that. How about "Launch an offensive." "Launch" is okay. "Offensive" is part of it. Maybe that's acceptable
