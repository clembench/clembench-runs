	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "just," and the related words are barely, fair, and equitable. I need to describe "just" without using those words or their variants. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, think about the different meanings of "just." It can mean fair, but that's a related word. So maybe the temporal meaning, like "just now" or "just a minute." Or the legal meaning, like "justice." Wait, but "fair" is related, so I can't use that. Maybe think of a situation where something happened very recently. Like "merely" or "only," but "barely" is a related word. Oh, right, "just" can mean "only" as in "I just did that." But I can't use "only" if it's a variant. Wait, the rules say not to use parts or morphological variants. So "only" is a different word, but maybe it's too close? Maybe safer to avoid.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: in a legal context, like a judge making a decision. But "fair" and "equitable" are related, so I can't mention those. Maybe "right" as in correct, but "right" could be part of "just right," but that's a different meaning. Or think of "just" in the sense of "exactly," like "just enough." But how to describe that without using the related words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait
