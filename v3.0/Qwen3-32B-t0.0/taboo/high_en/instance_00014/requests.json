The target word is \"just,\" and the related words are barely, fair, and equitable. I need to describe \"just\" without using those words or their variants. Hmm.\n\nFirst, think about the different meanings of \"just.\" It can mean fair, but that's a related word. So maybe the temporal meaning, like \"just now\" or \"just a minute.\" Or the legal meaning, like \"justice.\" Wait, but \"fair\" is related, so I can't use that. Maybe think of a situation where something happened very recently. Like \"merely\" or \"only,\" but \"barely\" is a related word. Oh, right, \"just\" can mean \"only\" as in \"I just did that.\" But I can't use \"only\" if it's a variant. Wait, the rules say not to use parts or morphological variants. So \"only\" is a different word, but maybe it's too close? Maybe safer to avoid.\n\nAnother angle: in a legal context, like a judge making a decision. But \"fair\" and \"equitable\" are related, so I can't mention those. Maybe \"right\" as in correct, but \"right\" could be part of \"just right,\" but that's a different meaning. Or think of \"just\" in the sense of \"exactly,\" like \"just enough.\" But how to describe that without using the related words.\n\nWait",
