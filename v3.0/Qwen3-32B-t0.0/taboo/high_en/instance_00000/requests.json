The target word is \"away,\" and I need to describe it without using \"away,\" \"gone,\" \"distance,\" or \"here.\" Hmm. Let me think about the meaning of \"away.\" It usually means in the opposite direction from a place, or not present. Maybe I can use examples or related concepts.\n\nFirst, maybe think of synonyms. Like \"far,\" but \"distance\" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about \"opposite of here\"? Wait, \"here\" is a related word too. So I can't mention that. Maybe \"not here.\" But that's using \"here,\" which is forbidden. So that's out.\n\nAnother angle: when you say something is \"away,\" like \"the ball is away.\" Maybe use a scenario. Like \"opposite of nearby.\" But \"nearby\" isn't a related word. Wait, but \"distance\" is related, so maybe avoid that. How about \"opposite of close\"? That might work. Let me check. If I say \"opposite of close,\" does that point to \"away\"? Maybe. But the player might think of \"far,\" but \"far\" is a related word? No, the related words are gone, distance, here. So \"far\" is allowed. Wait, but \"distance\" is related. So if I use \"far,\" that's okay. Wait, the rules say I can't",
