	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "away," and I need to describe it without using "away," "gone," "distance," or "here." Hmm. Let me think about the meaning of "away." It usually means in the opposite direction from a place, or not present. Maybe I can use examples or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, maybe think of synonyms. Like "far," but "distance" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about "opposite of here"? Wait, "here" is a related word too. So I can't mention that. Maybe "not here." But that's using "here," which is forbidden. So that's out.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: when you say something is "away," like "the ball is away." Maybe use a scenario. Like "opposite of nearby." But "nearby" isn't a related word. Wait, but "distance" is related, so maybe avoid that. How about "opposite of close"? That might work. Let me check. If I say "opposite of close," does that point to "away"? Maybe. But the player might think of "far," but "far" is a related word? No, the related words are gone, distance, here. So "far" is allowed. Wait, but "distance" is related. So if I use "far," that's okay. Wait, the rules say I can't
