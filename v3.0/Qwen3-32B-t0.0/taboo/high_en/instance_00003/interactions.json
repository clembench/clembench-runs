Let me think about what finance means. It's related to managing money, but I can't use \"money.\" Maybe I can talk about the systems or processes involved. Like, handling funds, but \"fund\" is a related word. So I need to avoid that.\n\nFinance could be about budgeting, investments, or the management of assets. But how to phrase that without using the forbidden terms? Maybe \"the management of economic activities\" or something like that. Wait, \"economic\" might be okay. Let me check. The related words are resources, money, fund. So \"economic\" isn't one of them. \n\nAnother angle: finance is part of business operations. Maybe \"the area dealing with income and expenses in business.\" But \"income\" and \"expenses\" might be too close to money. Not sure if that's allowed. Let me think again. \n\nWhat about \"the practice of managing investments and savings\"? But \"savings\" could be related to money. Hmm. Maybe \"the system that involves loans, banking, and capital.\" But \"capital\" is similar to money. Wait, the user said not to use parts or morphological variants. So \"capital\" might be okay if it's not the same as the target word. \n\nAlternatively, \"the",
