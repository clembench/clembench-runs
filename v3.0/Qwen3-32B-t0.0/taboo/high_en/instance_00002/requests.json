The target word is \"band,\" and I need to describe it without using \"band,\" \"music,\" \"loop,\" or \"group.\" Hmm. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. A band can be a group of people, but \"group\" is a related word I can't use. Maybe think of a band in terms of something else, like a strip or a ring. Wait, a rubber band? No, that's a type of band, but maybe that's too specific. Or a police band? No, that's a group again. Wait, the related words are music, loop, group. So the other player might be thinking of a music band. I need to steer away from that. Maybe think of a band as a strip of material. Like a rubber band. So, something that holds things together, maybe. Or a strip around something. Let me try: \"A strip of material used to tie or hold things together.\" Does that work? Let me check if \"strip\" is allowed. The target word is \"band,\" and the related words are music, loop, group. So \"strip\" isn't a related word. But does that clue point to \"band\"? Maybe. Alternatively, think of a band as a ring, like a wedding band. But \"ring\" might not be directly helpful. Or a band on a drum? But that's part of music. Hmm. Maybe \"A",
