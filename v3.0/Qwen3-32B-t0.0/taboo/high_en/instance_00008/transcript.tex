	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt faq\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - list\\ \tt - question\\ \tt - answer\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "faq" and the related words are list, question, and answer. I need to describe "faq" without using those words or any of their variants. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does FAQ stand for? Frequently Asked Questions. But I can't use "question" or "list". So maybe I can hint at common queries or a compilation of them. But how to do that without using the forbidden words?\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe think of a website's section where people find common problems and solutions. But I can't say "problems" or "solutions" because they might be related. Wait, the related words are list, question, answer. So I need to avoid those. Let me think of synonyms or other ways to describe it.\\ \tt \\ \tt Perhaps "a collection of common queries and their responses". But "queries" is similar to "questions", which is a related word. So maybe "a compilation of often-asked topics and their explanations". But "topics" and "explanations" might be okay. Wait, but "explanations" is close to "answer". Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of it as a reference guide for typical issues. But again, "issues" might be too close. Maybe "a resource for commonly encountered problems and their solutions". But "solutions" is a form of answer. So that's not allowed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe use "a guide to common questions and their replies". But
