So maybe I can hint at common queries or a compilation of them. But how to do that without using the forbidden words?\n\nMaybe think of a website's section where people find common problems and solutions. But I can't say \"problems\" or \"solutions\" because they might be related. Wait, the related words are list, question, answer. So I need to avoid those. Let me think of synonyms or other ways to describe it.\n\nPerhaps \"a collection of common queries and their responses\". But \"queries\" is similar to \"questions\", which is a related word. So maybe \"a compilation of often-asked topics and their explanations\". But \"topics\" and \"explanations\" might be okay. Wait, but \"explanations\" is close to \"answer\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a reference guide for typical issues. But again, \"issues\" might be too close. Maybe \"a resource for commonly encountered problems and their solutions\". But \"solutions\" is a form of answer. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe use \"a guide to common questions and their replies\". But",
