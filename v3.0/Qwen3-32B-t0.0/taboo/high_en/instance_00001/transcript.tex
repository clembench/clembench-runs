	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "respect," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: consideration, deference, regard. Hmm. Let me think about the meaning of respect. It's about showing admiration or appreciation for someone or something. How can I convey that without using the forbidden words?\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe start with actions that show respect. Like treating someone with honor or valuing their opinions. But I have to avoid "consideration" and "regard." What about "treating someone as they deserve"? That might work. Or "showing admiration through actions." Wait, "admiration" is allowed? I don't think it's a related word. Let me check the related words again: consideration, deference, regard. So "admiration" is okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: respect is about not being disrespectful. But that's a bit negative. Maybe "acknowledging someone's worth." But "acknowledging" might be too vague. How about "valuing someone's opinions or beliefs without judgment"? That could be a clue. Or "the act of honoring someone's feelings or rights."\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "honoring" might be a good term. Let me try: "CLUE: Honoring someone's worth through actions or words." Does that use any forbidden words? No, "honoring" isn't a variant of respect, and the related words are consideration, deference, regard. So
