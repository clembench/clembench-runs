	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "stakeholder," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: partner, share, concerned. Hmm. Let me think about what a stakeholder is. A stakeholder is someone who has an interest in a company or project, right? They could be investors, employees, customers, maybe even the community. But I can't use "share" or "partner." So maybe I can say someone with a vested interest. Wait, "concerned" is a related word, so I can't use that either. How about "has a vested interest in the success of a company"? But I need to be concise. Maybe "person or group with a financial interest in a company's outcome." Wait, "financial" might be okay. Let me check the related words again. The related words are partner, share, concerned. So "financial interest" isn't directly related. But maybe "has a stake in the company's success." Oh, but "stake" is part of stakeholder. Oh, right, the target word is stakeholder, so I can't use "stake." Hmm. That's tricky. Maybe "someone who benefits or is affected by a company's decisions." But "affected" might be too close to "concerned." Alternatively, "individual or organization with a vested interest in a project's outcome." Vested interest might be a good
