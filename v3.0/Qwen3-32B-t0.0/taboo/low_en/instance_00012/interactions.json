Let me think about what a stakeholder is. A stakeholder is someone who has an interest in a company or project, right? They could be investors, employees, customers, maybe even the community. But I can't use \"share\" or \"partner.\" So maybe I can say someone with a vested interest. Wait, \"concerned\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. How about \"has a vested interest in the success of a company\"? But I need to be concise. Maybe \"person or group with a financial interest in a company's outcome.\" Wait, \"financial\" might be okay. Let me check the related words again. The related words are partner, share, concerned. So \"financial interest\" isn't directly related. But maybe \"has a stake in the company's success.\" Oh, but \"stake\" is part of stakeholder. Oh, right, the target word is stakeholder, so I can't use \"stake.\" Hmm. That's tricky. Maybe \"someone who benefits or is affected by a company's decisions.\" But \"affected\" might be too close to \"concerned.\" Alternatively, \"individual or organization with a vested interest in a project's outcome.\" Vested interest might be a good",
