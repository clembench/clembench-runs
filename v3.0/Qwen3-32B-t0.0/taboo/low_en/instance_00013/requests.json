The target word is \"wheat,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: grain, grass, flour. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what wheat is. It's a type of cereal crop, right? But \"cereal\" might be too broad. Maybe mention where it's used. Oh, it's used in making bread, but that might lead to flour, which is a related word. Wait, the related words include flour, so I can't mention that. How about the color? Wheat is golden when ripe. Maybe talk about the plant's structure—like stalks or ears. Or maybe the product, like bread or pasta, but again, avoiding flour. Maybe the process of harvesting? Or the fact that it's a staple food. Let me think of synonyms. Maybe \"a common crop grown in fields, used to make bread.\" Wait, \"crop\" is okay. \"Fields\" is okay. \"Make bread\" but that's related to flour. Hmm. Maybe \"a plant with stalks and golden heads, harvested for its seeds.\" Wait, \"seeds\" might be part of the related words? The related words are grain, grass, flour. \"Grain\" is a related word, so I can't use that. But \"seeds\" might be okay. Let me check. The target word is wheat, which is a type of grain.",
