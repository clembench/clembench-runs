The target word is \"boolean,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: logic, true, programming. Hmm. Boolean is a data type in programming that can be either true or false. But I can't mention programming or true. So maybe I should focus on the concept of two possible states. Like on/off, yes/no, or 1/0. Maybe say something like \"a system with two possible states\" or \"representing yes or no.\" Wait, but I need to make sure not to use any related words. Let me think again. Since it's related to logic, but I can't use \"logic.\" Maybe mention binary choices? Or a variable that can have only two values. Yeah, that could work. Let me try: \"A variable that can have only two possible values.\" That doesn't use the forbidden words. Let me check: no \"boolean,\" no \"logic,\" no \"true,\" no \"programming.\" Okay, that should be safe. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: A variable that can have only two possible values.<|im_end|>",
