	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "statue," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: sculpture, monument, or figure. Hmm. Let me think about the characteristics of a statue. It's a three-dimensional artwork, usually representing a person or thing. But I can't say sculpture. Maybe I can mention materials like marble or bronze. Also, statues are often placed in public spaces or museums. They're static, not moving. Maybe talk about being life-sized or larger. Oh, and they're created by artists. Let me try to form a clue that combines these elements without using the forbidden words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "monument" is a related word, so I can't use that either. So maybe focus on the fact that it's a representation of a person or animal, made from stone or metal. Also, they're often displayed in parks or plazas. Let me check if any of my clues might accidentally use a related word. For example, "sculpture" is a direct synonym, so I need to avoid that. Maybe mention that it's a carved or molded artwork. Yeah, that could work. Let me put that together concisely.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: A lifeless representation of a person or creature, often made from stone or metal and displayed publicly.
