	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "startup" and the related words are beginning, organization, and company. I need to describe "startup" without using those words or any of their parts or variants.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, think about what a startup is. It's a new business, right? But I can't use "company" or "organization." Maybe focus on the idea of launching something new. Words like "launch," "new venture," "innovative," "entrepreneurial." Also, startups often aim to grow quickly, so maybe mention growth or scaling. They might seek funding, so terms like "investment" or "funding" could work. But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Avoid using "beginning" as a related word. Maybe use "new" or "emerging." Let me try a clue: "A new venture aiming to grow rapidly, often seeking investment." Wait, does that use any forbidden words? "Venture" is okay, "investment" is allowed. Let me check related words again. No, that's safe. Maybe another angle: "A young business focused on innovation and scaling quickly." Hmm, "business" is similar to company, but maybe it's allowed. The rules say not to use parts or morphological variants. "Business" and "company" are related but not exact parts. Maybe that's okay. Let me go with the first clue. Let's make sure it's short and to
