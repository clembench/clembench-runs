	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "phantom," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: unreal, ghost, or apparition. Hmm. Let me think about the meaning of phantom. It's like something that appears but isn't real, right? Maybe something that's seen but doesn't exist. But I can't use "ghost" or "apparition." How else can I describe it?\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe talk about the effects. Like, a phantom could be a sensation or sound that isn't there. For example, phantom pain is when someone feels pain in a limb that's not there. But the related words include "unreal," so I can't use that. Wait, maybe I can say "unseen presence"? But "unseen" isn't a related word. Or "something that seems real but isn't." Wait, but "unreal" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of a phantom as a mirage or an illusion. But "mirage" might be a good clue. Or maybe "something that appears but vanishes." Or "a shadowy figure that isn't there." Wait, "shadowy figure" might be okay. Let me check the related words again. The related words are unreal, ghost, apparition. So "shadowy" isn't one of them. Maybe "a shadowy figure that isn't real
