Let me think about the meaning of competent. It means having the ability to do something well, right? So maybe I can focus on the idea of being able to handle tasks effectively.\n\nBut I can't use \"capable,\" which is a synonym. Maybe I can say something like \"able to handle tasks without issues.\" Wait, but \"able\" might be part of \"capable,\" which is a related word. Oh, right, \"capable\" is on the list, so I can't use \"able\" either? Or is \"able\" considered a part of it? The rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. \"Able\" is part of \"capable,\" so maybe that's not allowed. Hmm, tricky.\n\nWhat about \"having the necessary skills\"? But \"skills\" is part of \"skilled,\" which is a related word. So I can't use that. Maybe focus on the outcome. Like \"someone who can do the job well without mistakes.\" But \"do the job well\" might be too vague. Or \"someone who is trusted to perform tasks effectively.\" Wait, \"effectively\" is similar to \"efficient,\" which is a related word. So I can't use that either.\n\nHow about \"having the knowledge and",
