The target word is \"den,\" and the related words are cave, nest, and lair. So I can't use any of those words or their forms. Hmm, what's a den? It's a place where animals live, like a fox's den. But I can't say \"fox\" because maybe that's part of the related words? Wait, no, the related words are cave, nest, lair. So maybe it's okay. Wait, but I need to describe \"den\" without using those related words. So I need to think of another way.\n\nA den is a shelter or a hiding place. Maybe I can say \"underground shelter where some animals live.\" But wait, \"cave\" is a related word, so I can't use that. So maybe \"burrow\"? But is burrow a related word? No, it's not listed. But I need to make sure not to use any parts or morphological variants. Let me check. The related words are cave, nest, lair. So \"burrow\" is different. But maybe the player would think of burrow. But the target is den. So maybe the clue could be \"a shelter dug into the ground by certain animals.\" But does that use any forbidden words? Let's see. \"Shelter\" is okay. \"Dug into the ground\" is okay. \"Certain animals\" – maybe that's too vague",
