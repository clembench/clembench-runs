	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "sacrifice," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: loss, victim, offering. Hmm. Let me think about the meaning of sacrifice. It's when someone gives up something important, often for a greater cause or another person. So maybe focus on the idea of giving up something valuable.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I can't use "loss" or "offering." Maybe talk about giving up something personal for someone else's benefit. Or maybe use an example, like in religion, people might sacrifice by giving up certain things. Wait, but I need to be general. How about "giving up something important for a higher purpose"? Wait, "higher purpose" might be too vague. Let me think of synonyms. Maybe "giving up something you value to help others" or "giving up something personal for the good of others." Let me check if that avoids the related words. "Victim" is related, so I shouldn't mention someone being harmed. Maybe "giving up something you have to gain something for others." Or "giving up something you want to achieve a greater good." That might work. Let me make sure I don't use any forbidden words. "Sacrifice" is about giving up something, not necessarily a loss, but maybe the act of giving up. So the clue could be "Giving up something you value for the benefit of others or
