Let me think about the meaning of novelty. It's about something new, something that hasn't been seen before. Maybe I can use synonyms or related concepts that aren't on the forbidden list.\n\nSo, \"novelty\" refers to the quality of being new or different. How can I convey that? Maybe talk about introducing something for the first time. Like, \"the state of being introduced for the first time.\" But I need to make it concise. Let me check if \"introduced\" is allowed. The related words are oddity, originality, freshness. \"Introduced\" isn't one of them, so that's okay. \n\nAnother angle: something that's unexpected or surprising because it's new. But \"surprise\" might not directly point to novelty. Or maybe \"innovation,\" but innovation is related to originality, which is a related word. Wait, originality is on the list, so I can't use that. \n\nWhat about \"newness\"? But \"newness\" is a variant of \"new,\" which is part of \"novelty.\" Wait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. \"Novelty\" comes from \"novel,\" so \"new\" might be a part of",
