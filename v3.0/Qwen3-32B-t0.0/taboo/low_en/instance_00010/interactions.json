So maybe I can describe the process of identifying and solving issues without using the related words. Let me think. Maybe something like \"Figure out what's wrong and make it right.\" Wait, but \"fix\" is a related word, so I can't use \"make it right.\" Maybe \"resolve the issue\"? No, \"resolve\" might be okay. Or \"identify and solve a problem.\" Wait, \"solve\" is part of \"troubleshoot,\" but is \"solve\" a variant? The rules say not to use parts or morphological variants. \"Solve\" isn't a part of troubleshoot, but maybe it's too close. Let me check the related words again: fix, debug, diagnose. So \"solve\" might be okay. Let me try: \"Identify and solve a problem.\" But maybe that's too direct. Alternatively, think of a situation where troubleshooting is used, like with a computer or a machine. Maybe \"Check for issues in a system and correct them.\" But \"correct\" might be similar to fix. Hmm. Maybe \"Work through a problem step by step to find a solution.\" That",
