The target word is \"widow,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: woman, husband, dead. Hmm. Let me think about the definition. A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. But I can't use \"woman,\" \"husband,\" or \"dead.\" So I need another angle.\n\nMaybe focus on the legal or social status. Like, someone who is married but their partner is no longer alive. Wait, but again, that might involve the related words. How else can I phrase it? Maybe use a metaphor or a situation. For example, someone who wears a ring but their partner isn't around anymore? But \"partner\" could be too close to \"husband.\" \n\nAlternatively, think of a synonym that's not in the related words. Maybe \"a female who is married but her spouse is not present.\" But \"spouse\" is similar to \"husband.\" Maybe \"a person in a marriage where the other person has passed away.\" But \"passed away\" is a synonym for \"dead,\" which is a related word. So that's not allowed. \n\nWait, maybe use a different approach. Think of cultural symbols. Like a black dress or veil? But that's too vague. Or maybe a term from a specific context, like a tax status? Not sure. \n\nAnother angle: the opposite of \"bachelor.\" But \"bachelor\" is a",
