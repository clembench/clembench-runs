So, first, what's a hotdog? It's a type of food, right? It's a sausage in a bread roll, but I can't mention sausage or bread. Also, frankfurter is another name for a type of sausage, so I have to avoid that too.\n\nSo, how else can I describe it? Maybe focus on the shape or the way it's served. A hotdog is long and cylindrical, usually grilled or boiled. It's often eaten in a soft bun, but I can't say \"bun\" because that's similar to bread. Maybe talk about the condiments? Like ketchup, mustard, relish, or onions on top. But would that be enough for someone to guess it?\n\nAlternatively, think about the context where you see them. Like a street vendor, a baseball game, or a picnic. Maybe mention it's a popular street food. But how to connect that without using the forbidden words. Let me try a clue: \"A long, grilled meat served in a soft roll with toppings.\" Wait, \"meat\" is too vague. Maybe specify it's a type of processed meat? Or think of the shape. Maybe \"A cylindrical food item often topped with mustard and relish, sold by street",
