The target word is \"database,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: table, index, or knowledge. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what a database is. It's a collection of data, right? But \"data\" might be too vague. Maybe I can mention that it's organized. Oh, but \"table\" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about \"structured\"? A database is a structured collection of information. Wait, \"information\" is okay. Maybe \"organized\" is better. So, \"organized collection of information stored electronically.\" But I need to be concise. Let me think of another angle. Databases are used to store and retrieve data efficiently. Maybe mention that it's used in computers or systems. \"A system for storing and managing large amounts of data.\" That's good, but \"system\" might be too broad. What else? Maybe mention that it's used in applications like banking or websites. \"Centralized storage for data that can be accessed and managed by multiple users.\" Hmm, but \"centralized\" might not be necessary. Let me check the related words again. Table, index, knowledge. So I can't use \"table\" or \"index.\" Maybe \"organized\" is safe. \"A structured collection of data that allows efficient retrieval and management.\" That's better. Let me make sure I didn't use any forbidden",
