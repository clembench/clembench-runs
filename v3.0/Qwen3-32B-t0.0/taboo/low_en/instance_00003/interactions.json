I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants. \n\nFirst, think about the meaning of \"steady.\" It means not moving, stable, or consistent. But I can't use \"firm\" or \"constant.\" Maybe describe a situation where something is steady. Like a person standing still, or a line that doesn't waver. \n\nWait, \"even\" is related, so I can't use that either. How about using an example? Like a steady hand, but that might be too close. Maybe \"like a rock\" to imply stability. Or \"unwavering\" but that's a variant of \"steady.\" Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: in terms of movement, like not shaking. Or in a sentence, \"keeps moving without stopping.\" No, that's more like continuous. Maybe \"balanced\" but that's similar to firm. \n\nWhat about a metaphor? \"Like a mountain that doesn't move.\" But maybe too long. Need to be concise. How about \"unmoving and reliable\"? Wait, \"reliable\" isn't a related word. But does that help? The guesser might think of steady as reliable. \n\nAlternatively, think of contexts where \"steady\" is used. Like a steady diet, but that's about consistency. Maybe \"consistent over time\" but",
