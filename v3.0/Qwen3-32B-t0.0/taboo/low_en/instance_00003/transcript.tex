	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "steady," and the related words are constant, firm, and even. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, think about the meaning of "steady." It means not moving, stable, or consistent. But I can't use "firm" or "constant." Maybe describe a situation where something is steady. Like a person standing still, or a line that doesn't waver. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "even" is related, so I can't use that either. How about using an example? Like a steady hand, but that might be too close. Maybe "like a rock" to imply stability. Or "unwavering" but that's a variant of "steady." Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: in terms of movement, like not shaking. Or in a sentence, "keeps moving without stopping." No, that's more like continuous. Maybe "balanced" but that's similar to firm. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about a metaphor? "Like a mountain that doesn't move." But maybe too long. Need to be concise. How about "unmoving and reliable"? Wait, "reliable" isn't a related word. But does that help? The guesser might think of steady as reliable. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of contexts where "steady" is used. Like a steady diet, but that's about consistency. Maybe "consistent over time" but
