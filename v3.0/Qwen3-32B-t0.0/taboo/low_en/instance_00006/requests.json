I need to describe the word \"spoon\" without using the word itself or the related words: eating, dinner, bowl. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what a spoon is used for. It's used for eating, but \"eating\" is a related word I can't use. Maybe I can describe its shape. A spoon has a curved part and a handle. Maybe mention that it's used for stirring or scooping. Wait, stirring might be okay. Also, maybe it's used with soup? But \"dinner\" is related, but soup isn't listed. Wait, the related words are eating, dinner, bowl. So maybe I can say it's often used with soup. But need to check if that's allowed. Alternatively, think of materials—metal, plastic. But that's too vague. Maybe mention that it's one of the utensils, but not a fork or knife. Wait, but I can't use \"utensils\" because that's part of eating. Hmm. Let me try: \"A kitchen tool with a curved end for scooping and a handle, often used with hot liquids.\" Does that work? Let me check. No mention of spoon, eating, dinner, or bowl. Hot liquids could be soup, but maybe that's okay. Alternatively, \"Used to stir coffee or tea.\" But maybe that's too specific. Let me go with the first idea. Let me make",
