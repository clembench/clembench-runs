I need to describe \"notable\" without using any of those words or their variants. Hmm.\n\nFirst, think about synonyms for notable that aren't in the related list. Words like \"remarkable,\" \"conspicuous,\" \"distinguished,\" maybe \"well-known.\" But wait, \"important\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Let me avoid those.\n\nMaybe describe it in terms of being easily noticed or standing out. For example, \"easily noticed\" or \"stands out.\" But I need to be concise. Let me check if \"stands out\" is okay. The related words are important, outstanding, prominent. \"Outstanding\" is a related word, so I can't use that. So \"stands out\" might be too close. Maybe \"attracts attention\" or \"conspicuous.\"\n\nAnother angle: something that is memorable or significant. But \"significant\" is similar to important. Maybe \"worthy of attention\" or \"deserving notice.\" Let me make sure none of those words are in the related list. The related words are important, outstanding, prominent. So \"worthy of attention\" seems safe. \n\nAlternatively, think of examples. A notable event is one that's famous or well-known. Maybe \"well-known\" is a good substitute. But \"well-known\" isn't",
