	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "alabama," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: usa, state, river. Hmm. So the other player has to guess Alabama, but I can't mention USA, state, or river. Let me think about what I can say.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, Alabama is a U.S. state, but I can't say "state" or "USA." Maybe I can refer to it as a region or a place. Also, it's in the southeastern part of the country. Maybe mention the location. Also, there's the Alabama River, but I can't use "river," so maybe talk about a body of water without naming it. Or maybe think of other characteristics. The capital is Montgomery, but I don't know if that's helpful. There's also the University of Alabama, but that might be too specific. Maybe mention the nickname, like "Crimson Tide," but that's probably too obscure. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the game is collaborative, so the other player might know some key facts. Let me try to focus on the location. "Southeastern region known for its..." but what else? Maybe mention the climate, like warm weather, or the culture. Or maybe refer to the Civil Rights Movement, as Alabama was a significant place in that. But that might be too vague. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other words associated with Alabama without using the related terms.
