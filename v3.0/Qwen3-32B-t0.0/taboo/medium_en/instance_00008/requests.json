The target word is \"demo,\" and the related words are rally, show, and model. I need to describe \"demo\" without using those words or their variants. Hmm.\n\nFirst, what does \"demo\" mean? It can mean a demonstration, like a live example or a trial. But I can't use \"demonstration\" because that's a variant. Also, the related words are rally, show, model. So \"show\" is already a related word, so I can't use that. \"Model\" is another related word, so maybe like a sample or example? But I need to avoid that too.\n\nMaybe think of contexts where \"demo\" is used. Like a product demo, where a company shows how a product works. But I can't use \"show.\" Maybe \"trial version\" or \"preview.\" But how to phrase that without using related words.\n\nAnother angle: \"demo\" as short for demonstration. So, an event where something is demonstrated. But again, can't use \"demonstration.\" Maybe \"live example\" but \"example\" might be too vague. Or \"preview of a product's features.\" Wait, \"product\" is okay, but \"preview\" might be allowed. Let me check if \"preview\" is a related word. No, it's not listed. So maybe \"preview of how something works.\" But need to be concise.\n\nAlternatively, think of \"demo\" in",
