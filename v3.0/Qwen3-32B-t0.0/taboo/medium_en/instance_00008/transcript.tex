	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "demo," and the related words are rally, show, and model. I need to describe "demo" without using those words or their variants. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does "demo" mean? It can mean a demonstration, like a live example or a trial. But I can't use "demonstration" because that's a variant. Also, the related words are rally, show, model. So "show" is already a related word, so I can't use that. "Model" is another related word, so maybe like a sample or example? But I need to avoid that too.\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe think of contexts where "demo" is used. Like a product demo, where a company shows how a product works. But I can't use "show." Maybe "trial version" or "preview." But how to phrase that without using related words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "demo" as short for demonstration. So, an event where something is demonstrated. But again, can't use "demonstration." Maybe "live example" but "example" might be too vague. Or "preview of a product's features." Wait, "product" is okay, but "preview" might be allowed. Let me check if "preview" is a related word. No, it's not listed. So maybe "preview of how something works." But need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of "demo" in
