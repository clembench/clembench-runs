It's like a grid or a structure with rows and columns. But I can't say \"grid\" because maybe that's too similar to array or table. Wait, \"grid\" isn't a related word listed, so maybe that's okay. But I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, a matrix is used in math for linear algebra, or in movies like The Matrix, which is about a simulated reality. But the related words are array, table, model. So maybe I can hint at the mathematical structure. Like \"a rectangular arrangement of numbers\" but that might be too specific. Also, \"arrangement\" could be part of it. Wait, but the related word \"array\" is similar to arrangement. Maybe I should avoid that.\n\nAnother angle: In computing, a matrix is a data structure. But again, \"data structure\" is too vague. Maybe \"a two-dimensional structure with rows and columns.\" But \"rows and columns\" might be okay. Let me check the related words again. The related words are array, table, model. So if I say \"two-dimensional structure with rows and columns,\" that's not using any of the related words. But \"array\" is a related word, so I can't use that. But \"two",
