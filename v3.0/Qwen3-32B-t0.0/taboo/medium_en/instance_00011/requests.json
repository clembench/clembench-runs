The target word is \"murphy,\" and the related words are \"Irish,\" \"potato,\" and \"con.\" I need to describe \"murphy\" without using those words or any of their variants. Hmm.\n\nFirst, \"Murphy\" is a surname, right? So maybe I can mention that it's a last name. But I can't say \"Irish surname\" because \"Irish\" is a related word. So I need another way to describe it. Maybe \"common in Ireland\" but that might be too close to \"Irish.\" Wait, the related words are \"Irish,\" \"potato,\" and \"con,\" so I need to avoid those. \n\nAlso, \"Murphy\" is a character in \"The Irishman,\" but that's probably too specific. Maybe think of Murphy's Law? \"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\" That's a phrase associated with Murphy. But does that help the other player guess? Maybe. Let me check if \"Murphy's Law\" is a common enough reference. If the other player knows that, then it could work. But I can't use the word \"law\" directly? Wait, the rules say I can't use the target word or related words. \"Law\" isn't a related word here, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, \"Murphy\" is a type of name, maybe a surname. So I can say",
