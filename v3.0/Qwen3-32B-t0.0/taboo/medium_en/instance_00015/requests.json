The target word is \"toilet,\" and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: flush, restroom, or urinate. Hmm. Let me think about the key features of a toilet. It's a fixture used for... well, you know. But I can't say urinate. Maybe I can describe its function indirectly. Like, \"used for eliminating waste.\" But wait, maybe that's too vague. Or maybe \"found in a bathroom, used for...\" but restroom is a related word, so I can't mention that. How about \"where you sit to relieve yourself\"? But again, need to avoid related terms. Maybe focus on parts? Like \"has a seat and a bowl.\" But then, how does that connect? Alternatively, think about actions associated with it. \"You sit here after meals sometimes.\" Not sure. Or \"needs to be cleaned regularly.\" Maybe. Or \"connected to plumbing.\" Hmm. Let me check the related words again. Flush is related, so I can't use that. Restroom is the room, but I can't mention that. Maybe \"a fixture in a home for personal hygiene.\" Still, maybe too close. Wait, maybe \"used to dispose of bodily waste.\" That might work. Let me make sure none of the related words are in there. Yeah, \"dispose\" is okay. So the clue could be: \"A fixture used to dispose of",
