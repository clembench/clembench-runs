	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "sword," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: blade, weapon, sharp. Hmm. Let's start by thinking about what a sword is. It's a type of weapon, but I can't say weapon. It has a blade, but I can't mention blade. It's sharp, but that's also off-limits.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, maybe think about its use. A sword is used for fighting or self-defense. But how to describe that without using the related words? Maybe talk about its components. A sword has a handle, a hilt, maybe a guard. But the other player might not know those terms. Alternatively, think about historical context—used in battles, by knights or samurais. Or maybe the shape: long, straight, with a pointed end. But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user wants short, to-the-point clues. Let me brainstorm some possible clues. "Used in duels for combat." But "combat" might be too vague. "Metal object with a hilt and a pointed end." That could work. But does that use any forbidden terms? Metal is okay, hilt is okay, pointed end—yes. But maybe the player could guess "dagger" or something else. Maybe add something about being a tool for fighting. "Tool for close combat with a straight edge." Wait, "edge" might
