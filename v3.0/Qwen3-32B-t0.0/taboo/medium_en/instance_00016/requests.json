The target word is \"emphasize,\" and the related words are highlight, underscore, and stress. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants. \n\nFirst, what does \"emphasize\" mean? It means to give special importance or attention to something. So I need to describe that action without using the forbidden words. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe something like \"make more noticeable\" or \"draw attention to.\" But I have to avoid the related words. \n\nWait, \"highlight\" is already a related word, so I can't say \"make prominent.\" Hmm. How about \"stress the importance of\"? No, \"stress\" is a related word. Oh right, so that's out. Maybe \"focus on strongly\"? Or \"give more weight to\"? \n\nAnother angle: when you emphasize something, you might do it by speaking louder, using bold text, or repeating. Maybe \"make more prominent through repetition or tone\"? But that's a bit long. The user wants short and to the point. \n\nWhat about \"accentuate\"? But that's similar to emphasize. Maybe \"accentuate a point without using forbidden terms.\" Wait, the clue has to be in English and not use the target or related words. \n\nHow about \"CLUE: Make a point stand out more.\" Does that work? Let me check. \"Make stand out\" is",
