	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "emphasize," and the related words are highlight, underscore, and stress. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does "emphasize" mean? It means to give special importance or attention to something. So I need to describe that action without using the forbidden words. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe something like "make more noticeable" or "draw attention to." But I have to avoid the related words. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "highlight" is already a related word, so I can't say "make prominent." Hmm. How about "stress the importance of"? No, "stress" is a related word. Oh right, so that's out. Maybe "focus on strongly"? Or "give more weight to"? \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: when you emphasize something, you might do it by speaking louder, using bold text, or repeating. Maybe "make more prominent through repetition or tone"? But that's a bit long. The user wants short and to the point. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about "accentuate"? But that's similar to emphasize. Maybe "accentuate a point without using forbidden terms." Wait, the clue has to be in English and not use the target or related words. \\ \tt \\ \tt How about "CLUE: Make a point stand out more." Does that work? Let me check. "Make stand out" is
