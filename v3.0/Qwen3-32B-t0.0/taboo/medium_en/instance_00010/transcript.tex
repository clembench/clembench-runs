	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "surprise," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: party, shock, or unexpected. Hmm. Let me think of synonyms or related concepts that aren't on the list.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "surprise" can mean something unexpected. But "unexpected" is a related word I can't use. Maybe I can describe the feeling it gives. Like a sudden reaction. Maybe "a sudden reaction to something unforeseen"? Wait, "unforeseen" might be too similar to unexpected. Maybe "a sudden reaction to something you didn't see coming." But I need to be concise.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of examples. Like a surprise could be a gift or an event, but "party" is a related word. So I can't mention that. Maybe "a pleasant or unpleasant occurrence that happens without warning." But "occurrence" might be too vague. Or "an event that catches you off guard." That might work. Let me check if "off guard" is allowed. The related words are party, shock, unexpected. "Off guard" isn't any of those. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: the verb form. To surprise someone. So maybe "to catch someone unawares." But "unawares" is similar to unexpected. Maybe "to catch someone by surprise." Wait, but I can't use "surprise." Hmm. Maybe "to startle someone without prior
