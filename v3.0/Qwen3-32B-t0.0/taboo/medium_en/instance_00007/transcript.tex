	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt queue\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - line\\ \tt - row\\ \tt - chain\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "queue," and the related words are line, row, and chain. I need to describe "queue" without using those words or any of their forms. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, what does a queue mean? It's a line of people or things waiting their turn. But I can't say "line" because that's a related word. So maybe I can use synonyms or describe the action. Like waiting in order, or a sequence. Maybe mention that people are waiting one after another. Or use a metaphor, like a snake moving forward. Wait, "snake" might not be helpful. How about "waiting in order"? But "order" is part of the word "queue." Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: think of a queue in a computer context, like a data structure where the first in is first out. But maybe that's too technical. The other player might not know that. Let's stick to common usage. People waiting at a ticket counter, for example. But how to describe that without using "line." Maybe "a group waiting one by one." Or "a sequence where each follows the previous." \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "sequence" is allowed? The related words are line, row, chain. "Sequence" isn't one of them. So maybe "a sequence of people waiting." But "waiting" is okay. Let me check the rules again. I can't use the target word or related words.
