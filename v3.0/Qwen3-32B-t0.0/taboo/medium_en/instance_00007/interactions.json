I need to describe \"queue\" without using those words or any of their forms. Hmm.\n\nFirst, what does a queue mean? It's a line of people or things waiting their turn. But I can't say \"line\" because that's a related word. So maybe I can use synonyms or describe the action. Like waiting in order, or a sequence. Maybe mention that people are waiting one after another. Or use a metaphor, like a snake moving forward. Wait, \"snake\" might not be helpful. How about \"waiting in order\"? But \"order\" is part of the word \"queue.\" Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: think of a queue in a computer context, like a data structure where the first in is first out. But maybe that's too technical. The other player might not know that. Let's stick to common usage. People waiting at a ticket counter, for example. But how to describe that without using \"line.\" Maybe \"a group waiting one by one.\" Or \"a sequence where each follows the previous.\" \n\nWait, \"sequence\" is allowed? The related words are line, row, chain. \"Sequence\" isn't one of them. So maybe \"a sequence of people waiting.\" But \"waiting\" is okay. Let me check the rules again. I can't use the target word or related words.",
