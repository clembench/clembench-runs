Let me think about the definition of prospective. It usually refers to something expected to happen in the future, like prospective students or a prospective plan. But I can't mention future. Maybe I can focus on the idea of possibility or likelihood. Wait, \"potential\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. \n\nWhat about synonyms? Maybe \"possible\" or \"anticipated\"? But I need to avoid any related words. Let me think of a scenario. If someone is looking to join a program, they might be called a prospective member. So maybe I can say \"possible candidate for a position.\" But I need to make sure not to use any forbidden terms. Let me check: \"possible\" isn't a related word. Okay. Another angle: \"prospective\" can mean looking forward to something. But \"foresight\" is related, so I can't use that. Maybe \"looking ahead\" but that's similar to foresight. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key is that \"prospective\" often refers to something that is possible but not yet certain. So maybe \"possible but not yet confirmed.\" Let me test that. If I say \"possible but not yet confirmed,\" does that lead to \"prospective\"? Maybe. Let",
