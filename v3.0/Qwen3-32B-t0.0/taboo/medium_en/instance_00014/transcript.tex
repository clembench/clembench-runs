	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "sweep," and I need to describe it without using "sweep," "clean," "cover," or "brush." Hmm. Let me think about the actions or results associated with sweeping. When you sweep, you move a broom across the floor to gather dirt. But I can't mention "broom" or "clean." Maybe focus on the motion. Like a wide, sweeping motion. Wait, but "sweeping" is part of the target word. Oh, right, I can't use any morphological variants either. So "sweeping" is out.\\ \tt \\ \tt What's another angle? The result of sweeping is a clean floor, but I can't use "clean." Maybe "remove debris"? But how to describe the action. Maybe "move back and forth to gather." But "gather" might be too vague. Or "push dirt into a pile." But again, need to be concise. The user wants a short clue. Let me think of synonyms. "Brush" is a related word, so I can't use that. "Cover" is another related word. Maybe "wide motion to clear." Wait, "clear" is similar to clean. Hmm. Maybe "action of moving a tool to collect dirt." But "tool" could be a broom, which is related to brush. Oh, but "brush" is a related word. So I can't mention that.
