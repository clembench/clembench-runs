The target word is \"sweep,\" and I need to describe it without using \"sweep,\" \"clean,\" \"cover,\" or \"brush.\" Hmm. Let me think about the actions or results associated with sweeping. When you sweep, you move a broom across the floor to gather dirt. But I can't mention \"broom\" or \"clean.\" Maybe focus on the motion. Like a wide, sweeping motion. Wait, but \"sweeping\" is part of the target word. Oh, right, I can't use any morphological variants either. So \"sweeping\" is out.\n\nWhat's another angle? The result of sweeping is a clean floor, but I can't use \"clean.\" Maybe \"remove debris\"? But how to describe the action. Maybe \"move back and forth to gather.\" But \"gather\" might be too vague. Or \"push dirt into a pile.\" But again, need to be concise. The user wants a short clue. Let me think of synonyms. \"Brush\" is a related word, so I can't use that. \"Cover\" is another related word. Maybe \"wide motion to clear.\" Wait, \"clear\" is similar to clean. Hmm. Maybe \"action of moving a tool to collect dirt.\" But \"tool\" could be a broom, which is related to brush. Oh, but \"brush\" is a related word. So I can't mention that.",
