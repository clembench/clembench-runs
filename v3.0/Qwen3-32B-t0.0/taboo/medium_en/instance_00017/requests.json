The target word is \"nick,\" and I need to describe it without using \"nick\" or the related words: groove, dent, cut. Hmm. What does \"nick\" mean? A small cut or scratch, right? But I can't use \"cut.\" Maybe I can describe it as a tiny mark on a surface. Or maybe mention that it's a minor injury to an object. Wait, \"dent\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. How about saying it's a small indentation? No, \"dent\" is related. Maybe \"a little scrape\"? But \"scrape\" might be too similar to \"cut.\" Alternatively, think of synonyms like \"scratch,\" but again, need to avoid related terms. Maybe describe the action: \"To make a small mark by scraping.\" But I need to be concise. Let me check if \"scratch\" is allowed. The related words are groove, dent, cut. \"Scratch\" isn't listed, so maybe that's okay. So the clue could be \"A small scratch on a surface.\" Wait, but \"scratch\" might be a better approach. Let me make sure I'm not using any forbidden words. Yes, \"scratch\" isn't a related word. So CLUE: A tiny scratch or mark made by scraping. That should work. Let me double-check. No mention of nick, groove, dent, or cut. Okay, that",
