I need to describe \"bill\" without using those words or any of their forms. Hmm.\n\nFirst, think about what a bill is. It's a document you get when you buy something, right? But I can't say \"invoice\" because that's a related word. So maybe talk about the purpose. Like, when you eat at a restaurant, they give you this to pay. But \"pay\" is a related word. Oh, right, can't use that either.\n\nMaybe describe the action. Like, after a meal, you ask for this to settle the amount owed. But \"settle\" might be okay. Wait, \"amount owed\" could be close to \"charge,\" but maybe not. Let me check. The related words are pay, charge, invoice. So \"charge\" is off-limits. So maybe \"amount owed\" is okay as long as I don't use \"charge.\"\n\nAnother angle: a bill is a legal document from a service provider. But again, \"service\" might be too vague. Or think of a bird's bill, but that's a different meaning. Wait, the target word is \"bill\" as in the financial document. So stick to that.\n\nHow about: \"A document showing the total cost of goods or services.\" But \"cost\" is okay. Wait, \"total cost",
