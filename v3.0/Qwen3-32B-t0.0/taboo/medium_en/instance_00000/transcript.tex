	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "declaration," and I need to describe it without using the word itself or the related words: law, resolution, testimony. Hmm. Let me think about what a declaration is. It's a formal statement or announcement. So maybe I can mention something about making an official statement. But I have to avoid related terms. Let me check the related words again. Law, resolution, testimony. So I can't say anything about legal terms or decisions. Maybe focus on the act of stating something publicly. Like announcing something officially. Or perhaps a written statement. Wait, "written statement" might be too vague. How about "formal announcement"? That seems safe. Let me make sure none of the related words are in there. Law is about legal stuff, resolution could be a decision, and testimony is a statement given under oath. So "formal announcement" should be okay. Let me go with that. CLUE: Formal announcement made by an authority or individual. That should work. Let me check again. No mention of the target word or related words. Yeah, that's good.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt CLUE: Formal announcement made by an authority or individual.
