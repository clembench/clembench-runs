	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target word is "violation," and the related words are transgression, misdemeanor, and offence. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their variants.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about the definition of violation. It generally means a failure to comply with a law, rule, or obligation. So maybe I can describe it as breaking a rule or law. But I have to avoid the related words. Transgression is similar, so I can't use that. Maybe something like "breaking a rule or regulation." Wait, "regulation" isn't a related word, right? Let me check. The related words are transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So "regulation" is safe. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: a violation could be an act that's against established norms. Maybe "an act against established rules." But "against" might be too vague. How about "breaching a law or standard"? "Breach" might be a good term here. Let me make sure "breach" isn't a related word. No, the related words are the ones listed. So "breach of a law or standard" could work. But the clue needs to be concise. Maybe "CLUE: Breach of a law or standard." That seems to fit. Let me double-check that none of the forbidden words are there. No violation, transgression, misdemeanor, or offence. Looks good
