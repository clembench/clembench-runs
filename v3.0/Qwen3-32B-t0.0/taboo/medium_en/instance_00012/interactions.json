Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"demographic\" means. It relates to the characteristics of a population, like age, gender, income, etc. But I can't mention \"people\" or \"group.\" Maybe focus on data or categories. Oh, but \"statistic\" is also a related word, so I can't use that either.\n\nHow about \"data about population characteristics\"? Wait, \"population\" might be okay. But maybe too close to \"people.\" Let me think. Maybe \"categories used in market research\"? That could work. Or \"segments based on age, income, etc.\" But I need to be concise.\n\nAnother angle: \"related to the study of population structure.\" But again, \"population\" might be tricky. Maybe \"types of data for analyzing markets.\" Wait, \"market\" isn't restricted. But is that too specific? Demographic isn't just for markets. Maybe \"classification based on factors like age and income.\" That avoids the related words. Let me check: no \"people,\" \"group,\" \"statistic.\" Yeah, that's better. So the clue could be \"classification based on age, income, and other factors.\" That should hint at demographic without violating the rules.\n</think>\n\nCLUE: Classification based on age, income",
