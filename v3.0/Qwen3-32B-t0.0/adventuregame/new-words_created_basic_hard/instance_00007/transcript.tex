	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can onser, mellum, clogery, ellous, ially and upbes.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the hetle anird, the ioness opige and the rotont reforian.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a atival now. There are a equadish, a fervan, a ioness, a rotont, a thium and a herper. There is a passage to a routiced here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the hetle anird, the ioness opige, and the rotont reforian. The user is in an atival with several items: equadish, fervan, ioness, rotont, thium, herper, and a passage to a routiced.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should figure out what actions correspond to the required changes. The verbs available are onser, mellum, clogery, ellous, ially, upbes, along with common actions. The goal is to transform three specific items. \\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the items present, the ioness and rotont are part of the goal. The hetle anird isn't in the current room, so maybe I need to go to the routiced passage to find it. But first, maybe I should interact with the ioness here. The required state for ioness is opige. Let's think about possible actions. Mellum might mean to melt or change state, but not sure. Onser could be to pour or transfer. Clogery might be to block or open. Ellous could be to illuminate. Ially and upbes are unclear. \\ \tt \\ \tt Since the ioness is here, maybe using an action on it to make it opige. Let's try "mellum ioness" to see if that changes its state. Alternatively, maybe "onser" something into it. But there's a fervan
