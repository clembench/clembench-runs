I need to make the pholoiced connone, the aeval proggiced, and the rheably exsem. Hmm. First, I should figure out what these terms mean. Maybe they're items or actions in the game. The current location is a peroury, and there are several objects here: shromen, oidess, eical, versch, pholoiced, and aeval. There's also a passage to an erove.\n\nThe goal mentions making the pholoiced connone. Since there's already a pholoiced here, maybe I need to combine it with something else to make it connone. Similarly, the aeval proggiced—there's an aeval present, so perhaps I need to do something to it. The rheably exsem is the third part; not sure what that is yet.\n\nPossible actions include common ones like open, take, use, but also some unique verbs: udial, aterous, ingnus, ivess, ceorid, unmastic. Maybe these verbs are key to achieving the goal. Let me think. For example, if I need to make the pholoiced connone, maybe using one of these verbs on it. Let's check the objects:\n\n- pholoiced is here. Maybe I need to use a verb on it. Let's try \"udial pholoiced\" or something. But I don't know what",
