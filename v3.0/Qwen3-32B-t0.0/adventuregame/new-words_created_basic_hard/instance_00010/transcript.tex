	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can udial, aterous, ingnus, ivess, ceorid and unmastic.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the pholoiced connone, the aeval proggiced and the rheably exsem.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a peroury now. There are a shromen, a oidess, a eical, a versch, a pholoiced and a aeval. There is a passage to a erove here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the pholoiced connone, the aeval proggiced, and the rheably exsem. Hmm. First, I should figure out what these terms mean. Maybe they're items or actions in the game. The current location is a peroury, and there are several objects here: shromen, oidess, eical, versch, pholoiced, and aeval. There's also a passage to an erove.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal mentions making the pholoiced connone. Since there's already a pholoiced here, maybe I need to combine it with something else to make it connone. Similarly, the aeval proggicedâ€”there's an aeval present, so perhaps I need to do something to it. The rheably exsem is the third part; not sure what that is yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Possible actions include common ones like open, take, use, but also some unique verbs: udial, aterous, ingnus, ivess, ceorid, unmastic. Maybe these verbs are key to achieving the goal. Let me think. For example, if I need to make the pholoiced connone, maybe using one of these verbs on it. Let's check the objects:\\ \tt \\ \tt - pholoiced is here. Maybe I need to use a verb on it. Let's try "udial pholoiced" or something. But I don't know what
