I need to make the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust, and the loscred tibing. First, I should figure out what each of these items is and how to create them. The player is in a discroust with several objects: a loscred, a suncente, a urermat, a conitity, a hidist, and an eposper. There's also a passage to a gligiced.\n\nLooking at the items, the urermat is already present. The goal mentions making the urermat ytoust. Maybe \"ytoust\" is a state or a modification of the urermat. So perhaps I need to interact with the urermat here. The other items required are rimess horpler and loscred tibing. The loscred is present, so maybe \"tibing\" is something I can do with it. But first, I need to check each item.\n\nSince the urermat is here, maybe I should try the \"ytoust\" action on it. The available actions include \"eredle\", \"unsibion\", \"phophous\", \"isecin\", \"horehet\", and \"indiable\". Wait, but the user mentioned that in addition to common actions, those are available. But the example given was \"open cupboard\", so maybe those are verbs that can be applied to objects. For example, maybe \"yt",
