	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a prolly, a arger, a shness, a proark, a hypner and a rabish. There is a passage to a comper here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to make the prolly lingly, the proark incry, and the acion arliced. First, I need to understand what these terms mean, but since they're probably made-up words from the game's context, I'll have to go by the possible actions provided.\\ \tt \\ \tt The available actions are seash, andect, lotis, belity, irear, deint, along with common actions like open, close, etc. The current location is a distral with several objects: prolly, arger, shness, proark, hypner, rabish. There's also a passage to a comper.\\ \tt \\ \tt My first thought is to interact with the prolly since the goal mentions making it lingly. Maybe using one of the special actions on it. Let me consider each possible action:\\ \tt \\ \tt - seash: Maybe related to the sea? Not sure.\\ \tt - andect: Could be "and act"? Maybe perform an action.\\ \tt - lotis: Maybe "lotus"? A flower? Could be a command to use an item.\\ \tt - belity: Possibly "beility"? Not sure.\\ \tt - irear: Maybe "ear" related? Or "ire" (anger) + ear?\\ \tt - deint: Maybe "de-int" or "daint"?\\ \tt \\ \tt Since "lingly" might mean to make it active or do something, perhaps using "
