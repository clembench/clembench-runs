The items here are a strood, a perent, a inchan, a aciong, a eucty, and a oming. There's also a passage to a stful. The available actions besides common ones are iscad, eriat, ovesis, mingne, setral, and lepht.\n\nFirst, the goal mentions the strood needs to be aphistic. Maybe I need to interact with the strood using one of these special actions. Let's look at the items. The strood is present here. The aciong is also here, which needs to become dolam. The swaiced ailly partâ€”swaiced isn't listed here, but maybe it's in the stful? The passage leads to stful, so maybe I need to go there for that part.\n\nBut first, let's tackle the strood.
