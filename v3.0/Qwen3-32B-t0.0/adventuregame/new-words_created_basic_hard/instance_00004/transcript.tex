	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a strood, a perent, a inchan, a aciong, a eucty and a oming. There is a passage to a stful here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to make the strood aphistic, the aciong dolam, and the swaiced ailly. First, I need to understand what these terms mean, but since they're probably made-up words from the game's context, I'll have to go by the actions available and the items present.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current location is an encal. The items here are a strood, a perent, a inchan, a aciong, a eucty, and a oming. There's also a passage to a stful. The available actions besides common ones are iscad, eriat, ovesis, mingne, setral, and lepht.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the goal mentions the strood needs to be aphistic. Maybe I need to interact with the strood using one of these special actions. Let's look at the items. The strood is present here. The aciong is also here, which needs to become dolam. The swaiced ailly partâ€”swaiced isn't listed here, but maybe it's in the stful? The passage leads to stful, so maybe I need to go there for that part.\\ \tt \\ \tt But first, let's tackle the strood. The action needed to make it aphistic. Let's think of possible actions. The available actions are iscad, eriat, o
