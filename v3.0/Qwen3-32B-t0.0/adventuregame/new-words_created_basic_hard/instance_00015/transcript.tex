	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can prophedly, lystly, curatily, uncomagol, tationnis and sifoat.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the telyphy vatmene, the rogisart pineger and the pienthor exabarb.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a caligaticed now. There are a ubdonee, a tecural, a pakably, a aribess, a pienthor and a rogisart. There is a passage to a gurlite here.

There are several objects here: ubdonee, tecural, pakably, aribess, pienthor, and rogisart. There's also a passage to a gurlite. My goal involves the pienthor exabarb, so maybe I need to interact with the pienthor first. The rogisart is here, so maybe I need to do something with it to make the rogisart pineger. And the telyphy vatmene... perhaps that's related to the tecural or another object?\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the user mentioned possible actions like prophedly, lystly, curatily, uncomagol, tationnis, and sifoat, I should consider those. Let me start by interacting with the pienthor. Maybe I need to use one of the actions on it. Let's try curatily pienthor. That might be a way to "cure" or change its state to exabarb. Alternatively, maybe sifoat or tationnis. But
