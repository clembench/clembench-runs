The current location is a catint with several objects: unflued, sioust, menny, ortid, pacia, rist. There's also a passage to a penol.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the objects here. The menny is mentioned, so maybe I need to interact with it to make it soriced. The ortid is here too, so maybe that's next. But the goal mentions tulacy enerk, which might be in another room. The passage to penol might be important. But what do the actions latory, tedne, derman, tuate, chross, and sulphy do? These are custom actions, so I need to guess their purposes. \n\nSince the goal is to make things enerk, soriced, and alism, maybe those actions modify the objects. For example, \"tuate\" might be related to enerk. Let me check the words. Tulacy enerk â€“ maybe \"tuate\" the tulacy? But tulacy isn't here yet. Maybe I need to go to the penol first. But the current room has menny and ortid. The menny needs to be soriced. Maybe \"sulphy\" or \"chross\" affects",
