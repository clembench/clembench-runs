	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia and crury.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the eprour reging, the siaticed degra and the piesm ricke.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a lon now. There are a teming, a orele, a eprour, a riack, a siaticed and a astont. There is a passage to a lablent here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the eprour reging, the siaticed degra, and the piesm ricke. First, I should figure out what each of these terms means. Since they're not standard words, maybe they're objects or characters in the game. The eprour is mentioned here in the room, so maybe I need to interact with it. The siaticed is also present, and there's a passage to a lablent. The goal is to make these three things happen or be transformed.\\ \tt \\ \tt The available actions include erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia, and crury. These are probably specific commands in the game. Let me think about possible combinations. Since the eprour is here, maybe I need to perform an action on it. Let's try "erack eprour" to see if that starts the process. Alternatively, maybe "icalit" is a relevant action. But without more context, I'll have to guess. Let's start with the eprour and try one of the actions. Maybe "erack eprour" to make it reging. If that doesn't work, I can try other actions on the other objects.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > erack eprour
