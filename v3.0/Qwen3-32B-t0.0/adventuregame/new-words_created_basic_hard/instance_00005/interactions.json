Since they're not standard words, maybe they're objects or characters in the game. The eprour is mentioned here in the room, so maybe I need to interact with it. The siaticed is also present, and there's a passage to a lablent. The goal is to make these three things happen or be transformed.\n\nThe available actions include erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia, and crury. These are probably specific commands in the game. Let me think about possible combinations. Since the eprour is here, maybe I need to perform an action on it. Let's try \"erack eprour\" to see if that starts the process. Alternatively, maybe \"icalit\" is a relevant action. But without more context, I'll have to guess. Let's start with the eprour and try one of the actions. Maybe \"erack eprour\" to make it reging. If that doesn't work, I can try other actions on the other objects.\n</think>\n\n> erack eprour",
