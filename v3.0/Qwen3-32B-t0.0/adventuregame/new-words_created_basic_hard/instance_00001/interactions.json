The first part of the goal is to make the secti unpish. Maybe I need to interact with the secti. Let's think about possible actions. The word \"unpish\" might be a verb. So maybe \"unpish secti\" is an action? But the allowed actions are the ones listed. Wait, the user said I can use delly, heted, ousne, unalin, thoty, ceous. So perhaps these are the verbs. Let me check if any of these correspond to the goal.\n\nThe goal mentions \"make the secti unpish\". If \"unpish\" is part of the action, maybe the correct verb is one of the allowed ones. Let me think. Maybe \"unpish\" is achieved by using \"ceous\" on the secti? Or maybe \"unalin\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the action",
