	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can amyoid, jolene, tritioush, oryter, atheris and urseum.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the utist hetioner, the icess tubilly and the anonaticed ippet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a endroust now. There are a utist, a stoaced, a icess, a coepticed, a lableve and a atedist. There is a passage to a oidemat here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the utist hetioner, the icess tubilly, and the anonaticed ippet. Hmm, first, I should figure out what each of these items is and how to transform them. The utist is here in the endroust. Maybe I need to do something with the utist first. The available actions include some unique verbs like amyoid, jolene, tritioush, oryter, atheris, and urseum. Let me think... The goal mentions making the utist hetioner. So maybe I need to apply one of these actions to the utist. Let me check the possible actions again. If "hetioner" is a form or result of an action, perhaps "amyoid" could be the verb here? Or maybe "jolene"? Not sure. Let me try the most logical one first. Maybe "amyoid" the utist? Let me try that. If that doesn't work, I can try others. So the action would be > amyoid utist. Let's see what happens.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > amyoid utist
