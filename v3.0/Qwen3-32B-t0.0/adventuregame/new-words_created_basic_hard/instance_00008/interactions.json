The available actions include some unusual ones like abluty, uningne, athemb, altric, polotit, and arimic. \n\nFirst, I'm in a hydroft with several objects: hooiced, alloger, chophal, eleniced, glogly, gicalio, and a passage to an itink. The first part of the goal is to make the chophal permity. Maybe I need to interact with the chophal directly. Let me check the possible actions. The word \"permity\" might be a play on \"permit\" or \"permeate,\" but since the action is \"altric,\" maybe that's relevant. Wait, \"altric\" could be related to altering something. So perhaps using altric on the chophal to make it permity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"permity\" is a typo for \"permeate\" or \"permit,\" but given the game's vocabulary, I should stick to the given actions. Let me try using altric on the chophal first. That might change its state to permity. Then, the next step would be to deal with the hooiced nionian.",
