	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic and proar.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the inat mateny, the diale unsust and the subst dented.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a cally now. There are a mical, a pante, a subst, a eness, a sness and a inat. There is a passage to a unree here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to achieve three goals: make the inat mateny, the diale unsust, and the subst dented. The current location is a cally with several objects: mical, pante, subst, eness, sness, and inat. There's also a passage to a unree.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out what actions to take. The allowed actions include common ones plus some unique ones like mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic, proar. The goal is to modify the inat to be mateny, diale to be unsust, and subst to be dented.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the objects present, the inat is here. To make it mateny, maybe use the mator action? Since "mator" could be a verb related to making something mateny. So maybe > mator inat.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user's goal is to make the inat mateny. If "mator" is an action, perhaps applying it to the inat would achieve that. Let me check if that's the correct action. Since the example actions include mator, maybe that's the right move. Let's try that first. Then check if that's one step done. Next, need to make diale unsust. But where is the diale? The current location has a passage to unree
