	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can propress, atifory, alful, adcry, spidene and pnestay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the oubiced ecastic, the prachon dedulag and the mindly ropile.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a sinark now. There are a prachon, a uncepist, a epteria, a ionity, a clednee and a mindly. There is a passage to a conader here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to make the oubiced ecastic, the prachon dedulag, and the mindly ropile. Hmm. First, I should figure out what each of these terms means. Since they're not real words, maybe they're specific to the game. Let me break them down.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting with the prachon dedulag. There's a prachon in the current room. Maybe I need to do something to the prachon to make it dedulag. Dedulag might be a state or a transformation. Common actions include open, close, etc., but there are also special actions like propress, atifory, alful, adcry, spidene, pnestay. Maybe one of these actions applies here.\\ \tt \\ \tt The mindly needs to be ropile. There's a mindly present. Ropile could be a verb. Maybe "ropile" is an action? But the allowed actions don't include that. Wait, the user mentioned that in addition to common actions, those special ones are allowed. So perhaps I need to use one of those. For example, maybe "alful" or "adcry" the mindly to make it ropile.\\ \tt \\ \tt The oubiced ecastic. There's a uncepist here. Maybe "oubiced" is related to the uncepist? Maybe I need to make the uncepist ecastic.
