I need to make the oubiced ecastic, the prachon dedulag, and the mindly ropile. Hmm. First, I should figure out what each of these terms means. Since they're not real words, maybe they're specific to the game. Let me break them down.\n\nStarting with the prachon dedulag. There's a prachon in the current room. Maybe I need to do something to the prachon to make it dedulag. Dedulag might be a state or a transformation. Common actions include open, close, etc., but there are also special actions like propress, atifory, alful, adcry, spidene, pnestay. Maybe one of these actions applies here.\n\nThe mindly needs to be ropile. There's a mindly present. Ropile could be a verb. Maybe \"ropile\" is an action? But the allowed actions don't include that. Wait, the user mentioned that in addition to common actions, those special ones are allowed. So perhaps I need to use one of those. For example, maybe \"alful\" or \"adcry\" the mindly to make it ropile.\n\nThe oubiced ecastic. There's a uncepist here. Maybe \"oubiced\" is related to the uncepist? Maybe I need to make the uncepist ecastic.",
