	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can aling, vater and nogia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the secti in the imped, the inet on the table and the broom on the rably.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a book and a bed. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a nolog here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to put the secti in the imped, the inet on the table, and the broom on the rably. But first, I need to find those items. The current room is a bedroom with a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a nolog.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the items mentioned in the goal aren't here yet. Secti, imped, inet, table, broom, rablyâ€”none of those are listed in the current description. So maybe they're in other rooms or inside the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe I should open it first. Let me check. The user mentioned that possible actions include 'aling', 'vater', and 'nogia' besides common ones. But I'm not sure what those do yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the wardrobe is closed, opening it might reveal some items. Let me try that. If I open the wardrobe, maybe I can find one of the needed items inside. Alternatively, the book on the floor might be relevant. But the goal mentions a 'secti' and 'inet', which aren't standard items. Maybe they're in the wardrobe or in the nolog passage. Let's start with the wardrobe. Open it and see what's inside.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open wardrobe
