The current room is a bedroom with a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a nolog.\n\nHmm, the items mentioned in the goal aren't here yet. Secti, imped, inet, table, broom, rablyâ€”none of those are listed in the current description. So maybe they're in other rooms or inside the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe I should open it first. Let me check. The user mentioned that possible actions include 'aling', 'vater', and 'nogia' besides common ones. But I'm not sure what those do yet.\n\nSince the wardrobe is closed, opening it might reveal some items. Let me try that. If I open the wardrobe, maybe I can find one of the needed items inside. Alternatively, the book on the floor might be relevant. But the goal mentions a 'secti' and 'inet', which aren't standard items. Maybe they're in the wardrobe or in the nolog passage. Let's start with the wardrobe. Open it and see what's inside.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe",
