But first, I need to understand what objects are available and where they are.\n\nThe current room is a chross. There's a pillow on the incry, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The user mentioned some special actions: acion, shness, and arger. Maybe these are typos or specific commands in the game. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to find the arliced, comper, and comess. They might be items in the room or in the hallway. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it could reveal something. The book is on the floor, but I don't know if that's relevant. The pillow is on the incry, which might be a typo for \"incry\" (maybe \"in cry\" or \"on cry\"?). Maybe \"incry\" is a location or an object.\n\nSince the wardrobe is closed, maybe I should open it first. Let me try that. If I open the wardrobe, maybe I can find some items inside. Alternatively, maybe the book has something written on it that's useful. But the goal mentions specific items, so I need to locate them.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that in addition",
