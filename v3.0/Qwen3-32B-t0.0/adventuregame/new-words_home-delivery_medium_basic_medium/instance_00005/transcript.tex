	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a book and a incry. The pillow is on the incry. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to put the arliced in the atent, the comper on the table, and the comess on the distral. But first, I need to understand what objects are available and where they are.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room is a chross. There's a pillow on the incry, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The user mentioned some special actions: acion, shness, and arger. Maybe these are typos or specific commands in the game. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to find the arliced, comper, and comess. They might be items in the room or in the hallway. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it could reveal something. The book is on the floor, but I don't know if that's relevant. The pillow is on the incry, which might be a typo for "incry" (maybe "in cry" or "on cry"?). Maybe "incry" is a location or an object.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since the wardrobe is closed, maybe I should open it first. Let me try that. If I open the wardrobe, maybe I can find some items inside. Alternatively, maybe the book has something written on it that's useful. But the goal mentions specific items, so I need to locate them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user mentioned that in addition
