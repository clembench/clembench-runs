	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can lispe, degra and lones.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the setral in the iscad, the lablent on the mingnee and the eriat on the mingnee.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a book, a bed and a ovesish. The pillow is on the bed. The book is on the floor. The ovesish is closed. There is a passage to a olict here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to put the setral in the iscad, the lablent on the mingnee, and the eriat on the mingnee. First, I need to find these items. The current room has a pillow on the bed, a book on the floor, and a closed ovesish. There's also a passage to an olict.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the items mentioned in the goal (setral, lablent, eriat, iscad, mingnee) aren't in the current description. So maybe they're in other rooms. The ovesish is closed here, so maybe I need to open it first? Or maybe go through the passage to the olict? Let me think. Since the ovesish is closed, opening it might reveal something, but if the items I need are in another room, I should go there. The passage leads to an olict, so perhaps I should go there first. But I need to check if there's anything here I need to take. The book is on the floor; maybe I should pick it up? Wait, the book isn't part of the goal items. Maybe it's a red herring. The pillow is on the bed, but again, not part of the goal. The ovesish is closed, so maybe there's something inside. Let me try opening the ovesish first. If
