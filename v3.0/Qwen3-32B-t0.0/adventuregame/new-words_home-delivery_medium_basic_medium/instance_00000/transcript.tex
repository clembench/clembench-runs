	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can inate, pante and eness.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the subst in the unsust, the mical on the table and the maten on the dente.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a scont and a book. The pillow is on the scont. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a unree here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game, and I need to figure out the right actions based on the given objects and the goal. The goal is to put the subst in the unsust, the mical on the table, and the maten on the dente. Hmm, those are all probably objects that need to be placed in specific locations.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, looking at the current room: a bedroom with a pillow, wardrobe, scont, and a book. The pillow is on the scont, the wardrobe is closed, the book is on the floor, and there's a passage to a unree. The user can perform actions like inate, pante, and eness, along with common actions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the objects mentioned in the goal (subst, mical, maten) aren't in the current room description. So maybe they're in other rooms? The passage leads to a unree, so maybe I need to go there. But first, maybe I need to open the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed. Let me check if the wardrobe contains any of the needed items. If I open the wardrobe, maybe the subst, mical, or maten are inside. Alternatively, the book on the floor might have information, but the user hasn't read it yet. But the goal is to place specific items, so perhaps the first step is to open the wardrobe to access items inside. Let me try that. So
