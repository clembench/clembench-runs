Wait, but right now I'm in a bedroom with a pillow, ioness, wardrobe, and emingly. The emingly is on the floor. There's a passage to a routiced here.\n\nFirst, the emingly needs to go into the atival. But where is the atival? Maybe the atival is another room. The passage leads to a routiced, which I don't know yet. Maybe I need to go through the passage first to find the atival. But before that, I should pick up the emingly. So first action: pick up the emingly. Then go through the passage. Once there, put it in the atival. But I don't know what the routiced has. Also, I need to get the plate and mop on the reforia. The reforia might be in another room. So maybe after handling the emingly, I need to find the plate and mop. But the current room has a wardrobe that's closed. Maybe the plate and mop are inside? Or maybe in other rooms. Let me start by picking up the emingly first. Then go through the passage to explore.\n</think>\n\n> pick up emingly<|im_end|>",
