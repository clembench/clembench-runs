Right now, I'm in the ationee. The delly is on the floor here. So first, I need to pick up the delly. But before that, maybe I should check if there's anything else I need to do. The wardrobe is closed, but I don't see a plate or penol here. The pillow is on the bed, but that's probably not relevant. Since the delly is here, I should pick it up first. Then I need to go to the thot. Wait, where is the thot? The description mentions a passage to a het. Maybe the thot is in the het? So I should go through the passage to the het first. But wait, the delly is in the ationee. Maybe I need to take the delly with me. But first, pick it up. So the first action should be to pick up the delly. Then go to the het. Once there, put the delly in the thot. Then go find the plate and penol. But where are they? The plate is supposed to go on the micon, and the penol on the table. Maybe they are in the het or another room. But for now, the immediate step is to pick up the delly. So",
