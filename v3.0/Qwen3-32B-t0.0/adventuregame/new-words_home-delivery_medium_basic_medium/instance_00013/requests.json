The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to put three items in specific places: venism in the cunad, the book on the ciot, and the plate on the ciot. The current room is a bedroom with a wardrobe, book on the floor, venism on the bed, and a passage to a toxist.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what actions are possible. The standard actions are things like open, take, put, etc., but there are also some custom actions mentioned: itink, clogery, ambint. Not sure what those do yet. The goal is to place items in specific containers. \n\nLooking at the current state: the wardrobe is closed. The venism is on the bed. The book is on the floor. The plate isn't mentioned here, so maybe it's in another room, like the toxist? The user can go through the passage to the toxist. But first, maybe they need to get the venism from the bed. So the first step would be to take the venism. But the wardrobe is closed. Wait, does the wardrobe contain the cunad? Maybe the cunad is inside the wardrobe. So the user needs to open the wardrobe first. Then put the venism into the cunad. But the goal is to put venism in cunad, book and plate on ciot. \n\nSo possible steps: Open",
