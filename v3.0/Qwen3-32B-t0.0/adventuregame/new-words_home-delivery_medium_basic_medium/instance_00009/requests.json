The goal is to put the riack in the teming, the plate on the taillag, and the mop on the taillag. Wait, but in the current room, there's no mention of a plate or mop. The riack is on the floor, and the teming is closed. So first, I need to get the riack into the teming. Since the teming is closed, maybe I need to open it first. But the user can do actions like babile, ricary, and scidia, in addition to common ones. Hmm, not sure what those do. But standard actions would be like open, take, put.\n\nSo first, take the riack from the floor. Then open the teming. Then put the riack into the teming. But the user's goal also includes the plate and mop on the taillag. Since those items aren't mentioned in the bedroom, maybe they're in the hallway. So after handling the riack and teming, I should go to the hallway to find the plate and mop. But the current step is to put the riack in the teming. Let me start with taking the riack.\n</think>\n\n> take riack<|im_end|>",
