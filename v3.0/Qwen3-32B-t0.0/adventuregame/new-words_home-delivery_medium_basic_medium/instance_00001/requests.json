The goal is to put the aphon in the mator, the book on the remiced, and the proart on the table. Right now, the aphon is on the bed, the wardrobe is closed, the book is on the floor, and there's a passage to a hallway.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the mator, remiced, and table are. Since the current room has a wardrobe, a bed, and a passage to a hallway, maybe the other items are in different rooms. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it could reveal something? But the goal mentions a mator and a remiced, which aren't mentioned in the current description. The passage to the hallway might lead to other rooms where these objects are located.\n\nThe user can use actions like natin, perce, and trion. Not sure what those do yet. Maybe they're special actions for moving between rooms or interacting with objects. But the standard actions would be things like open, take, put, go to, etc.\n\nFirst step: The aphon is on the bed. Need to put it in the mator. But where is the mator? Since the current room doesn't mention it, maybe it's in the hallway or another room. So perhaps I need to go through the passage to the hallway first. Let me try that. So the first action could",
