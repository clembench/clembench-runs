	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can strood, eucty and pyell.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the oroust in the inchan, the book on the aciong and the plate on the aciong.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a encal now. There are a bed, a oroust, a wardrobe and a book. The oroust is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the oroust in the inchan, the book on the aciong, and the plate on the aciong. Wait, first I need to figure out where everything is. Right now, I'm in an encal (maybe a room like a bedroom). The oroust is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first thing I need to do is get the oroust off the bed. But where is the inchan? The inchan might be another location, maybe the hallway? Since there's a passage to a hallway here. Maybe I need to go to the hallway to find the inchan. But before that, I need to take the oroust from the bed. Let me check the possible actions. The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, I can strood, eucty, and pyell. Not sure what those do, but maybe they're typos? Like "strood" could be "stand" or "straddle"? Maybe "eucty" is "eject" and "pyell" is "pelt"? But I'll have to go with the given actions.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first, take the oroust from the bed. The oroust is on the bed. So maybe > take oroust from bed. But the allowed actions are like open, close, etc
