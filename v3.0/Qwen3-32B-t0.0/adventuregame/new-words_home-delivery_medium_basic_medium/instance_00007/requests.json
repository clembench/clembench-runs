Wait, first I need to figure out where everything is. Right now, I'm in an encal (maybe a room like a bedroom). The oroust is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is get the oroust off the bed. But where is the inchan? The inchan might be another location, maybe the hallway? Since there's a passage to a hallway here. Maybe I need to go to the hallway to find the inchan. But before that, I need to take the oroust from the bed. Let me check the possible actions. The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, I can strood, eucty, and pyell. Not sure what those do, but maybe they're typos? Like \"strood\" could be \"stand\" or \"straddle\"? Maybe \"eucty\" is \"eject\" and \"pyell\" is \"pelt\"? But I'll have to go with the given actions.\n\nSo first, take the oroust from the bed. The oroust is on the bed. So maybe > take oroust from bed. But the allowed actions are like open, close, etc",
