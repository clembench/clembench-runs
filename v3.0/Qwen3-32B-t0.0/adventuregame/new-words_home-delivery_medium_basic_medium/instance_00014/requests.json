Wait, where is the eleniced right now? The current description mentions a gicalio, chophal, book, and nophyle. The book is on the floor, nophyle is on the gicalio. The chophal is closed. There's also a passage to a hydroft.\n\nHmm, the eleniced isn't mentioned here. Maybe it's in another room, like the hydroft? So first, I need to get the nophyle from the gicalio. Then open the chophal to put it in. Then pick up the book from the floor and place it on the matiorm. But where is the matiorm? The current room has a chophal, gicalio, etc. Maybe the matiorm is in the same room? Wait, the user didn't mention a matiorm here. So maybe the matiorm is in the hydroft? Or perhaps I need to check other rooms.\n\nWait, the goal is to put the book and eleniced on the matiorm. Since the book is here on the floor, maybe the matiorm is in this room but not mentioned yet? Or maybe I need to go to the hydroft. Let me think. First",
