First, I need to find these items. The current room is a bedroom with a pillow on the prust, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a unflued.\n\nHmm, the items mentioned in the goal aren't here yet. Maybe they're in the unflued? Or inside the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe I should open it first. Let me check. If I open the wardrobe, maybe there's something inside. Alternatively, the passage to unflued might lead to another room where those items are. But I should start by exploring the current room first. The book is on the floor; maybe I can pick it up. Wait, the goal doesn't mention the book, but maybe it's a clue. Or perhaps the book is the \"pacia\"? Not sure. The pillow is on the prust. The prust might be a \"table\"? Maybe \"prust\" is a typo for \"mattress\" or \"prust\" is a table. But the goal says \"pacia on the table\". If the prust is a table, maybe the pillow is on the table already. But the pillow isn't one of the items in the goal.",
