	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tedne, sulphy and derman.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the sioust in the reele, the pacia on the table and the inging on the menny.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a book and a prust. The pillow is on the prust. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a unflued here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what actions to take here. The goal is to put the sioust in the reele, the pacia on the table, and the inging on the menny. First, I need to find these items. The current room is a bedroom with a pillow on the prust, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a unflued.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, the items mentioned in the goal aren't here yet. Maybe they're in the unflued? Or inside the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so maybe I should open it first. Let me check. If I open the wardrobe, maybe there's something inside. Alternatively, the passage to unflued might lead to another room where those items are. But I should start by exploring the current room first. The book is on the floor; maybe I can pick it up. Wait, the goal doesn't mention the book, but maybe it's a clue. Or perhaps the book is the "pacia"? Not sure. The pillow is on the prust. The prust might be a "table"? Maybe "prust" is a typo for "mattress" or "prust" is a table. But the goal says "pacia on the table". If the prust is a table, maybe the pillow is on the table already. But the pillow isn't one of the items in the goal.
