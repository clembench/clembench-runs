	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can ortid. To ortid is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism and the plate on the alism.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a wardrobe, a enerk, a book and a bed. The wardrobe is closed. The enerk is on the bed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. My goal is to put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism, and the plate on the alism. Wait, but in the current room description, there's a wardrobe, an enerk on the bed, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. Hmm, I don't see a table or an alism mentioned here. Maybe the alism is another object I need to find? Or perhaps it's in another room?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the table and alism are. Since the current room is the bedroom, and there's a passage to a hallway, maybe I need to go to the hallway to find those objects. But before that, let me check if there's anything else in the bedroom. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it could reveal more items. Let me try opening the wardrobe first. If there's a plate inside, that would help with putting it on the alism later. Also, maybe the table or alism is in the wardrobe? Or perhaps the alism is in the hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt So my first action should be to open the wardrobe. Let's do that.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open wardrobe
