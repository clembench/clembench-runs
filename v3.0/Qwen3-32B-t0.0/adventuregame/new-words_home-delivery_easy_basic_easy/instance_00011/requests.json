Wait, but in the current room description, there's a wardrobe, an enerk on the bed, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. Hmm, I don't see a table or an alism mentioned here. Maybe the alism is another object I need to find? Or perhaps it's in another room?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the table and alism are. Since the current room is the bedroom, and there's a passage to a hallway, maybe I need to go to the hallway to find those objects. But before that, let me check if there's anything else in the bedroom. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it could reveal more items. Let me try opening the wardrobe first. If there's a plate inside, that would help with putting it on the alism later. Also, maybe the table or alism is in the wardrobe? Or perhaps the alism is in the hallway.\n\nSo my first action should be to open the wardrobe. Let's do that.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe<|im_end|>",
