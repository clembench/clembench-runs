	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can aphon. To aphon is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord and the mop on the stord.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a enticed now. There are a bed, a decte, a pillow and a wardrobe. The decte is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord, and the mop on the stord. Wait, first I need to figure out where the table, stord, and mop are. The current room has a bed, decte on the floor, pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, and a passage to a hallway. Hmm, the decte is on the floor, so maybe I need to pick it up first. But where's the table? The table isn't mentioned here. Maybe the table is in the hallway? Or perhaps the wardrobe is a table? Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe I need to open the wardrobe to see if it's a table or a storage. Also, the stord is mentioned in the goal. Stord might be a typo for "storage," maybe the wardrobe is the storage. So first, I should check the wardrobe. Let me open the wardrobe to see what's inside. If there's a table or storage there, I can proceed. Alternatively, maybe the hallway has the table. But since the decte is here, I need to pick it up first. Wait, the decte is on the floor. So first action: pick up the decte. Then maybe go to the wardrobe. But the user mentioned "aphon" as placing something. So the steps would be: pick up decte,
