Wait, first I need to figure out where the table, stord, and mop are. The current room has a bed, decte on the floor, pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, and a passage to a hallway. Hmm, the decte is on the floor, so maybe I need to pick it up first. But where's the table? The table isn't mentioned here. Maybe the table is in the hallway? Or perhaps the wardrobe is a table? Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe I need to open the wardrobe to see if it's a table or a storage. Also, the stord is mentioned in the goal. Stord might be a typo for \"storage,\" maybe the wardrobe is the storage. So first, I should check the wardrobe. Let me open the wardrobe to see what's inside. If there's a table or storage there, I can proceed. Alternatively, maybe the hallway has the table. But since the decte is here, I need to pick it up first. Wait, the decte is on the floor. So first action: pick up the decte. Then maybe go to the wardrobe. But the user mentioned \"aphon\" as placing something. So the steps would be: pick up decte,",
