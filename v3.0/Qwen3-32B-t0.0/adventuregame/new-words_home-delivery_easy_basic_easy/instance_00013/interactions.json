But wait, the current room has a wardrobe, a book on the floor, a menny on the bed, and a passage to a hallway. No plate is mentioned here. So maybe the plate is in another room, like the hallway? First, I need to get the menny from the bed. Since the menny is on the bed, I should go there and prust it. Then the book is on the floor, so I can prust that too. But the plate isn't here. Maybe I need to go to the hallway to find the plate. But before moving, I should pick up the items here. Let me start with the menny. So the first action would be to prust the menny from the bed. Wait, the syntax for prust is to get something into possession. So maybe \"prust menny from bed\"? Or just \"prust menny\"? The example given was \"open cupboard\", so maybe \"prust menny\" while standing on the bed? But the description says the menny is on the bed. So perhaps I need to go to the bed first. Wait, but the current location is the bedroom, and the menny is on the bed. So maybe I can directly prust the menny. Let me try that first.\n</think>\n\n> prust menny",
