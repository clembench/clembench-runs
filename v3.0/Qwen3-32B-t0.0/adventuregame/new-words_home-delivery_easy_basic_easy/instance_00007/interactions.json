But in the current description, I don't see them listed. Maybe they're in another room? The passage leads to an imped, so maybe I need to go there. But first, the torish is closed, and I need to open it to put the orange and banana inside.

Wait, but the action \"stism\" is to block an opening. If the torish is closed, maybe it's already stised? So to open it, I might need to do the opposite of stism. But the available actions include stism. Wait, the user said that in addition to common actions, I can stism. So maybe to open the torish, I need to stism it?
