	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can comess. To comess is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper and the broom on the comper.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a tuat now. There are a book, a bed, a pillow and a wardrobe. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user is in a room called a tuat. The goal is to put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper, and the broom on the comper. Wait, first I need to figure out where these items are. The current description mentions a book on the floor, a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, and a passage to a hallway. But there's no mention of a lator, mop, broom, table, or comper here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe the items are in the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed, I should open it first. Let me check. If I open the wardrobe, maybe the lator, mop, and broom are inside. Then I can take them and place them where needed. But the goal mentions a table and a comper. The current room doesn't have a table listed. Wait, maybe the table is in the hallway? The user can go through the passage to the hallway. But first, I need to find the items. Let's start by opening the wardrobe to see what's inside.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open wardrobe
