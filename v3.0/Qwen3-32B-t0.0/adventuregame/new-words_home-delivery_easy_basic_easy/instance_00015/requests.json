The goal is to put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper, and the broom on the comper. Wait, first I need to figure out where these items are. The current description mentions a book on the floor, a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, and a passage to a hallway. But there's no mention of a lator, mop, broom, table, or comper here.\n\nHmm, maybe the items are in the wardrobe? Since the wardrobe is closed, I should open it first. Let me check. If I open the wardrobe, maybe the lator, mop, and broom are inside. Then I can take them and place them where needed. But the goal mentions a table and a comper. The current room doesn't have a table listed. Wait, maybe the table is in the hallway? The user can go through the passage to the hallway. But first, I need to find the items. Let's start by opening the wardrobe to see what's inside.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe<|im_end|>",
