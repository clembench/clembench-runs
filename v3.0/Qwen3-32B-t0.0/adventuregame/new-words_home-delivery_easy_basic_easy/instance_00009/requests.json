The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to put three items in specific places: the ousnee on the table, the potted plant on the delly, and the peach on the delly.

Maybe the table is in the hallway? Also, \"delly\" might be a typo, perhaps \"dell\" or \"dolly\"? Or maybe it's a specific object in the game. Since the user can \"unalin,\" which means to make something unobstructed and uncover its contents, maybe some objects are closed or covered and need to be opened first.\n\nFirst, check the wardrobe. It's closed, so maybe opening it will reveal some items. Let's try opening the wardrobe. If there's a table in the hallway, maybe the ousnee is there. But the current location is the bedroom. The book is on the floor; maybe it's needed to get to the hallway? Or perhaps the passage is just a way to move there. The user might need to go to the hallway first to find the table.
