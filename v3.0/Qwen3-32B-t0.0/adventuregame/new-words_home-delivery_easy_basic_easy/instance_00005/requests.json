The current room has a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The items I need aren't here yet.\n\nSince the wardrobe is closed, maybe opening it could reveal something. Let me try opening the wardrobe. If there's nothing inside, I'll check the hallway next. If the items aren't here, I might need to go to the hallway to look further. Alternatively, maybe the book has clues? But the goal mentions specific items, so probably they are in other rooms. Let's start with opening the wardrobe.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe<|im_end|>",
