	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

To sious is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the unflued on the table, the plate in the pacia and the mop in the pacia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a uncest now. There are a pacia, a pillow, a unflued and a bed. The pacia is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The unflued is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. My goal is to put the unflued on the table, the plate in the pacia, and the mop in the pacia. Wait, the current description says there's a pacia, which is closed. So first, I need to open the pacia to put things inside. But before that, I need to check where the plate and mop are. The current room has a pacia, pillow on the bed, unflued on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The plate and mop aren't mentioned here. Maybe they're in the hallway? So I should go to the hallway first to find them.\\ \tt \\ \tt But first, the unflued is on the floor. I need to put it on the table. Wait, the table isn't mentioned. The pacia is a type of table? Maybe "pacia" is a typo for "pantry" or "table". But the user says "put the plate in the pacia", so pacia is probably a container. So first, I need to open the pacia. But the unflued is on the floor. Let me pick that up first. Then put it on the table. Wait, but where is the table? The pacia is a closed container. Maybe the table is the pacia? Or maybe there's a table elsewhere. The initial description says "You are in a uncest now." Maybe "uncest" is a
