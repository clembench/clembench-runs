	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tedne. To tedne is to get something into one's hands, possession or control.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman and the plate on the derman.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a wardrobe, a book, a bed and a ramiced. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The ramiced is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the ramiced is on the bed. To put it on the table, I need to find a table. But there's no table mentioned in the bedroom. Maybe the table is in the hallway? So I should go to the hallway first. But before that, maybe check the wardrobe. The wardrobe is closed, so I should open it. If there's a plate inside, I can take it. Then, go to the hallway to find the derman and table. Alternatively, maybe the derman is in this room but not mentioned? Wait, the user said "You are in a bedroom now.
