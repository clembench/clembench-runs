	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. My goal is to put the subst on the table, the book on the scont, and the plate on the scont. Wait, but in the current room description, there's a bedroom with a wardrobe, a subst, a book, and a bed. The subst is on the bed. The book is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the table and scont are. The problem is, the current room doesn't mention a table or a scont. The subst is already mentioned, but it's on the bed. Maybe the table and scont are in the hallway? Since there's a passage to a hallway, I might need to go there. But before that, I need to get the subst off the bed. Also, there's a book on the floor here. The plate isn't mentioned here, so maybe it's in the hallway as well. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions a plate on the scont. But the current room doesn't have a plate. So perhaps the plate is in the hallway or another room. But first, I need to get the subst to the table. But where is the table? Since the current room doesn't have a table, maybe I need to go to the hallway. Let me check the steps:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Take the subst from the bed. But the subst is on the bed. So first, I need to pick
