First, I need to figure out where these items are and what actions are needed.\n\nThe current location is a bedroom with a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The items needed (penol, mop, broom) aren't mentioned here. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe the items are inside? Or perhaps they're in the hallway? Since there's a passage to the hallway, maybe the next step is to go there. But wait, the user hasn't mentioned a table or micon yet. Maybe the table and micon are in the hallway? Or maybe the micon is part of the bedroom furniture not listed? Hmm.\n\nWait, the initial description says the bedroom has a pillow, wardrobe, book, and bed. No table or micon. So the table and micon might be in another room, like the hallway. So first, I need to go to the hallway. But before that, check if the wardrobe has any items. The wardrobe is closed, so maybe opening it will reveal the penol, mop, or broom. Let me try opening the wardrobe first. If that doesn't work, then go to the hallway. Let's start with opening the wardrobe.",
