The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to put three items in specific locations: the nogia on the table, the potted plant in the aling, and the peach in the aling. First, I need to figure out where these items are and what actions are needed.\n\nThe current location is a bedroom with a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to a hallway. The goal items aren't listed here yet. The user might need to search the room for these items. Since the wardrobe is closed, maybe opening it would reveal some items. The book is on the floor; maybe checking inside the book or under the pillow? Also, \"vater\" is an action here, which means to unobstruct or uncover something. So maybe using \"vater\" on the wardrobe to open it?\n\nBut the immediate step is to find the items. The first thing to do is probably open the wardrobe to see if any of the goal items are inside. Let me check the possible actions. The user can interact with the wardrobe by opening it. So the first action should be to open the wardrobe. If that's successful, then maybe the items are inside, or perhaps in another location like the hallway. But since the user is in the bedroom, starting with opening the wardrobe makes sense. If the wardrobe has items, then take them and proceed. If not, move to the",
