	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the potted plant on the table, the book in the refrigerator and the mop in the wardrobe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a kitchen now. There are a cupboard, a plate and a counter. The cupboard is closed. The plate is in the cupboard. There are passages to a hallway and a pantry here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to put the potted plant on the table, the book in the refrigerator, and the mop in the wardrobe. But right now, I'm in the kitchen with a closed cupboard, a plate inside it, and there's a counter. The passages lead to a hallway and a pantry.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the objects are. The potted plant, book, and mop aren't mentioned here. The cupboard is closed, so maybe opening it will reveal more items. The plate is already in the cupboard, but I need other things. Since the goal requires three specific items, I probably need to go to other rooms like the hallway or pantry to find them. But before moving, maybe I should open the cupboard to check if any of the needed objects are there. The plate is in the cupboard, but that's not one of the items I need. However, maybe there's more inside. So the first action should be to open the cupboard. Let me do that.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open cupboard
