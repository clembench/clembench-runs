The user is playing a text adventure game and needs to put three items in specific places: the pillow in the freezer, the broom on the bed, and the plate on the table. The current location is a hallway with a potted plant on the floor, and passages to the living room, broom closet, and kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where each item is. The pillow, broom, and plate aren't mentioned in the current room. The potted plant is here, but that's not one of the target items. So I need to explore the other rooms to find those items.\n\nThe goal requires accessing a freezer, which is probably in the kitchen. The broom might be in the broom closet, which is directly accessible from the hallway. The plate could be in the kitchen or the living room. The bed is likely in the living room or another room connected from there.\n\nSince the broom closet is a direct passage, maybe I should check there first for the broom. If the broom is there, take it and then go to the bed, which might be in the living room. Then, go to the kitchen for the freezer and plate. But I need to make sure I don't exceed the inventory limit of two items. So maybe pick up the broom from the broom closet first, then go to the kitchen to get the plate and pillow. Wait, the pillow needs to go",
