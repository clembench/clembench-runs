I need to put the sandwich in the freezer, the book in the wardrobe, and the mop on the table. But right now, I'm in a broom closet with a mop and a broom on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway.\n\nFirst, the mop is here. The goal says to put the mop on the table. But wait, there's no table mentioned in the current location. The passage leads to a hallway, so maybe the table is there. But before moving, I should check if I can take the mop. Since I can carry up to two objects, I need to pick up the mop first. So the first action should be to take the mop. But wait, the mop is on the floor here. So I should take it. Then, I need to go to the hallway to find the table. But the user's current location is the broom closet. So the next step after taking the mop would be to go through the passage to the hallway. But the user's first action here is to take the mop. Let me confirm: the mop is in the broom closet, so taking it makes sense. Then proceed to the hallway. But the user's first move should be to take the mop. So the first action is > take mop. Then, go to the hallway. But the user's first action here is to take the mop. So the first response should be > take mop",
