	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the sandwich on the side table, the book on the shelf and the mop in the cupboard.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a kitchen now. There are a cupboard, a plate and a counter. The cupboard is closed. The plate is in the cupboard. There are passages to a living room, a hallway and a pantry here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the sandwich on the side table, the book on the shelf, and the mop in the cupboard. But right now, I'm in the kitchen. The cupboard is closed, and there's a plate inside. The passages lead to the living room, hallway, and pantry.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the sandwich, book, and mop are. Since I'm in the kitchen, maybe some items are here, but the cupboard is closed. The plate is in the cupboard, but I need to open it to see if there's anything else. Wait, the mop might be in the cupboard? Or maybe in another room. The sandwich and book might be in other areas like the living room, hallway, or pantry.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the first step is probably to open the cupboard to check what's inside. The plate is there, but maybe the mop is also in the cupboard. However, the goal is to put the mop in the cupboard, so maybe it's not there yet. So I need to open the cupboard to access it. Let me start by opening the cupboard.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > open cupboard
