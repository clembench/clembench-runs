	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table and the mop on the shelf.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a book, a table, a couch and a chair. The book is on the table. There are passages to a bedroom and a kitchen here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table, and the mop on the shelf. I'm in the living room with a book on the table, and there are passages to a bedroom and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where the apple, plate, and mop are. The book is here, but the other items might be in the bedroom or kitchen. Since the freezer is likely in the kitchen, maybe the apple is there or needs to go there. The plate might be in the kitchen or bedroom, and the mop could be in the kitchen as well. Let me check the kitchen first because that's where the freezer is. So the next step is to go to the kitchen to look for the apple and maybe the other items. If I go to the kitchen, I can then access the freezer to put the apple in. Then I can check where the plate and mop are and move them accordingly. Let's start by moving to the kitchen.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > go to kitchen
