I'm in the living room with a side table, couch, chair, and shelf. Passages to hallway, bedroom, and kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to find the book, sandwich, and broom. Since they aren't mentioned here, maybe they're in other rooms. Let me think. The book might be on the couch or chair. The sandwich could be in the kitchen, maybe on the table there. The broom might be in the hallway or bedroom, perhaps near a counter.\n\nI should start by checking nearby objects. Maybe the book is on the couch. Let me look there first. If the book isn't here, I might need to go to another room. But since I can carry up to two items, I need to plan the order. Maybe get the book first, then the sandwich, then the broom. But I need to check where each item is.\n\nWait, the shelf is in the living room, so once I have the book, I can put it there. The side table is here, so maybe the sandwich can go there? But the goal says sandwich on the table. The side table is part of the living room, but maybe the kitchen has a table. The user mentioned a passage to a kitchen.
