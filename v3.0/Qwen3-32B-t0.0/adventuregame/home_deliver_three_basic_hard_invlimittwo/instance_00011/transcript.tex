	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the book on the shelf, the sandwich on the table and the broom on the counter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a side table, a couch, a chair and a shelf. There are passages to a hallway, a bedroom and a kitchen here.

Passages to hallway, bedroom, and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to find the book, sandwich, and broom. Since they aren't mentioned here, maybe they're in other rooms. Let me think. The book might be on the couch or chair. The sandwich could be in the kitchen, maybe on the table there. The broom might be in the hallway or bedroom, perhaps near a counter.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should start by checking nearby objects. Maybe the book is on the couch. Let me look there first. If the book isn't here, I might need to go to another room. But since I can carry up to two items, I need to plan the order. Maybe get the book first, then the sandwich, then the broom. But I need to check where each item is.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the shelf is in the living room, so once I have the book, I can put it there. The side table is here, so maybe the sandwich can go there? But the goal says sandwich on the table. The side table is part of the living room, but maybe the kitchen has a table. The user mentioned a passage to a kitchen. So perhaps the sandwich is in the kitchen, and the table is
