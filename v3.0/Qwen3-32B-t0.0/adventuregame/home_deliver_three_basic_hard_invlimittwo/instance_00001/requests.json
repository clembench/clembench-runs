I need to put the sandwich in the freezer, the plate on the shelf, and the mop on the table. But right now, I'm in a bedroom with a pillow, a wardrobe, and a bed. The pillow is inside the closed wardrobe. There's also a passage to a hallway.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the sandwich, plate, and mop are. Since they aren't mentioned here, maybe they're in other rooms. The hallway is accessible, so I should go there next. But before leaving, maybe check the wardrobe? The pillow is in there, but I don't need the pillow. Wait, the goal doesn't mention the pillow. So maybe the wardrobe has something else? No, the description says the pillow is in the wardrobe, and the wardrobe is closed. But since my goal items aren't here, I should probably go to the hallway to find other rooms where the sandwich, plate, and mop might be. Let me open the wardrobe first to see if there's anything else inside. If there's nothing useful, I'll go to the hallway.\n</think>\n\n> open wardrobe<|im_end|>",
