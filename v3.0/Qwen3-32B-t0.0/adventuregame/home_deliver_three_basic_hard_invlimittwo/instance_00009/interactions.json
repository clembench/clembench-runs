The apple is in the refrigerator, which is closed. So first, I need to open the refrigerator to get the apple. Wait, but the user mentioned the apple is in the refrigerator. So my first step should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the objects here: there's a freezer (closed), refrigerator (closed), and other items. So I need to open the refrigerator first to take the apple. Then, once I have the apple, I can put it in the cupboard. But wait, the goal mentions a cupboard, but the current location is a pantry. Is there a cupboard here? The description says there's a passage to a kitchen. Maybe the cupboard is in another room. Hmm, but I need to check. Wait, the user didn't mention a cupboard in the current room. So maybe after opening the refrigerator and taking the apple, I need to go to the kitchen? But the goal is to put the apple in the cupboard. Maybe the kitchen has a cupboard. So first, open the refrigerator, take the apple, then go to the kitchen, then put it in the cupboard. But I can only carry two objects at a time. But right now, I need to focus on the apple first. So first action is to open the refrigerator",
