I need to put the potted plant in the freezer, the plate on the table, and the mop in the refrigerator. But right now, I'm in a bedroom with a pillow, wardrobe, and bed. The pillow is in the closed wardrobe. There's a passage to a hallway.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the objects I need are. The potted plant, plate, and mop aren't mentioned here. The current items are pillow, wardrobe (closed), bed. The pillow is inside the wardrobe, which is closed. So maybe I need to open the wardrobe first. But the goal doesn't mention the pillow, so maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps the wardrobe has other items? Wait, the problem says my goal is to place three specific items. So maybe the potted plant, plate, and mop are in other rooms. Since I'm in the bedroom, I need to go to the hallway first. The passage leads to a hallway, so maybe I should go there next. But before leaving, maybe check the wardrobe? Let me open the wardrobe to see if there's anything else inside. The pillow is there, but maybe other items? If there's nothing, then I need to move to the hallway and explore from there. The next step is probably to open the wardrobe to check contents, then proceed to the hallway if nothing is here.
