I'm in the living room with a book on the side table, and there are passages to a hallway, bedroom, and kitchen.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where each object is. The broom, potted plant, and plate aren't mentioned here. So they must be in other rooms. The living room has a book, but that's not needed. The next step is to explore the connected rooms to find those items.\n\nSince I can go to the hallway, bedroom, or kitchen, I should check each one. Let's start with the kitchen because counters and wardrobes are often there. Maybe the potted plant is in the living room, but no, it's mentioned on the side table. Wait, the book is on the side table. The potted plant isn't here. So I need to go to another room.\n\nLet me go to the kitchen first. Maybe the plate is there, and the counter is in the kitchen. The broom might be in the hallway or bedroom. The wardrobe is likely in the bedroom. So plan: go to kitchen to find the plate and counter, then bedroom for the wardrobe and maybe broom. But need to check each room.\n\nFirst action: go to the kitchen. Let's see what's there. If the plate is there,",
