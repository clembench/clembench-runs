	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the potted plant on the side table, the plate on the shelf and the mop in the freezer.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a chair and a shelf. There are passages to a hallway, a bedroom and a kitchen here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The goal is to put the potted plant on the side table, the plate on the shelf, and the mop in the freezer. I'm in the living room with a couch, chair, shelf, and passages to hallway, bedroom, and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to find the potted plant, plate, and mop. Since the living room has a shelf, maybe the plate is here? But the shelf is mentioned, but I don't know if the plate is on it or elsewhere. The potted plant might be in the living room too, maybe on the couch or chair? Or perhaps in another room. The mop is likely in the kitchen or hallway? The freezer is probably in the kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, first step: check the living room for any of the items. If I don't find them, I need to go to other rooms. Let me start by looking around. Maybe the potted plant is here. If not, I need to go to other areas. Since I can carry two items, I need to plan the order. Maybe get the plate first, put it on the shelf. Then get the plant and put it on the side table. Then go to the kitchen and put the mop in the freezer. But I need to find each item first. Let me check the living room first. If the plate is here, take it. If not, maybe check the shelf. If the shelf is empty, maybe
