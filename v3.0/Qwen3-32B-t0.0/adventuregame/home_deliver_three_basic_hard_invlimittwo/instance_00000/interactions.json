The goal items must be in other rooms. Since I can only carry two objects at a time, I need to plan my trips.\n\nWait, the problem is that I don't see the pillow, book, or plate here. So the next step must be to move to the hallway to find them. Let me check the hallway. Once I go there, I can look for those items. But I need to remember that I can only carry two at a time, so maybe I'll have to go back and forth. But first, I need to get out of the closet. So the first action should be to go through the passage to the hallway.\n</think>\n\n> go to hallway",
