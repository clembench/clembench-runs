First, I should figure out where each of these items is. The current room is the living room with a side table, table, couch, and chair. There's also a passage to a hallway.\n\nI should start by checking the obvious places. Maybe the pillow is on the couch or chair. The book might be on the table or side table. The plate could be on the table as well. Let me check each piece of furniture one by one.\n\nFirst, the couch. If there's a pillow there, I can take it. Then check the chair. If not, maybe the side table or the main table. Once I have the pillow, I need to take it to the refrigerator, which might be in the hallway. But before moving items, I need to collect them all. So maybe first take the pillow, then the book, then the plate. But I can only carry two items at a time. Wait, the inventory allows two objects. So if I pick up the pillow and the book, I can't carry the plate. Hmm. So maybe I need to do this in steps. Take the pillow and book first, put them where they need to go, then go back for the plate. Or take the plate first. Let me think.\n\nBut first, I need to find all the items. Let's",
