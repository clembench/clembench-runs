So maybe take the recipe and then another item needed. But right now, the immediate step is to take the potion recipe. So the action would be to take it from the bed. Let me make sure there's no other action needed first. The wardrobe is closed, but maybe that's for later. The book is there too, but the recipe is the priority.
