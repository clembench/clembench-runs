	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is to brew a potion following the potion recipe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a bed, a potion recipe and a book. The pillow is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The potion recipe is on the bed. The book is on the bed. There is a passage to a reading room here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to brew a potion following the recipe. The first step is probably to get the recipe. The potion recipe is on the bed, so I should pick that up. Let me check the surroundings again. The bed has the recipe and a book. Maybe the book has information on how to brew it? But the immediate step is to take the recipe. So, take potion recipe from bed. Then, maybe read it to know the ingredients. But the action here is just taking it. The wardrobe is closed, but there's no indication I need something from there yet. The passage to the reading room might have more items. But starting with the recipe makes sense.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > take potion recipe from bed
