The potion recipe is on the bed, so I should pick that up. Let me check the surroundings again. The bed has the recipe and a book. Maybe the book has information on how to brew it? But the immediate step is to take the recipe. So, take potion recipe from bed. Then, maybe read it to know the ingredients. But the action here is just taking it. The wardrobe is closed, but there's no indication I need something from there yet. The passage to the reading room might have more items. But starting with the recipe makes sense.\n</think>\n\n> take potion recipe from bed<|im_end|>",
