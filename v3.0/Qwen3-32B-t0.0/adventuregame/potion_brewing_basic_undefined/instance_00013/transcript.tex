	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is to brew a potion following the potion recipe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a bed, a potion recipe and a book. The pillow is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The potion recipe is on the bed. The book is on the bed. There is a passage to a reading room here.

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to brew a potion following the recipe. The first step is probably to get the potion recipe. It's on the bed, so I should take that. But wait, the bed is where the recipe and the book are. Maybe I need to pick up the recipe first. Let me check the inventory limitâ€”can only hold two items. So maybe take the recipe and then another item needed. But right now, the immediate step is to take the potion recipe. So the action would be to take it from the bed. Let me make sure there's no other action needed first. The wardrobe is closed, but maybe that's for later. The book is there too, but the recipe is the priority. So take the potion recipe from the bed.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt > take potion recipe from bed
