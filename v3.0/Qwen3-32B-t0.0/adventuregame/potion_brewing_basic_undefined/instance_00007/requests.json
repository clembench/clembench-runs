The first step is probably to get the potion recipe. It's on the bed, so I should take that. But wait, the bed is where the recipe and the book are. Maybe I need to pick up the recipe first. Let me check the inventory limit—can only hold two items. So maybe take the recipe and then another item needed. But right now, the immediate step is to take the potion recipe. So the action would be to take it from the bed. Let me make sure there's no other action needed first. The wardrobe is closed, but maybe that's for later. The book is there too, but the recipe is the priority. So take the potion recipe from the bed.\n</think>\n\n> take potion recipe from bed<|im_end|>",
