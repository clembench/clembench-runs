Let me look at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid has the first three columns as empty (all ▢) and the last two columns filled with X's. Each row in the target is ▢▢▢XX repeated five times. So it's like a block of empty cells on the left and filled on the right. \n\nDistractor 1: The first two columns are empty, then three X's. So each row is ▢▢XXX. The difference here is the number of leading empty columns. Target has three empty, distractor 1 has two.\n\nDistractor 2: The first column is X, then two empty, then two X's. So each row is X▢▢XX. So here, the first column is filled, whereas the target has the first three columns empty.\n\nSo to distinguish the target from both distractors, I need to mention that the first three columns are empty and the last two are filled. Distractor 1 has two empty columns, so specifying three would set it apart. Distractor 2 has the first column filled, so saying the first three are empty would exclude that. \n\nAlso, checking if there are other features. All grids are 5x5. The target has a solid block of X's on the right two columns. Maybe mention that the filled cells are",
