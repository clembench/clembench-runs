Let me start by analyzing each grid.\n\nThe target grid has the first row all filled with X's. Then the next two rows are all empty (□), followed by another row of all X's, and the last row is empty again. So the pattern is: filled row, empty row, empty row, filled row, empty row.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1: The first column is all empty except the last three rows have X's in the fourth and fifth columns. Wait, no, let me check again. Distractor 1's rows are each starting with three □ and then two X's. So each row is □□□XX, repeated five times. So it's like a vertical block on the left side, and a vertical block of X's on the right. But all rows are the same. So the X's are in columns 4 and 5 for every row.\n\nDistractor 2 has the first two columns empty and the last three columns filled with X's. Each row is □□XXX. So all rows have X's in columns 3,4,5. So that's a vertical block on the left, and a vertical block of X's on the right, but wider than Distractor 1.\n\nThe target grid's X's are",
