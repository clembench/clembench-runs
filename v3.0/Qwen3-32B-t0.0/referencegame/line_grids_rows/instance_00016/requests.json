Let me look at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. Looking at the rows: each row starts with a □, then two Xs, another □, and ends with an X. So the pattern is □ X X □ X repeated for each row. So every row has the same structure. The filled cells (Xs) are in columns 2, 3, and 5, with the first and fourth columns empty. So each row has three Xs in positions 2, 3, 5.\n\nNow, Distractor 1: Each row starts with two □s, then three Xs. So the pattern is □ □ X X X. So in this grid, the first two columns are empty, and columns 3,4,5 are filled. Each row has three Xs, but their positions are different from the target. So the key difference here is the placement of the Xs. Target has Xs in columns 2,3,5, while D1 has them in 3,4,5.\n\nDistractor 2 is different. The first row is all Xs (X X X X X), then two rows of all □s, then a row of Xs again, then �",
