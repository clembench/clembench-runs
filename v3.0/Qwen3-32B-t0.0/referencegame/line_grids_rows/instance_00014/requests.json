Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nThe target grid is a 5x5 grid. Looking at each row, the first two columns are filled with X's, then a blank (□), followed by two X's. So each row is X X □ X X. This pattern repeats for all five rows. So the target grid has a vertical line of blanks in the third column, with X's on either side.\n\nNow, Distractor 1: Each row is X □ □ X X. So here, the first column is X, then two blanks, then two X's. The difference here is that there are two blank columns (columns 2 and 3) instead of one. The target has one blank in column 3, while D1 has two blanks starting at column 2.\n\nDistractor 2: The first three columns are all blank (□ □ □ X X). So three blanks followed by two X's. So columns 1-3 are blank here. The target has X's in columns 1 and 2, then a blank in 3. So D2 has more blanks on the left.\n\nSo the key differences are the position and number of blank columns. The target has a single blank column (column 3), while D1",
