Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nThe target grid is a 5x5 grid. Each row starts with an X, then two empty cells (□), followed by two Xs. So the pattern is X □ □ X X repeated for each row. Let me check the rows one by one to confirm. Yes, every row in the target is the same: first column is X, columns 2 and 3 are empty, columns 4 and 5 are X. So it's consistent across all five rows.\n\nNow, Distractor 1 has the first column all empty (□ □ □ X X for each row). So instead of starting with X, it starts with three empty cells. The last two columns are Xs, same as the target. So the main difference here is the first column: target has Xs there, distractor 1 has empties.\n\nDistractor 2 has the first two columns filled with Xs (X X □ X X). The third column is empty, then Xs again. So the difference here is that in the target, the first column is X and the second and third are empty, whereas in distractor 2, the first two columns are X and the third is empty. \n\nSo the key features of the",
