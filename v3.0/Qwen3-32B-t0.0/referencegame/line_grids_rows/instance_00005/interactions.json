The target grid is the first one, followed by two others.\n\nLooking at the target grid: Each row starts with two empty cells (marked as □) followed by three filled cells (X). So, every row is □ □ X X X. There are five rows like that. So the pattern is consistent across all rows. \n\nNow, Distractor 1 has rows that start with three empty cells and then two Xs. So each row is □ □ □ X X. That's four rows of that, but wait, the user provided five rows. Wait, looking back, the target grid has five rows, each with two empties then three Xs. Distractor 1's rows have three empties then two Xs. So the key difference here is the number of leading empty cells and the number of Xs following. \n\nDistractor 2 has each row starting with an X, then two empties, then two Xs. So the pattern is X □ □ X X. So the first column is all Xs, then two empties, then two Xs. \n\nSo the target grid's unique feature is that each row has exactly two empty cells followed by three Xs. Both distractors have different numbers here. Distractor 1 has",
