Let me start by analyzing each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Looking at it, each row starts with two empty cells (marked as □) followed by three filled cells (X). So every row is □ □ X X X. That's consistent across all five rows. So the pattern is two empty on the left, three filled on the right in each row.\n\nNow, Distractor 1. Each row here starts with an X, then □ □, then two Xs. So the pattern is X □ □ X X. And this repeats for all rows. So the filled cells are in columns 1, 4, 5, while the target has them in columns 3,4,5. Also, Distractor 1 has the first column all Xs, which the target doesn't.\n\nDistractor 2 has a different pattern. Each row is □ X X X □. So the first and last cells are empty, and the middle three are filled. So columns 2,3,4 are filled. The target has columns 3,4,5 filled. So the filled area is shifted to the right in the target compared to Distractor 2.\n\nSo the key differences are the position of the filled cells. The target",
