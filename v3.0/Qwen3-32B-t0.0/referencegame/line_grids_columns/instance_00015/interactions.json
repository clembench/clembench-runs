Let me start by analyzing each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Looking at it, each row has the pattern X, empty, X, X, empty. So every row is X □ X X □. That's consistent across all five rows. So the filled cells (X's) are in columns 1, 3, 4, and the empty ones in 2 and 5. Wait, no, each row has X in positions 1, 3, 4. Wait, let me count again. First row: X, □, X, X, □. So columns 1, 3, 4 have Xs. So each row has three Xs and two □s. And this pattern repeats for all five rows.\n\nNow, Distractor 1: All rows start with three □s followed by three Xs? Wait, looking at D1's first row: □ □ X X X. So columns 3,4,5 are Xs. But in the target grid, the Xs are in columns 1,3,4. So D1's Xs are in columns 3-5, while target's are in 1,3,4. Also, D1 has three Xs per row,",
