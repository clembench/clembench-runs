Let me look at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid has the first three columns filled with X's and the last two columns empty. So each row starts with three Xs followed by two □s. \n\nDistractor 1 has a column of □s in the first column, then three Xs, then a □. So each row is □ X X X □. That's different because the first column is empty and the fourth is empty. The target's empty columns are the last two, so maybe mention the position of the empty columns.\n\nDistractor 2 has a pattern of □ X X □ X. So columns 1 and 4 are empty, and column 5 is filled. The target doesn't have that. \n\nSo the key differences are the placement of the empty columns. Target has columns 4 and 5 empty. Distractor 1 has columns 1 and 4 empty. Distractor 2 has columns 1 and 4 empty but also column 5 filled. \n\nSo I need to describe the target's empty columns as the last two. Maybe say \"the first three columns are completely filled with Xs, and the last two columns are entirely empty.\" That should distinguish it from both distractors.
