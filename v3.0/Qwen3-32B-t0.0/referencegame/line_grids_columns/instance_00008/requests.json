Let me look at all three grids again.\n\nTarget grid:\nRow 1: □ X X X □\nRow 2: □ X X X □\nRow 3: □ X X X □\nRow 4: □ X X X □\nRow 5: □ X X X □\n\nDistractor 1:\nEach row starts with two □, then three X. So like □ □ X X X for each row.\n\nDistractor 2:\nEach row starts with three X, then two □. So X X X □ □ for each row.\n\nThe target grid has a single □ on each end of each row. So each row is □ followed by three X and then another □. So the pattern is □ X X X □. \n\nComparing to the distractors: Distractor 1 has two □ at the start and then three X. Distractor 2 has three X first, then two □. The target is different because each row has a □ at the beginning and end, with three X in the middle. So maybe I can describe it as having a single empty cell on each side of each row, or the filled cells forming a vertical",
