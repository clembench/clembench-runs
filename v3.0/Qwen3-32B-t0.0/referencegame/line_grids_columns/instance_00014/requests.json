Let me look at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid has a pattern where each row starts with a □, then two Xs, then a □, and ends with an X. So like □ X X □ X repeated for each row. All rows are the same. \n\nDistractor 1 has rows that start with two □s, then three Xs. So each row is □ □ X X X. All rows are identical. \n\nDistractor 2 has rows starting with □, then three Xs, then a □. So □ X X X □. Again, all rows the same.\n\nSo the target's pattern is different in the arrangement of Xs and □s. Let me think about how to phrase this. The key differences are in the positions of the empty cells. \n\nIn the target, each row has two empty cells: the first and the fourth positions. Distractor 1 has two empty cells at the start, and Distractor 2 has one at the start and one at the end. \n\nSo maybe I can mention that the target has empty cells in the first and fourth columns of each row. Alternatively, describe the filled columns. For the target, columns 2, 3, and 5 are filled with Xs, while",
