Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid has a pattern where the first column is all X's, then the next two columns are all empty (□), and the last two columns are all X's. So each row is X □ □ X X repeated five times. So vertically, the first column is fully filled, columns 2 and 3 are empty, and columns 4 and 5 are filled.\n\nNow, Distractor 1: The first two columns are empty, then columns 3,4,5 are filled. So each row is □ □ X X X. That's different because the filled columns start earlier. The target has the first column filled, while D1 has the first two empty. So mentioning the first column being filled would help distinguish.\n\nDistractor 2 has a different pattern. Looking at it, each row is X □ X X □. So columns 1 and 3 are X, column 5 is empty. So it alternates X and empty in some way. The target doesn't have that; it's more about blocks of columns. So D2's pattern is more scattered in columns, while the target has solid columns.\n\nSo the key differences are the column patterns. Target has first column all X, then two empty, then",
