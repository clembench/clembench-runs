I need to create a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid is:\n\nRow 1: X X □ □ X\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X □ X X\nRow 5: X □ □ X X\n\nDistractor 1:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X □\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X □\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X □ X\n\nDistractor 2 is a checkerboard pattern alternating X and □ in each cell.\n\nNow, I need to find features unique to the target grid. Let me compare each row and column.\n\nLooking at the first row of the target: X X □ □ X. Distractor 1's first row is X X □ X □. So in position (1,4), target has □ while distractor 1 has X. That's a difference. Distractor 2's first row is □ X □ X □, so different in multiple positions",
