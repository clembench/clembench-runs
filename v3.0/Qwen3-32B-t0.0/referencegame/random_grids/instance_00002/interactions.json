Let me start by looking at the target grid and the distractors to find the key differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid is a 5x5 grid with a pattern of X's and □'s. Let me write it out to visualize better:\n\nTarget:\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nLooking at this, it seems like there's a checkerboard pattern. The X's are in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is odd. For example, (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), etc. So it's alternating X and □ in both rows and columns. This creates a consistent diagonal pattern.\n\nNow, let's look at Distractor 1:\n\nD1:\nRow 1: □ X X □ X\nRow 2: X □ X X □\nRow 3: □ X □ X X\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5",
