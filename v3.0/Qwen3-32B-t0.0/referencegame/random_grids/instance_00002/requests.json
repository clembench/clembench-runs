So, I need to create a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at the target grid and the distractors to find the key differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid is a 5x5 grid with a pattern of X's and □'s. Let me write it out to visualize better:\n\nTarget:\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nLooking at this, it seems like there's a checkerboard pattern. The X's are in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is odd. For example, (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (2,5), etc. So it's alternating X and □ in both rows and columns. This creates a consistent diagonal pattern.\n\nNow, let's look at Distractor 1:\n\nD1:\nRow 1: □ X X □ X\nRow 2: X □ X X □\nRow 3: □ X □ X X\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5",
