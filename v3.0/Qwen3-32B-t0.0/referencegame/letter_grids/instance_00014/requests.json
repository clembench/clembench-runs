Let me start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nThe target grid is a 5x5 grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X □ □ □ X\nRow 2: X □ □ □ X\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ □ □ X\n\nSo, the middle row (row 3) is all X's. The other rows have X's at the start and end, with empty cells in between. It looks like a cross shape, maybe? The vertical and horizontal lines meet in the middle.\n\nNow, the first distractor grid:\n\nRow 1: All X's\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: All X's\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: All X's\n\nThis one has a sort of checkerboard pattern in the even rows, with X's in the odd rows. So it's more dense with X's except for some gaps in rows 2 and 4.\n\nSecond distractor grid:\n\nRow 1: All X's\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □ (only first cell is X)\nRow",
