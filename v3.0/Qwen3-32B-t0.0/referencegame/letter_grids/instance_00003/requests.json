Let me start by analyzing each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Looking at it, the first row is all X's. Then rows 2, 3, and 4 have an X in the first column and then four □s. The fifth row is all X's again. So the pattern is a vertical line of X's on the leftmost column, with the top and bottom rows fully filled. Wait, no, actually, rows 2-4 have X only in the first column. So the leftmost column is all X's (since row 1, column 1 is X, rows 2-4, column 1 is X, and row 5, column 1 is X). Then the top and bottom rows are all X's. But rows 2-4 have X only in the first column and the rest empty. So the target grid looks like a vertical line on the left and a horizontal line on the top and bottom. But maybe it's better to think of it as a frame on the left and top/bottom?\n\nNow, Distractor 1: The first row is all X's. Then row 2 has X followed by four □s. Row 3 is all X's again. Row 4 is X followed by four □s.",
