Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: All X's. So five Xs in the first row.\nRow 2: Two □, then two Xs. Wait, the second row is □ □ □ X X. So three □ followed by two Xs.\nRow 3: □ □ X X □. So two □, then two Xs, then one □.\nRow 4: □ X X □ □. One □, two Xs, then two □.\nRow 5: All Xs again.\n\nNow, the distractor grids. Let's look at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: All Xs.\nRow 2: X □ X □ X. Alternating X and □ starting with X.\nRow 3: All Xs.\nRow 4: X □ X □ X. Same as row 2.\nRow 5: All Xs.\n\nSo Distractor 1 has a checkerboard pattern in rows 2 and 4. The target grid's second row is three □ followed by two Xs, which is different from Distractor 1's",
