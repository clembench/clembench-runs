The target is the first grid, and the other two are distractors. Let me look at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It has rows of Xs and □s. Let me write them out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ □ □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the pattern here seems like the first row is all Xs. Then the second row starts with an X followed by four □s. Third row all Xs again, fourth row same as second, and fifth all Xs. So it's like alternating rows of all Xs and rows with one X followed by four empty cells. But wait, rows 2 and 4 have the X in the first column and then four □s. So maybe it's a vertical pattern? Like columns? Let me check columns. Column 1 is all Xs. Columns 2-5 in even rows (rows 2 and 4) are all □s, but in odd rows (1,3,5) they are Xs. So the first column is all Xs,",
