Let me look at all three grids again.\n\nThe target grid has X's all around the edges. In the middle rows (rows 2 and 4), there are alternating X and □. Like, in row 2, it's X, □, X, □, X. Same for row 4. The other rows (1,3,5) are all X's. \n\nDistractor 1: Rows 2 and 4 have four □ in a row. So row 2 is X followed by four □, and row 4 is similar. The rest are X's. So the middle rows have a block of four □, unlike the target's alternating pattern.\n\nDistractor 2: It has three middle rows (rows 2,3,4) each with four □. So rows 2-4 all have X followed by four □. The target only has rows 2 and 4 with alternating, so the number of middle rows with □ is different here.\n\nSo the key differences are the pattern in the middle rows. The target alternates X and □ in rows 2 and 4, while the distractors have continuous □s. Also, Distractor 2 has three such rows instead of two. \n\nI need to mention that the",
