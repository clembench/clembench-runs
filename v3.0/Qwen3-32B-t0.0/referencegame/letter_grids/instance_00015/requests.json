So, I need to create a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractors. Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: All X's. So five Xs in the first row.\nRow 2: Two □, then two Xs. Wait, the second row is □ □ □ X X. So three □ followed by two Xs.\nRow 3: □ □ X X □. So two □, then two Xs, then one □.\nRow 4: □ X X □ □. One □, two Xs, then two □.\nRow 5: All Xs again.\n\nNow, the distractor grids. Let's look at Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: All Xs.\nRow 2: X □ X □ X. Alternating X and □ starting with X.\nRow 3: All Xs.\nRow 4: X □ X □ X. Same as row 2.\nRow 5: All Xs.\n\nSo Distractor 1 has a checkerboard pattern in rows 2 and 4. The target grid's second row is three □ followed by two Xs, which is different from Distractor 1's",
