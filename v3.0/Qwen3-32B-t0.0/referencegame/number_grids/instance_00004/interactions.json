Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X  \nRow 2: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 3: □ X X X X  \nRow 4: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 5: □ X X X X  \n\nNow, Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X  \nRow 2: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 3: □ X X X X  \nRow 4: □ □ □ □ □  \nRow 5: □ X X X X  \n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X  \nRow 2: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 3: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 4: □ X □ □ X  \nRow 5: □ X X X X  \n\nLooking at the target grid, the first thing I notice is the pattern in the columns.
