Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid's main difference must be in rows that are different from the distractors.
