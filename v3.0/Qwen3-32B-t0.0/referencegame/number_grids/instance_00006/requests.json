Let me start by looking at the target grid.\n\nThe target grid has the first row all filled with X's. Then, the next four rows have four empty cells (▢) in the first four columns and an X in the fifth column. So, the first row is all Xs, and the rest of the rows have X only in the last column.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor 1. Its first row starts with a ▢ followed by four Xs. Then, in the second to fifth rows, there's an X in the second column, then some ▢s and an X in the fifth. The pattern here is a vertical line of Xs in column 2 from row 2 to 5, plus some other Xs in the first row and others. \n\nDistractor 2 is similar but in row 3, column 2 to 4 are Xs. So, in row 3, there's a horizontal line of Xs from column 2 to 4. The other rows have similar patterns to Distractor 1 but with that difference in row 3.\n\nSo, the target grid's unique feature is the first row all Xs. Both distractors have ▢ in the first cell of the first row. Also, in the target, after the first row, only",
