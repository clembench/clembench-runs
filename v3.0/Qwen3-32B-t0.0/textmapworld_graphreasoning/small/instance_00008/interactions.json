In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

The goal is to visit every room and then stop when done.\n\nFirst, I should start by choosing a direction. Let's say I pick east first. So the Closet is the starting node. The graph will have Closet as a node. The edges for east will be from Closet to the next room. But I don't know what's east yet. Wait, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new node and the edge. So when I go east from Closet, the next room is added to the nodes, and the edge is added in the east direction.\n\nBut how do I know if there are more rooms? I need to traverse in a way that covers all possible directions. Maybe a depth-first search approach? Like, always go in one direction until you can't, then backtrack. But since the user is making decisions step by step, I need to track which directions have been explored.\n\nWait, the graph is being built as we go. Each time we move, we add the new node and the edge. So for the first move, Closet is the only node. When moving east, the new room is added, and the edge is Closet to that room in the east direction. Then, in the next step, the available directions in the new room",
