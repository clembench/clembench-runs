In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Kitchen, and the available directions are north and south. The example given starts in the Living Room, so maybe the initial graph is just the Kitchen here.\n\nFirst, I should decide which direction to go. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, I probably need to explore as much as possible in one direction before backtracking. But how do I know which direction leads to unvisited rooms? Since I don't have prior info, I'll have to choose one and then adjust as I go.\n\nLet's start by going north. The graph should include the Kitchen as a node. The edges for north, south, east, west will be updated based on movement. When I move north, the next room will be added to the nodes, and the edge from Kitchen to that room in the north direction will be recorded.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving west from the Living Room to the Library, the west edge in the graph gets a tuple (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So each edge direction (north, south, etc.) lists the pairs of rooms connected by that direction.\n\nSo, if I go north from the Kitchen, the next room (let's say it's the Dining Room) will be added to the nodes. Then, the north edge will have (\"Kitchen\", \"Dining Room\"), and the south edge",
