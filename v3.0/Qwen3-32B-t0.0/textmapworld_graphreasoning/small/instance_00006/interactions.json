In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\": \"DONE\", \"graph\": {...}}\nLet us start.\nYou are in the Media room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?",

The graph should have the Media room as a node, and the edges for east will be empty until I move. Wait, no, when I move east, the Media room will have an east connection to the next room. But since I haven't moved yet, the initial graph just has the Media room with no edges except maybe the direction I'm going to take. Hmm, the example shows that when you first start, the graph has the initial node and the edges are all empty. So in the first step, the graph is just the Media room with all directions as empty lists. Then, when I go east, the next room is added, and the edge from Media room to that room in the east direction is recorded. So my first action is to go east. The graph will have Media room as a node, and the east edge will be empty until I move. Wait, no, the example shows that when you go west from the Living Room to the Library, the west edge in the graph gets the tuple (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So when I go east from Media room, the east edge will have (\"Media room\", \"next_room\"). But I don't know the name of the next room yet. Wait, but in the example, after moving west, the graph's west edge has the connection. So",
