In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's start. I'm in the Home theater, and the only direction available is west. So I need to go west first. The graph should have the Home theater as a node, and the west edge should be empty since I haven't moved yet. Wait, no, when I go west, the edge will be added. Wait, in the example, when they first moved west from the Living Room to the Library, the west edge in the graph had (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So when I go west from Home theater, the west edge should have the connection between Home theater and the next room. But since I haven't moved yet, the initial graph only has Home theater as a node, and the edges are all empty. Then, after moving west, the next room is added to the nodes, and the west edge gets the connection.\n\nSo the first action is to go west. The graph initially has Home theater as a node, and edges are all empty. After moving west, the new room is added, and the west edge of the previous room (Home theater) will have the connection to the new room. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the west edge in the graph was [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the direction is the key in the edges, and the value is a list of tuples. So when moving west, the west edge in the graph should have the tuple (Home",
