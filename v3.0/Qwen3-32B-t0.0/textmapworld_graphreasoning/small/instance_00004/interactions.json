In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\": \"DONE\", \"graph\": {...}}\nLet us start.\nYou are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: west.

The graph should have the Guest room as a node, and the west edge should be empty since there's no connection yet. Wait, no, when I go west, the Guest room will have a west edge pointing to the next room. But since I haven't moved yet, the initial graph just has the Guest room with west as an empty list. Hmm, maybe the example shows that when you first start, the graph has the current node and edges as empty. So the first action is to go west. Then, after moving, the graph will update the west edge from Guest room to the new room. Let me make sure I follow the example correctly.\n\nIn the example, when they first enter the Living Room, the graph has the node as [\"Living Room\"], and the west edge is empty. Then when they go west to the Library, the graph adds the Library to the nodes and adds the west edge as (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So for my case, the first step is to go west. The graph initially has Guest room as a node, and all edges empty. Then after moving west, the Guest room's west edge will point to the new room. So the first action is GO: west. The graph should have nodes [\"Guest room\"] and edges with west as empty. Wait, but when I move",
