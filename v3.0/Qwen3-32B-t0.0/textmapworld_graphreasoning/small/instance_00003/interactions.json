In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east.

The example shows that each time you move, you add the new room to the graph and update the edges. Since the initial direction is east, I should go east first. The graph starts with just the Bedroom, and then when moving east, the new room (let's say it's the Living Room) is added. The edges would then show that Bedroom is connected east to Living Room. But wait, the example had the edges as tuples of the rooms. So when moving from Bedroom east to Living Room, the edge would be (\"Bedroom\", \"Living Room\") in the east list.\n\nNow, after moving east, the next step would depend on the available directions in the new room. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's directions yet, I can't plan further. The key is to always choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms to minimize backtracking. But since I don't know the map, I have to make decisions based on the current available directions. The first move is straightforward: go east. Then, in the next room, check the directions and pick one that hasn't been explored yet. The graph needs to be updated each time with the new node and the corresponding edge. Once all rooms are connected and there are no unvisited rooms, then output \"",
