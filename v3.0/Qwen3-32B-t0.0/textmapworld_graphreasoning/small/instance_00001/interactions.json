In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

The goal is to visit every room and then stop when done.\n\nFirst, I should start by choosing a direction. Let's say north. The Closet is the starting node. When I move north, I'll enter a new room. Let's call that room the Hallway. Now, the graph has Closet and Hallway connected by a north edge. The available directions from Hallway might be different. Suppose from Hallway, I can go east or south. If I go east, that's another room, maybe the Living Room. Then, from Living Room, directions could be south or west. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. \n\nWait, the key is to minimize room changes. So maybe a depth-first search approach would work here. Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. Let's try that. Starting in Closet, go north to Hallway. Then from Hallway, go east to Living Room. From Living Room, maybe go south to the Kitchen. Then from Kitchen, if there's a direction not yet explored, like west, but if that's already connected, then maybe backtrack. Each time, I need to update the graph with the new nodes and edges.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all rooms are connected.",
