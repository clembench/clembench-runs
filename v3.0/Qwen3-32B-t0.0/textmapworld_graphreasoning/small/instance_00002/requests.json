In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's start. I'm in the Pantry, and the only direction available is north. So I need to go north first. The graph should have the Pantry as a node and no edges yet since I haven't moved. Wait, when I go north, I'll enter a new room. Let me make sure to add that to the nodes and update the edges. The edges for north should have a connection from Pantry to the new room. But I need to track each direction's connections properly. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst action: GO: north. The graph will have Pantry as a node. The edges for north will be empty until I move. Wait, no. When I move north from Pantry, the new room will be connected via the north direction. So the edge should be from Pantry to the new room in the north direction. But how to represent that? The edges are stored as lists of tuples. So when I go north, the north list should have (\"Pantry\", \"New Room\"). But I don't know the name of the new room yet. Wait, the example shows that when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge is (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So when I move north from Pantry, the new room's name will be whatever it is, and the edge will be (\"Pantry\", \"New Room Name\"). But since I don't know the name yet, maybe",
