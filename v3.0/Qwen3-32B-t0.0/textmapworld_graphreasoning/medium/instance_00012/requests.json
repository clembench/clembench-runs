In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best direction to go from the Billiard room to minimize the number of room changes while visiting all rooms. The available directions are south, west, and east. The example given uses a graph to track nodes and edges, so I should start building that.\n\nFirst, the initial graph has the Billiard room as a node with no edges yet. The directions from here are south, west, east. To minimize room changes, I should choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. Since all directions are unexplored, maybe pick one arbitrarily. Let's go west first. That would add a new node and an edge from Billiard to the next room. But wait, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with the new node and the corresponding edge. So if I go west, the next room's node is added, and the west edge from Billiard to that room is recorded.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I don't get stuck in a loop. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. Let's try going west first. Then, from the new room, check available directions. If there are new directions, continue; otherwise, backtrack. But since I don't know the actual map, I have to simulate based on the responses.\n\nWait, the user is providing the available directions after each move. So each time",
