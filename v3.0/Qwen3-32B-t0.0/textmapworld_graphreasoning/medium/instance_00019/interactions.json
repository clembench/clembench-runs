In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

The example shows that the first move was to go west, so maybe I should follow a similar approach here. Let's start by choosing one direction, say west, to explore first.\n\nWhen I move west, I'll enter a new room. Let's call it Room A. Then, from there, I need to check the available directions. If there are new rooms, I should continue moving in a direction that hasn't been explored yet. But I also need to keep track of the graph to make sure I don't revisit rooms unnecessarily. \n\nWait, the graph needs to be updated each time. The nodes list should include all the rooms visited so far, and the edges should show the connections. For example, if I go from Nursery west to Room A, then the west edge in the graph would have a tuple (Nursery, Room A). \n\nI should use a depth-first search approach to minimize the number of backtracks. So, after moving west, if there's a new direction available, I'll keep going in that direction. If I hit a dead end, I'll backtrack by going back the way I came. But since the user can only move in available directions, I need to make sure that each move is to an unvisited room if possible. \n\nBut",
