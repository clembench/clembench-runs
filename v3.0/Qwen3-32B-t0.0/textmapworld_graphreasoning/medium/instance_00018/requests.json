In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's start. I'm in the Sauna, and the only direction available is east. So I need to go east first. The graph should have the Sauna as a node and no edges yet since I haven't moved. Wait, when I move east, the Sauna will connect to the next room. Let me make sure to update the graph each time.\n\nAfter moving east, I enter a new room. Let's say that's the first step. Now, the graph has Sauna and the new room. The edge between them would be east from Sauna to the new room, and west from the new room back to Sauna. But the example shows that edges are stored as tuples in the direction they were taken. So when I go east from Sauna, the edge is added to the east list as (Sauna, new_room). Then, when I go back west, the edge would be in the west list of the previous room. Wait, the example shows that when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge is (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So the direction is the direction taken from the current node. So each time I move, I add the edge in the direction I took from the previous room to the current one.\n\nSo for the first move, going east from Sauna to the next room (let's call it Room A), the graph's east edges would have (\"Sauna\", \"Room A\").
