In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north.

Currently available directions: south, east.

The example shows that the graph is built as they move, adding nodes and edges. The goal is to minimize room changes, so maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking.\n\nFirst, I should start by choosing a direction. Let's say I pick west first. The initial graph has the Wine cellar as a node. When moving west, the next room is added to the nodes, and an edge is created between Wine cellar and the new room in the west direction. Then, from the new room, check available directions again. If there's a new direction to explore, go that way. If not, backtrack. But how do I know when all rooms are covered?\n\nWait, the user needs to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So each time a new room is entered, it's added to the graph. The algorithm should keep track of all nodes and their connections. If all nodes have been visited and all edges are accounted for, then we can stop. But since the user is making decisions step by step, maybe the approach is to always go in a direction that hasn't been explored yet, using a stack or something to backtrack when necessary.\n\nIn the first step, from Wine cellar, directions are west",
