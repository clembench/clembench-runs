In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

I need to explore all rooms with the fewest changes. First, I'll choose one direction, maybe west. So I'll go west to the next room. Now, the graph has Closet and the new room. I need to update the edges. The west direction from Closet leads to the new room. Then, in the new room, check available directions. Suppose I go to the Hall. Now, from Hall, if there are directions like north, east, etc., I need to decide which to take next. But I have to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Maybe use a depth-first approach, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. If I reach a room with no unvisited directions, I backtrack. Once all rooms are visited, I can stop. Let me track the nodes and edges as I go. Each time I move, I add the new node and update the edges. When there are no more unvisited nodes, I output DONE.\n</think>\n\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Closet\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}<|im_end|>",
