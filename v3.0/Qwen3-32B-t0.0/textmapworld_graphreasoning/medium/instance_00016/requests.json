In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Since there's no other direction, I should go south first. The graph should have the Laundry room as a node and no edges yet because I haven't moved yet. Wait, but when I go south, I'll enter a new room. So the initial graph is just the Laundry room with empty edges. Then, after moving south, I need to add the new room to the nodes and update the edges. Let me make sure I follow the example correctly. The first step is to go south, and the graph will have the Laundry room as the only node. The edges for south will be empty until I move. Once I move, the next step will add the new room and the connection. So the first action is GO: south with the initial graph.\n</think>\n\n{\"action\":\"GO: south\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Laundry room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}<|im_end|>",
