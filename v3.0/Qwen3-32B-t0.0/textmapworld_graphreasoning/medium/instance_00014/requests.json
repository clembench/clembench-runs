In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Utility room and can go south or east. The example shows that each time you move, you add the new room to the graph and update the edges. The goal is to minimize the number of moves, so I should probably use a depth-first search approach, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking.\n\nStarting in the Utility room. Available directions: south and east. Let's pick one direction first. Maybe east first. So the first action is GO: east. The graph will have Utility as a node, and the east edge from Utility to the next room. But since we haven't moved yet, the edges would be empty except for the direction we took. Wait, in the example, when they went west from Living Room to Library, the west edge had (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So each edge direction is a list of tuples indicating which rooms are connected in that direction.\n\nSo when moving east from Utility, the next room is added to the nodes, and the east edge of Utility points to that room. Then, when in the next room, we check available directions again. Let's say the next room is, say, a Hall. Then from Hall, if there are directions like north, south, etc., we need to continue exploring. But since the user hasn't provided the actual rooms,",
