In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

So I need to go north first. The graph should have the Dining room as a node and no edges yet since I haven't moved. Then, when I go north, I'll enter a new room. Let's say that's the next step. I'll update the graph by adding the new room and the edge from Dining room to it in the north direction. I need to keep track of all the rooms I visit and the connections between them. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest changes, so maybe a depth-first search approach? But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Also, once all rooms are connected in the graph with no unvisited directions left, I can stop. Let me proceed step by step.\n</think>\n\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Dining room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}<|im_end|>",
