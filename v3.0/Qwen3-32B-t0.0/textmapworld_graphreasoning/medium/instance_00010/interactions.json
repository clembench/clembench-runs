In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north.

The example shows that each time you move, you add the new room to the graph and update the edges. The goal is to minimize the number of times you change direction, so maybe a depth-first search approach would work here. Let me start by choosing one direction first, say north. So the first move is north. The graph will have Media room and the next room. Then, from there, I need to check available directions again. But since I don't know what's next, I have to keep track of the nodes and edges as I go. If I hit a dead end, I backtrack. But since the user is providing the available directions each time, I can make decisions based on that. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nFirst step: GO north from Media room. The graph now has Media room and the new room. Let's call the new room Room A. The edge between Media and Room A is north. Now, in Room A, check available directions. Suppose the next available directions are, say, east and south. Then I would go east next, adding that room, and so on. But since the user is giving the available directions each time, I need to make sure that each move is recorded in the graph. The key is to always",
