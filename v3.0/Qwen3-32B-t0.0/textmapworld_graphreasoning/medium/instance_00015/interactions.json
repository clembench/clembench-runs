In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

Since the goal is to minimize room changes, I should explore one direction at a time, maybe depth-first. Let's pick south first. \n\nSo, moving south from Sauna. The graph now has Sauna as a node. The edges for south would be from Sauna to the next room. But I don't know the name of the next room yet. Wait, the example shows that when you move, the new room's name is given. But in the initial step, the user hasn't provided the next room's name yet. Hmm, maybe the graph is built incrementally as each move is made. So, the first move is to go south, and then the next input will tell me the name of the room I entered. \n\nWait, the example shows that after moving west from the Living Room, the next room is the Library. So, each time I move, the system tells me the new room's name and the available directions. So, the graph is built step by step. So, in the first step, I need to choose a direction (south or east) and then the system will tell me the next room. Then, I can update the graph accordingly.\n\nSo, the initial graph has only the Sauna node. When I move south, the next room is added to the",
