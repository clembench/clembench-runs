In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, let's start. I'm in the Cellar, and the only direction available is east. So I need to go east first. The graph should have the Cellar as a node and no edges yet since I haven't moved. Wait, when I move east, the Cellar will have an east edge to the next room. But I need to record that in the graph. Let me make sure I track each step properly.\n\nAfter moving east, I'll be in a new room. Let's say that's the Hall. Now, the available directions there might be different. I need to keep going in a direction that hasn't been explored yet to minimize room changes. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. But I have to remember to update the graph each time, adding nodes and edges based on the movement. If I ever reach a room where all directions have been explored and there are still unvisited nodes, I need to backtrack. But how do I know when all rooms are visited? The graph's nodes list will include all rooms once done. So when all nodes are in the graph and all edges are mapped, and there's no unvisited rooms left, then I can say DONE. Let me proceed step by step, making sure each move is recorded correctly in the graph.\n</think>\n\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Cellar\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[",
