In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\": \"DONE\", \"graph\": {...}}\nLet us start.\nYou are in the Nursery. Currently available directions: south.

The graph should have the Nursery as a node and the south edge as empty since we haven't explored that yet. Wait, but when I move south, the next room will be connected. So the initial graph should have the Nursery node and the south edge in the edges list. But since I haven't moved yet, maybe the edges are still empty. Hmm, the example shows that when you first start, the graph has the current node and the edges are empty. So in the first step, the graph is just the Nursery with all edges empty. Then, when I go south, the next room is added, and the edge from Nursery to that room is recorded in the south direction. So I need to make sure that each time I move, I update the graph with the new node and the corresponding edge.\n\nSo first action is GO: south. The graph has nodes [\"Nursery\"] and edges with south as an empty list. Then, after moving south, the new room is added, say it's the Living Room. Then the graph's nodes are [\"Nursery\", \"Living Room\"], and the edges for south would have (\"Nursery\", \"Living Room\"). But I need to check the directions available in each step. Wait, the user will provide the next room's available directions after each move. So I",
