	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to explore all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Pantry and can go north or south. The goal is to visit every room and then stop when done.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should start by choosing a direction. Let's say I go north first. The graph will have the Pantry as a node. The edges for north, south, east, west will be tracked. When I move north, the next room will be added to the nodes. Then, I need to check the available directions there. But I have to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I need to keep track of visited rooms to avoid cycles. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention knowing which rooms have been visited, only the directions available. Hmm, maybe the graph is being built as we go, so each time we move, we add the new room and the connection. So when I go north from Pantry, the edge between Pantry and the next room (let's call it Room A) is added to the north array. Then, in Room A, I check the available directions. If there are new directions, I proceed. But how do I know if all rooms are covered? The graph's nodes should list all the rooms once we've visited them. So when
