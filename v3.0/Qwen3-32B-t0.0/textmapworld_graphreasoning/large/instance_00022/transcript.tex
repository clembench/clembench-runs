	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Recreation room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's start. I'm in the Recreation room, and the only direction available is east. So I need to go east first. The graph should have the Recreation room as a node, and the edges for east will be empty until I move. Wait, no, when I move east, the edge from Recreation room to the next room will be added. But initially, the graph has only the Recreation room node and no edges. So the first action is to go east. Then, when I enter the next room, I'll update the graph with that new node and the edge from Recreation room to it. But the user wants the graph to be built as I go. So each time I move, I add the new node and the corresponding edge. The challenge is to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. But I need to keep track of visited rooms and the directions taken. Let me think step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt First step: Go east from Recreation room. The graph now has Recreation room and the new room. The edge east will have the connection between them. Then, in the new room, check available directions. Suppose I go east again if possible, otherwise try other directions. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Also, when all directions from a room have been explored and all connected rooms are visited, then backtrack. But how to
