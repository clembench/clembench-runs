	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Bedroom and can go west or east. The example shows that the graph is built as they move, so I need to track the nodes and edges.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the initial position is the Bedroom. The available directions are west and east. Since the graph is empty at the start, I should move in one direction to explore. Let's choose west first. But wait, the example starts by moving west from the Living Room. Maybe the same approach here. But I need to make sure that each move adds to the graph correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt When I move west from the Bedroom, the next room will be added to the nodes. Then, the edges will be updated. The direction I took (west) would create an edge from Bedroom to the new room. But the graph's edges are stored as tuples in the respective directions. For example, if moving west from Bedroom to another room, the west edge would have ("Bedroom", "New Room"), and the east edge of the new room would have ("New Room", "Bedroom") because going back east would return to the Bedroom.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example shows that when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge has ("Living Room", "Library"), and the east edge of the Library would have the reverse. So each direction's list in edges contains the pairs in the order
