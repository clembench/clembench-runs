	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's start. I'm in the Media room, and the only direction available is north. So I need to go north first. The graph should have the Media room as a node and no edges yet since I haven't moved. Wait, when I go north, the next room will be connected from Media room's north. So the graph's edges for north should have ("Media room", next_room) once I move. But since I haven't moved yet, the initial graph just has the Media room node and empty edges. So the first action is to go north. Let me make sure I'm following the example correctly. The example starts with the Living Room, then goes west to Library, then north to Kitchen. Each time, the graph is updated with the new nodes and edges. So here, first step is GO: north. The graph will have nodes ["Media room"] and edges all empty except maybe after moving. Wait, no, before moving, the graph is just the current node. So the initial action is to go north. The graph at that step is only the Media room node with all edges empty. Then, after moving north, the next room is added, and the edge is updated. So the first response should be {"action":"GO: north", "graph": {"nodes":["Media room"], "edges":{"north":[], "south":[], "east":[], "west":[]}}}.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt {"action":"GO: north
