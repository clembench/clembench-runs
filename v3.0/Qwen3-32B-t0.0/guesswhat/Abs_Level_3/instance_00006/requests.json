I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: technician, optician, psychotherapist, chiropractor, surgeon, gp, nurse, pharmacist.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common traits. Maybe start by dividing them into medical vs. non-medical? But all of them are medical professions except maybe technician? Wait, technician is a bit broad. But in the list, the others are all specific medical roles. So maybe the first question is whether the job requires a medical degree. If I ask that, the answer would be yes for surgeon, gp, nurse, pharmacist, maybe psychotherapist? Wait, psychotherapists might need a degree but not necessarily a medical one. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if the person is a doctor. But \"gp\" is a general practitioner, which is a doctor. Surgeon is a doctor. Nurse is not a doctor. Pharmacist is a different role. Optician, chiropractor, psychotherapist, technician—some might have different qualifications. \n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if the job involves performing surgery. Surgeon would be yes. Others like chiropractor might not. But that's a specific question. Maybe start with broader categories. Let's think: the list includes roles that are more specialized. For example, \"gp\" is a general practitioner, which is a doctor. Nurse is a nurse. Pharmacist is",
