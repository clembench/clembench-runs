	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['technician', 'optician', 'psychotherapist', 'chiropractor', 'surgeon', 'gp', 'nurse', 'pharmacist']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: technician, optician, psychotherapist, chiropractor, surgeon, gp, nurse, pharmacist.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for categories or common traits. Maybe start by dividing them into medical vs. non-medical? But all of them are medical professions except maybe technician? Wait, technician is a bit broad. But in the list, the others are all specific medical roles. So maybe the first question is whether the job requires a medical degree. If I ask that, the answer would be yes for surgeon, gp, nurse, pharmacist, maybe psychotherapist? Wait, psychotherapists might need a degree but not necessarily a medical one. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if the person is a doctor. But "gp" is a general practitioner, which is a doctor. Surgeon is a doctor. Nurse is not a doctor. Pharmacist is a different role. Optician, chiropractor, psychotherapist, technician—some might have different qualifications. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe ask if the job involves performing surgery. Surgeon would be yes. Others like chiropractor might not. But that's a specific question. Maybe start with broader categories. Let's think: the list includes roles that are more specialized. For example, "gp" is a general practitioner, which is a doctor. Nurse is a nurse. Pharmacist is
