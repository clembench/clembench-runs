The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['cholera', 'herpes', 'smallpox', 'chickenpox', 'chlamydia', 'gonorrhoea', 'depression', 'anxiety']",

The list includes cholera, herpes, smallpox, chickenpox, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, depression, and anxiety. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories that can split the list. Maybe start by determining if it's a physical illness or a mental health condition. That could split the list into two groups. Let's check: depression and anxiety are mental, the rest are physical. So if I ask if it's a mental health condition, and the answer is yes, then it's either depression or anxiety. If no, then it's one of the others.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or specific characteristics. So maybe I can't ask about the type of condition directly. Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe ask if it's a viral infection. Let's see: cholera is bacterial, herpes is viral, smallpox is viral, chickenpox is viral, chlamydia and gonorrhoea are bacterial, depression and anxiety are not infections. So if I ask if it's a viral infection, the answer could narrow it down. If yes, then possible options are herpes, smallpox, chickenpox. If no, then maybe bacterial (cholera, chlamydia, gonorrhoea) or mental (depression",
