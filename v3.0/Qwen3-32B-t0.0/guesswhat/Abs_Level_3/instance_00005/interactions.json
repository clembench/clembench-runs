The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['midday', 'sunrise', 'suppertime', 'lunchtime', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'breakfast', 'brunch']",

The list has eight words: midday, sunrise, suppertime, lunchtime, afternoon, evening, breakfast, brunch. \n\nFirst, I should think about categories that can split the list. Maybe time of day? Let's see. The words are all related to times of the day. Let's categorize them:\n\n- Morning: sunrise, breakfast, brunch\n- Midday: midday, lunchtime\n- Afternoon: afternoon\n- Evening: evening, suppertime\n\nSo if I ask if the word is a morning time, that would split into three words. If the answer is yes, then I have three options left. If no, then the rest. But maybe a better split is possible. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a specific meal time. For example, breakfast, brunch, lunchtime, suppertime are meal-related. The others are more general times. So maybe ask if the word is associated with a meal. Let's see:\n\nMeal-related: breakfast, brunch, lunchtime, suppertime (4 words)\nNon-meal: midday, sunrise, afternoon, evening (4 words)\n\nThat splits the list in half. So the first question could be: Is the word associated with a meal? If yes, then four options left. If no, the other four. Let's try that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the",
