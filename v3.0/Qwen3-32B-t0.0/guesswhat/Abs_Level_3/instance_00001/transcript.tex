	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['gunner', 'officer', 'corporal', 'sergeant', 'captain', 'major', 'general', 'brigadier']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: gunner, officer, corporal, sergeant, captain, major, general, brigadier. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions and then make one guess. The questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, so I have to think about their meanings or categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these words. All of them are military ranks except maybe "gunner." Wait, "gunner" is a role, like a soldier who operates a gun, but is it a rank? Let me check. In some armies, a gunner might be a specialist role but not a rank. The others like corporal, sergeant, captain, etc., are all ranks. So maybe the first question is whether the word is a rank. If the answer is yes, then I can narrow it down among the ranks. If no, then it's "gunner."\\ \tt \\ \tt So first question: Is the target word a military rank? If yes, then the options are officer (which is a general term for someone with a rank), corporal, sergeant, captain, major, general, brigadier. Wait, "officer" is a category that includes all those ranks. So if the answer is yes, then I need to figure out which specific rank. If the answer is no, then it's "gunner."\\ \tt \\ \tt Assuming the answer
