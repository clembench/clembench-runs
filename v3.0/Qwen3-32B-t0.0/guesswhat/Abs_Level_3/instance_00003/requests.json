Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: oblong, semicircle, nonagon, heptagon, trapezium, parallelogram, dodecahedron, decahedron.\n\nFirst, I should categorize them. Some are 2D shapes, others 3D. For example, dodecahedron and decahedron are 3D (hedron usually means face, so polyhedrons). The rest are 2D. So maybe first question: Is the target a 3D shape? If yes, then it's either dodecahedron or decahedron. If no, then among the others.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a polygon or polyhedron. Hmm. So maybe think about properties. For example, does it have curved sides? Semicircle is a 2D shape with a curve. The others are polygons (straight sides). So maybe first question: Does the target have a curved side? If yes, it's semicircle. If no, then it's a polygon or another 3D shape.\n\nBut wait, trapezium and parallelogram are quadrilaterals. Oblong is a rectangle or ellipse? Wait, oblong can mean a rectangle that's",
