	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['baker', 'butcher', 'accountant', 'businessman', 'musician', 'dancer', 'hairdresser', 'plumber']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: baker, butcher, accountant, businessman, musician, dancer, hairdresser, plumber. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should try to categorize them. Maybe start by dividing them into groups. For example, some are professions related to specific trades, others might be more general. Let me think. Baker, butcher, hairdresser, plumber are all specific trades. Accountant and businessman are more office-based. Musician and dancer are in the arts. \\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe my first question could be about whether the job is a trade that works with physical objects or services. Like, "Is the job a trade that involves working with physical objects or providing a specific service?" If yes, that would include baker, butcher, hairdresser, plumber. If no, then accountant, businessman, musician, dancer. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe ask if the job is related to the arts. If yes, then musician or dancer. If no, the others. But that might split the list into two groups of two and six, which might not be as helpful. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: whether the job requires a college degree. Accountant and businessman might require more formal education, while the others might not. But not sure if that's a safe assumption. For example, a hairdresser might need a license but not a college degree. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about
