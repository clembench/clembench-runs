The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is troll, minotaur, psychic, witch, monster, unicorn, vampire, goblin. First, I should try to categorize these words to narrow down the options.\n\nHmm, some of these are mythical creatures, others might be more like magical beings. For example, troll, minotaur, monster, unicorn, vampire, goblin are all creatures. Psychic and witch are more about abilities or roles. So maybe my first question should be whether the word is a creature. Let me ask that.\n\nWait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking if it's a creature is okay. Let me try that. If the answer is yes, then I can eliminate psychic and witch. If no, then maybe it's one of those two. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a mythical or magical creature?<|im_end|>",
