Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is sledding, cycling, football, boxing, swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking. First, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list into halves.\n\nHmm, maybe start with whether the activity is typically done in water. That would separate swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking from the others. Let me check: yes, those four are water-based. So if I ask if the activity is done in water, and the answer is yes, then I have four options left. If no, then the remaining are sledding, cycling, football, boxing. That's a good first split.\n\nSo first question: Is the activity typically done in water? Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the activity typically done in water?<|im_end|>",
