The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list includes religions like Hinduism, Scientology, Taoism, Jainism, Christianity, Sikhism, Protestant, and Quaker. \n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics that can split the list into halves. Maybe start by checking if the religion is Abrahamic. Abrahamic religions include Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and their branches. Let's see which ones are in the list. Christianity and Protestant are there. Quaker is a branch of Christianity, so maybe that's included too. Sikhism is also considered an Abrahamic religion sometimes, but I'm not sure. Hinduism, Taoism, Jainism, and Scientology are non-Abrahamic. So if I ask if it's an Abrahamic religion, the answer could split the list. If yes, then possible options are Christianity, Protestant, Quaker, Sikhism. If no, then Hinduism, Scientology, Taoism, Jainism. That's four each. Hmm, maybe that's a good first question.\n\nWait, but Sikhism is a bit of a gray area. Let me confirm. Sikhism is considered a dharmic religion but sometimes grouped with Abrahamic. Maybe better to ask a different question. Alternatively, check if the religion is monotheistic. Christianity, Protestant, Quaker, Sikhism, and",
