Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target from the given list using as few yes/no questions as possible. The list includes units of measurement: ton, pound, microgram, milligram, millilitre, litre, tablespoon, teaspoon. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. Some are weight/mass units, others are volume. Ton and pound are larger weight units. Microgram and milligram are very small. Millilitre and litre are volume, and tablespoon/teaspoon are also volume but in cooking terms.\n\nMaybe start by asking if the unit is a measure of weight or mass. If the answer is yes, then narrow down between ton, pound, microgram, milligram. If no, then it's volume, so between millilitre, litre, tablespoon, teaspoon.\n\nSo first question: Is the target a unit of weight or mass? If yes, next question could be if it's a large unit (ton/pound) vs small (microgram/milligram). If no, then check if it's a liquid volume (litre/millilitre) or a cooking measure (tablespoon/teaspoon). \n\nBut I need to make sure each question splits the possibilities as evenly as possible. Let's see. The list has 8 words. If I split into weight vs volume, there are 4 weight (ton, pound, microgram, milligram) and 4",
