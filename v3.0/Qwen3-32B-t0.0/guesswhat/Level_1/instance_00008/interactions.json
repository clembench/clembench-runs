The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

First, I should try to categorize these words to narrow down.\n\nHmm, some are herbs (Cinnamon, Basil), some are nouns like Dog, Child, others are languages (Latin, Classical), and drinks (Coke, Lemonade). Maybe start by asking if it's a type of plant or herb. If the answer is yes, then between Cinnamon and Basil. If not, check if it's an animal (Dog), a person (Child), a language (Latin, Classical), or a drink (Coke, Lemonade). \n\nWait, the first question should split the list as evenly as possible. Let's see. How about asking if it's a type of plant. That would include Cinnamon and Basil. If yes, then next question could be if it's a spice, which would narrow to Cinnamon. If not, maybe Basil. If the answer is no, then the remaining words are Dog, Child, Latin, Classical, Coke, Lemonade. Then maybe ask if it's a beverage. That would include Coke and Lemonade. If yes, then next question could be if it's carbonated (Coke). If no, Lemonade. If the first answer is no and the second is no, then check if",
