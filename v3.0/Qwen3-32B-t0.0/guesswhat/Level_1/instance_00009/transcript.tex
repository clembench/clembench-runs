	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Running', 'Track', 'Cornerback', 'Coach', 'Scarf', 'Gloves', 'Heirlooms', 'Clothes']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is ['Running', 'Track', 'Cornerback', 'Coach', 'Scarf', 'Gloves', 'Heirlooms', 'Clothes']. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should try to categorize the words. Let me group them. 'Running' and 'Track' might be related to sports or activities. 'Cornerback' is definitely a sports term, specifically American football. 'Coach' could be a person in sports or someone who teaches. 'Scarf', 'Gloves', and 'Clothes' are all clothing items. 'Heirlooms' are family heirlooms, like valuable items passed down.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe start by splitting the list into categories. Let's see if the target is a clothing item. If I ask, "Is the word a type of clothing?" then the answer would be yes for Scarf, Gloves, Clothes. If no, then the others. That could split the list into two groups. Let's try that first question.\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then I have three options. If no, then the remaining five. But since the maximum questions allowed are 7, maybe starting with a broader category is better. Alternatively, maybe check if it's related to sports. Let's see: Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach. So four words. If I ask if it's
