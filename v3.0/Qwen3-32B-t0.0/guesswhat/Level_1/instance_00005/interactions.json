The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Topaz', 'Sapphire', 'Blouse', 'Glasses', 'Tuba', 'Alarm', 'Burglary', 'Rape']",

The list has eight words: Topaz, Sapphire, Blouse, Glasses, Tuba, Alarm, Burglary, Rape. The challenge is to narrow it down with as few questions as possible, up to seven, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list. Let me categorize the words. Topaz and Sapphire are gemstones. Blouse and Glasses are clothing/accessories. Tuba is a musical instrument. Alarm is a device or a state. Burglary and Rape are crimes. So maybe start by asking if the word is a gemstone. If yes, then between Topaz and Sapphire. If no, move to other categories.\n\nBut wait, the user said questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a 5-letter word or anything like that. So the first question could be: Is the word a type of gemstone? If yes, then next question to distinguish between Topaz and Sapphire. Maybe ask if it's a color? Topaz can be various colors, but Sapphire is typically blue. But that's getting into specific characteristics. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, think of another attribute. Maybe if it's a color, but Sapphire is a color (blue) and Topaz isn't. Wait, but Sapphire",
