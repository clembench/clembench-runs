I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Topaz, Sapphire, Blouse, Glasses, Tuba, Alarm, Burglary, Rape. The challenge is to narrow it down with as few questions as possible, up to seven, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list. Let me categorize the words. Topaz and Sapphire are gemstones. Blouse and Glasses are clothing/accessories. Tuba is a musical instrument. Alarm is a device or a state. Burglary and Rape are crimes. So maybe start by asking if the word is a gemstone. If yes, then between Topaz and Sapphire. If no, move to other categories.\n\nBut wait, the user said questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a 5-letter word or anything like that. So the first question could be: Is the word a type of gemstone? If yes, then next question to distinguish between Topaz and Sapphire. Maybe ask if it's a color? Topaz can be various colors, but Sapphire is typically blue. But that's getting into specific characteristics. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, think of another attribute. Maybe if it's a color, but Sapphire is a color (blue) and Topaz isn't. Wait, but Sapphire",
