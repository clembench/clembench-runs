Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center']. \n\nFirst, I should try to categorize the words. Let me look for common themes. Some are colors (White, Silver), some are furniture (Hutch, Chair), clothing (Sweatshirt, Shoes), and others like Punter and Center. Punter and Center might be roles in sports, like American football or rugby. \n\nMaybe start by asking if the word is a color. If the answer is yes, then it's either White or Silver. If not, move to other categories. Let me try that first.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the word a color? That would split the list into two groups. If yes, then next question could be if it's White or Silver. If no, then check if it's a piece of furniture, clothing, or a role.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if it's a type of clothing. Sweatshirt and Shoes are clothing. If yes, then next question could be if it's a top or bottom, but the answer has to be yes/no. Maybe ask if it's a type of footwear? That would narrow down to Shoes. If not, then Sweatshirt.\n\nAnother angle: Punter and Center are positions in",
