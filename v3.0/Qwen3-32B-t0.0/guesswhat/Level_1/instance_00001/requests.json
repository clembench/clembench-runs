Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is ['Private', 'Cadet', 'Mesa', 'Rock', 'Legos', 'Train', 'Dinero', 'Dime']. First, I should try to categorize these words to narrow down the options.\n\nHmm, some of these are nouns, but that's too broad. Let's think about possible categories. Maybe whether the word is a person, place, thing, or concept. \"Private\" could be a rank in the military. \"Cadet\" is also a military or academic term. \"Mesa\" is a geographical feature. \"Rock\" could be a mineral or a genre of music. \"Legos\" are toys. \"Train\" is a vehicle or a verb. \"Dinero\" means money in Spanish. \"Dime\" is a coin or a slang term.\n\nFirst question: Is the target word related to a person or a role? If I ask that, \"Private\" and \"Cadet\" would be yes. Others like \"Mesa\" (place), \"Rock\" (object), \"Legos\" (toy), \"Train\" (vehicle), \"Dinero\" (money), \"Dime\" (coin) would be no. If the answer is yes, then it's between \"Private\" and \"Cadet\". If no, then the next step.\n\nAlternatively,",
