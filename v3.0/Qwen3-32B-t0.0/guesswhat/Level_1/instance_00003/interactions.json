The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage']",

The list is ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage']. First, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list into halves.\n\nLooking at the words, some are nouns, but that's too broad. Maybe categorize by type. For example, are they vehicles? 'Semi' and 'Sled' could be vehicles. 'Mailman' is a person, 'Scientist' is a person. 'Clover' and 'Broccoli' are plants. 'Foyer' and 'Garage' are parts of a house. So maybe start by asking if it's a type of vehicle. If yes, then between 'Semi' and 'Sled'. If not, move to other categories.\n\nBut wait, 'Semi' is a type of truck, 'Sled' is a vehicle for snow. So first question: Is the target a type of vehicle? If yes, then next question to distinguish between 'Semi' and 'Sled' could be something like \"Is it used for transportation on snow?\" If yes, it's 'Sled'; if no, 'Semi'.\n\nIf the first answer is no, then check if it's a person.
