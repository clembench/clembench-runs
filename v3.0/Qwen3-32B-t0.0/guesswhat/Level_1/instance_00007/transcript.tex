	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Chrysanthemum', 'Dandelion', 'Sturgeon', 'Trout', 'Seeds', 'Edger', 'Rosemary', 'Chives']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Sturgeon, Trout, Seeds, Edger, Rosemary, Chives.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize them. Let me group them. Chrysanthemum and Dandelion are flowers. Sturgeon and Trout are fish. Seeds are... well, seeds. Edger is a tool, maybe for trimming. Rosemary and Chives are herbs. So maybe start by asking if it's a plant. But wait, some plants are flowers, herbs, etc. Let me think. If I ask if it's a type of plant, that would include Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Rosemary, Chives, and Seeds. But Seeds might not be a plant itself. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a flower. That would narrow it to Chrysanthemum and Dandelion. But if the answer is no, then I have to consider other categories. Alternatively, ask if it's a fish. That would be Sturgeon or Trout. If the answer is yes, then I can ask which one. But maybe there's a better way. Let's see. Another approach: maybe ask if it's a type of herb. That would be Rosemary and Chives. If yes, then maybe ask another question to distinguish. If
