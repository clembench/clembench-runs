Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Sturgeon, Trout, Seeds, Edger, Rosemary, Chives.\n\nFirst, I should categorize them. Let me group them. Chrysanthemum and Dandelion are flowers. Sturgeon and Trout are fish. Seeds are... well, seeds. Edger is a tool, maybe for trimming. Rosemary and Chives are herbs. So maybe start by asking if it's a plant. But wait, some plants are flowers, herbs, etc. Let me think. If I ask if it's a type of plant, that would include Chrysanthemum, Dandelion, Rosemary, Chives, and Seeds. But Seeds might not be a plant itself. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a flower. That would narrow it to Chrysanthemum and Dandelion. But if the answer is no, then I have to consider other categories. Alternatively, ask if it's a fish. That would be Sturgeon or Trout. If the answer is yes, then I can ask which one. But maybe there's a better way. Let's see. Another approach: maybe ask if it's a type of herb. That would be Rosemary and Chives. If yes, then maybe ask another question to distinguish. If",
