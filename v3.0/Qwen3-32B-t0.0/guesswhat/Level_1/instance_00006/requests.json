Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is: Foot, Millimeter, Mamba, King, Tricycle, Dollhouse, Sauce, Garlic. \n\nFirst, I should try to categorize these words. Let's see. Some are body parts (Foot), units of measurement (Millimeter), animals (Mamba, King), vehicles (Tricycle), objects (Dollhouse), and food items (Sauce, Garlic). \n\nMaybe start by dividing them into categories. For example, is the target a unit of measurement? If I ask that, Millimeter would be yes, others no. But if the answer is no, then I eliminate one. But maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, think about size. Is the target something small? Millimeter is a small unit, Mamba is a snake, maybe small? Tricycle is a three-wheeler, which is bigger. Dollhouse is a small house. Garlic is a small bulb. \n\nAnother angle: living vs. non-living. Mamba is a living creature, others are not. So if I ask if it's a living thing, and the answer is yes, then it's Mamba. If no, then others. But King could be a person, but maybe the question is about the word's category. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So",
