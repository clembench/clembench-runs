I need to figure out the target word from the list: lunchtime, evening, fainting, swelling, paganism, wiccan, knight, sir. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, and then one guess. The questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, so I have to think about categories or attributes.\n\nFirst, maybe group the words by categories. Let's see: lunchtime and evening are times of day. Fainting and swelling are medical terms or conditions. Paganism and wiccan are religions or beliefs. Knight and sir are titles or roles, maybe related to chivalry. So maybe start by asking if the word is a time of day. If yes, then between lunchtime and evening. If no, check other categories.\n\nBut wait, the user might have a different grouping. Let me think again. Another approach: check if the word is a noun. All of them are nouns, so that's not helpful. Maybe check if it's a person-related term. Knight and sir are titles for people. Paganism and wiccan are beliefs. Fainting and swelling are conditions. Lunchtime and evening are times. So maybe ask if the word is related to a person or title. If yes, then knight or sir. If not, check other categories.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if the word is a religious term. Paganism and w",
