	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['lunchtime', 'evening', 'fainting', 'swelling', 'paganism', 'wiccan', 'knight', 'sir']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the target word from the list: lunchtime, evening, fainting, swelling, paganism, wiccan, knight, sir. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, and then one guess. The questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, so I have to think about categories or attributes.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, maybe group the words by categories. Let's see: lunchtime and evening are times of day. Fainting and swelling are medical terms or conditions. Paganism and wiccan are religions or beliefs. Knight and sir are titles or roles, maybe related to chivalry. So maybe start by asking if the word is a time of day. If yes, then between lunchtime and evening. If no, check other categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the user might have a different grouping. Let me think again. Another approach: check if the word is a noun. All of them are nouns, so that's not helpful. Maybe check if it's a person-related term. Knight and sir are titles for people. Paganism and wiccan are beliefs. Fainting and swelling are conditions. Lunchtime and evening are times. So maybe ask if the word is related to a person or title. If yes, then knight or sir. If not, check other categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe ask if the word is a religious term. Paganism and w
