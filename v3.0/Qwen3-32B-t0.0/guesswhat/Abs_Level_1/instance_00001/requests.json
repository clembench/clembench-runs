Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out the target word from the list: polygon, crescent, lawyer, magistrate, bowl, tube, relay, soccer. The user will answer yes or no to my questions, and I can ask up to 7 questions before guessing. My goal is to narrow it down as efficiently as possible.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. Let me list them again: polygon (geometry), crescent (shape or moon phase), lawyer (profession), magistrate (profession), bowl (object), tube (object), relay (event or transportation), soccer (sport). So there are professions, objects, sports, and a geometric term.\n\nMaybe start by splitting the list into categories. Let's see if the word is a profession. Lawyer and magistrate are professions. If I ask if it's a profession, and the answer is yes, then it's one of those two. If no, then it's the others. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, check if it's a sport. Soccer is a sport. Relay could be a sport event (like relay race) or part of a transportation system. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: check if the word is related to sports. If yes, then soccer or relay. If not, maybe check if it's a shape (polygon, crescent) or an object (bowl, tube). Let me think. Let's try to split the list into halves. There are ",
