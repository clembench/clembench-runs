The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: schizophrenia, sociopath, acquaintance, employee, parsec, pitch, lying, annoying. \n\nFirst, I should try to categorize them. Maybe start by grouping them into categories like mental health terms, job-related, social terms, units of measurement, etc. \n\nSchizophrenia and sociopath are both mental health conditions. Acquaintance and employee are social or job-related. Parsec is a unit of distance. Pitch could be a baseball term or a musical note. Lying and annoying are actions or adjectives.\n\nSo maybe my first question should be to split them into broad categories. Let's see. Are there any words that are mental health disorders? That would include schizophrenia and sociopath. If the answer is yes, then the target is one of those two. If no, then it's the others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if the word is a unit of measurement. Parsec is the only one. But that might be too narrow. \n\nAnother approach: Are there any words that describe a person's job or role? Employee and acquaintance. But maybe that's not the best first question. \n\nWait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a long word or has a certain letter. \n\nLet me think again. Let's try to",
