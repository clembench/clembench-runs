	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['schizophrenia', 'sociopath', 'acquaintance', 'employee', 'parsec', 'pitch', 'lying', 'annoying']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: schizophrenia, sociopath, acquaintance, employee, parsec, pitch, lying, annoying. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should try to categorize them. Maybe start by grouping them into categories like mental health terms, job-related, social terms, units of measurement, etc. \\ \tt \\ \tt Schizophrenia and sociopath are both mental health conditions. Acquaintance and employee are social or job-related. Parsec is a unit of distance. Pitch could be a baseball term or a musical note. Lying and annoying are actions or adjectives.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe my first question should be to split them into broad categories. Let's see. Are there any words that are mental health disorders? That would include schizophrenia and sociopath. If the answer is yes, then the target is one of those two. If no, then it's the others. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe ask if the word is a unit of measurement. Parsec is the only one. But that might be too narrow. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another approach: Are there any words that describe a person's job or role? Employee and acquaintance. But maybe that's not the best first question. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a long word or has a certain letter. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let me think again. Let's try to
