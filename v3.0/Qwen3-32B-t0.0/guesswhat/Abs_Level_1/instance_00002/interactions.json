The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['son', 'stepbrother', 'fever', 'sty', 'windsurfing', 'paragliding', 'optician', 'neurosurgeon']",

The list has eight words: son, stepbrother, fever, sty, windsurfing, paragliding, optician, neurosurgeon.\n\nFirst, I should categorize them to narrow down. Maybe start by checking if the word is a person or a thing. Let's see. Son and stepbrother are people. Fever and sty are medical terms. Windsurfing and paragliding are activities. Optician and neurosurgeon are professions. So maybe first question: Is the target a person? If yes, then it's either son, stepbrother, optician, or neurosurgeon. If not, then it's fever, sty, windsurfing, or paragliding.\n\nBut wait, the user said the question can't be about the structure or specific characteristics. So maybe I can't ask \"Is it a person?\" because that's a category. Hmm. Maybe rephrase. Let's think of another approach. Maybe ask if it's related to health. Fever and sty are health-related. So if the answer is yes, then it's one of those. If not, maybe the others. But I need to make sure the question is allowed. The rules say the question can't be about the structure or specific characteristics. So maybe \"Is the target a medical condition?\" That's allowed",
