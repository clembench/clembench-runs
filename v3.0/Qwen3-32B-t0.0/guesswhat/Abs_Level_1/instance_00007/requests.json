Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: outlier, datum, psychotic, greed, league, knot, one, twenty-nine. The goal is to narrow it down with as few questions as possible, up to seven, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list. Let's see. Maybe start with parts of speech. Are there nouns, adjectives, etc.? Let's check:\n\n- outlier: noun\n- datum: noun\n- psychotic: adjective\n- greed: noun\n- league: noun\n- knot: noun\n- one: number (can be noun or adjective)\n- twenty-nine: number\n\nSo, if I ask if the word is a number, that would split into two groups: one and twenty-nine. If the answer is yes, then I can ask if it's one or twenty-nine. But if the answer is no, then I have the other six words. But maybe starting with numbers is a good idea because there are two numbers. Let me try that first.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking if it's a number might be allowed, since it's about the meaning. Let me check the rules again. The questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So",
