The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['birthday', 'marriage', 'laud', 'afternoon', 'optometrist', 'podiatry', 'spot', 'sweating']",

The list has eight words: birthday, marriage, laud, afternoon, optometrist, podiatry, spot, sweating. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common themes. Let's categorize them. Birthday and marriage are events or occasions. Laud is a verb meaning to praise, but maybe it's also a noun? Afternoon is a time of day. Optometrist and podiatry are medical professions. Spot can be a noun (a place) or a verb (to see something). Sweating is a physical process.\n\nSo maybe start by splitting them into categories. Let's see if the target is a medical profession. If I ask, \"Is the word a medical profession?\" If yes, then it's either optometrist or podiatry. If no, then eliminate those. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, check if it's an event or occasion. Birthday and marriage are events. So if the answer is yes, then between those two. \n\nAnother angle: is the word a time of day? Afternoon is. If yes, then that's the one. If not, move on. Also, sweating is a physiological process. Maybe ask if it's a physical process. \n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. Laud is a verb, but maybe others can be verbs too. But the rules",
