Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: birthday, marriage, laud, afternoon, optometrist, podiatry, spot, sweating. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common themes. Let's categorize them. Birthday and marriage are events or occasions. Laud is a verb meaning to praise, but maybe it's also a noun? Afternoon is a time of day. Optometrist and podiatry are medical professions. Spot can be a noun (a place) or a verb (to see something). Sweating is a physical process.\n\nSo maybe start by splitting them into categories. Let's see if the target is a medical profession. If I ask, \"Is the word a medical profession?\" If yes, then it's either optometrist or podiatry. If no, then eliminate those. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, check if it's an event or occasion. Birthday and marriage are events. So if the answer is yes, then between those two. \n\nAnother angle: is the word a time of day? Afternoon is. If yes, then that's the one. If not, move on. Also, sweating is a physiological process. Maybe ask if it's a physical process. \n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. Laud is a verb, but maybe others can be verbs too. But the rules",
