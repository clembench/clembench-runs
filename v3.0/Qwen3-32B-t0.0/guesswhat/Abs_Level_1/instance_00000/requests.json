Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list is ['postman', 'actor', 'flatmate', 'bos', 'dietician', 'nurse', 'name', 'infinitive']. First, I should look for categories or common attributes that can split the list into halves.\n\nHmm, maybe start with whether the word is a profession. Let's check: postman, actor, dietician, nurse are professions. Flatmate is a person you live with, bos (probably a typo for boss?), name is a noun, infinitive is a grammar term. So if I ask if it's a profession, that would split into 4 yes and 4 no. But wait, 'bos' might be a typo for 'boss', which is a profession. So maybe 5 yes? Wait, the list has 'bos' as is. If the user meant 'boss', then it's a profession. But if it's 'bos' as in a Dutch word or abbreviation, maybe not. But I have to go with the given words. So maybe the question is whether it's a profession. Let's see:\n\nIf the answer is yes, then possible words are postman, actor, dietician, nurse, bos (if considered a profession). If no, then flatmate, name, infinitive. But 'flatmate' is a person, not a profession.",
