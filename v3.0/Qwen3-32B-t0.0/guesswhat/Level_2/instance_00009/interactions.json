The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe']",

The user wants me to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down, and I can ask up to 7 questions before guessing. The key is to split the list in a way that each question halves the possibilities as much as possible.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. Looking at the list, I notice that some are trees and others are animals. The first four (Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine) are all types of trees, while the last four (Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe) are animals. So maybe the first question should be whether the word is a type of tree. If the answer is yes, then I can focus on the trees; if no, then the animals. That would split the list into two groups of four each. \n\nSo the first question would be: \"Is the target word a type of tree?\" If the answer is yes, then the possible words are Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine. If no, then it's Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe. Let's assume the answer is no for this example. Then I need to narrow down the animals. Next, maybe ask about characteristics. For example, are they big cats? Lions and Jaguars are big cats, while Deer and Giraffe are",
