Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet, Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. The first four are flowers, the last four are insects or arthropods. So maybe start by asking if it's a flower. If the answer is yes, then narrow down among the four. If no, then it's an insect.\n\nSo first question: Is the target word a flower? That would split the list into two groups. If yes, then possible words are Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet. If no, then Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede.\n\nIf the answer is yes, next question could be about color or type. For example, does it have a strong fragrance? Gardenia is known for being fragrant. Lilac is also fragrant, but maybe others less so. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a type of violet. Wait, Violet is both a flower and a color. But the question can't be about structure or spelling. So maybe ask if it's a perennial plant? Lilac and Gardenia might be perennials, while Pansy is a biennial or annual. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's commonly used in perfumes.
