	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Minnow', 'Goldfish', 'Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Exclamation', 'Speaking', 'Adverb', 'Verb']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder, Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize them. The first four are fish, right? Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder. The next four are related to language: Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb. So maybe the first question is to split them into fish vs. non-fish. Let me check: Minnow is a small fish, Goldfish is a common pet, Halibut and Flounder are types of flatfish. Exclamation is a type of sentence, Speaking is an action, Adverb and Verb are parts of speech. So yes, that split makes sense.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first question should be: Is the target word a type of fish? If the answer is yes, then the options are the first four. If no, then the other four. That would split the list in half. Let's ask that.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the target word a type of fish?
