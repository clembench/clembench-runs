Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Propane, Kerosene, Petroleum, Coal, Major, Lieutenant, Corporal, Sergeant. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. The first four are types of fuels or energy sources. The last four are military ranks. So maybe the first question should be about whether the word is a fuel or a military rank. That would split the list into two groups of four each.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the target word a type of fuel or energy source? If the answer is yes, then the options are Propane, Kerosene, Petroleum, Coal. If no, then it's one of the military ranks. \n\nLet me check if that's a valid question. The question is about the category, not the structure or spelling. Yes, that's allowed. So I'll start with that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a type of fuel or energy source?<|im_end|>",
