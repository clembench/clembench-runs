Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has words like Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean, and then some units of measurement like Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard. \n\nFirst, I should probably separate the words into categories. The first four (Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean) are all natural geographical features or bodies of water. The last four are units of length. So maybe the first question should be to determine if the target is a unit of measurement or a natural feature.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the target word a unit of length? If the answer is yes, then I can focus on Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard. If no, then it's one of the first four. Let's ask that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a unit of length?<|im_end|>",
