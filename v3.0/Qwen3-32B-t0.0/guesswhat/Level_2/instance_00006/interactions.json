The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Canoe', 'Skiff', 'Battleship', 'Destroyer', 'Flood', 'Earthquake', 'Typhoon', 'Tornado']",

The list has eight words: Canoe, Skiff, Battleship, Destroyer, Flood, Earthquake, Typhoon, Tornado. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. The first four are types of boats or ships. The last four are natural disasters. So maybe start by asking if it's a type of boat. That would split the list into two groups of four each. If the answer is yes, then I can focus on the boat words; if no, then the natural disasters.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the target word a type of boat? Let's ask that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a type of boat?",
