Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape, Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, and Grape are all plants or fruits. The others are musical instruments. So maybe start by asking if it's a musical instrument. That would split the list into two groups. If the answer is yes, then the options are Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone. If no, then it's one of the four plants.\n\nSo the first question should be: Is the target word a musical instrument? That would narrow it down to four either way. Then, depending on the answer, I can ask more specific questions. For example, if it's a musical instrument, maybe ask if it's a woodwind instrument. All of them are woodwinds except maybe none. Wait, Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, and Saxophone are all woodwinds. So that question might not help. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a reed instrument. But I need to make sure the question is yes/no and not about specific characteristics. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if it's a plant, maybe ask if it's a fruit. Avocado and Grape are fruits, while Lettuce and Kale",
