	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Asparagus', 'Celery', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Television', 'Radio', 'Noisemaker', 'Fan']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke, Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should try to categorize them. The first four are vegetables, and the last four are objects related to sound or media. So maybe start by asking if it's a vegetable. If the answer is yes, then narrow down among the four. If no, then look at the other four.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a vegetable directly. Hmm. Maybe I can ask if it's a type of plant? That might work. Let me try that. If the answer is yes, then it's one of the first four. If no, then it's one of the others.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe ask if it's something you eat. But that's similar to being a vegetable. Let's go with the first idea. Let's ask if it's a plant. If yes, then next question could be if it's a leafy green. Spinach and maybe others. But need to be careful. Let's start with the first question.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Is the target word a type of plant?
