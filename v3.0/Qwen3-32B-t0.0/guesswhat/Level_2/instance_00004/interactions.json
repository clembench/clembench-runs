The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Lawyer', 'Attorney', 'Clerk', 'Salesperson', 'Screwdriver', 'Awl', 'Knife', 'Axe']",

The list is: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson, Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories or commonalities among the words. Let me group them. The first four are all professions or job titles: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson. The last four are tools or objects: Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. So maybe the first question should be to determine if the target is a profession or a tool.\n\nIf I ask, \"Is the target word a profession?\" and the answer is yes, then I can narrow it down to the first four. If no, then it's one of the tools. That would split the list in half, which is a good start. Let me try that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a profession?",
