I need to figure out which word is the target from the given list using as few yes/no questions as possible. The list is: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson, Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories or commonalities among the words. Let me group them. The first four are all professions or job titles: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson. The last four are tools or objects: Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. So maybe the first question should be to determine if the target is a profession or a tool.\n\nIf I ask, \"Is the target word a profession?\" and the answer is yes, then I can narrow it down to the first four. If no, then it's one of the tools. That would split the list in half, which is a good start. Let me try that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a profession?<|im_end|>",
