The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Spoon', 'Cup', 'Bowl', 'Ladle', 'Tequila', 'Brandy', 'Margarita', 'Martini']",

The challenge is to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down, and I can only ask up to 7 questions. Then I have to guess the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. Let me list them again. The first four are kitchen utensils: Spoon, Cup, Bowl, Ladle. The next four are alcoholic drinks: Tequila, Brandy, Margarita, Martini. So maybe the first question should be to split them into these two groups. If I ask, \"Is the target a kitchen utensil?\" If the answer is yes, then I can focus on the first four. If no, then it's one of the drinks. That would split the list in half right away. That seems like a good first question. Let me try that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target a kitchen utensil?",
