The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Carp', 'Catfish', 'Grouper', 'Mackerel', 'Minnow', 'Goldfish']",

The list is Halibut, Flounder, Carp, Catfish, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow, Goldfish. All of them are fish, so maybe I can categorize them based on some characteristics.\n\nFirst, maybe I can ask if the fish is a freshwater fish. Because some of these are freshwater and others are saltwater. For example, Carp and Goldfish are freshwater. Halibut, Flounder, Mackerel, Grouper are usually saltwater. Catfish can be both, but maybe the target is one of them. Wait, but the list includes Catfish, so maybe that's a possibility. If I ask if it's a freshwater fish, and the answer is yes, then the options would be Carp, Goldfish, maybe Catfish. If no, then the others. Let me try that first question.\n\nSo the first question would be: Is the fish a freshwater species? That should split the list into two groups. Let's see. If the answer is yes, then possible candidates are Carp, Goldfish, Catfish (since some catfish are freshwater). If no, then Halibut, Flounder, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow. Wait, Minnow is freshwater too. Oh, right, Minnow is a freshwater fish. So if the answer is no",
