The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Reverend', 'Rabbi', 'Nun', 'Monk', 'Minister', 'Pastor', 'Archbishop', 'Cardinal']",

The challenge is to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down in as few as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common traits among these words. They all seem to be religious titles or roles. Let me categorize them. Some are Christian (Reverend, Minister, Pastor, Archbishop, Cardinal), some are Jewish (Rabbi), and others are from monastic orders (Nun, Monk). \n\nSo maybe start by asking if the word is associated with Christianity. If the answer is yes, then I can eliminate Rabbi. If no, maybe it's Rabbi or the others. Wait, but Nun and Monk could be in different religions too, but in the list given, they're probably Christian. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if the role is specifically a clergy member in a Christian denomination. That might help split the list.\n\nAnother angle: some of these roles have hierarchical positions. For example, Cardinal and Archbishop are higher ranks. Maybe ask if the word is a high-ranking position. But I need to phrase it as a yes/no question. Like, \"Is the target word a high-ranking religious leader?\" If yes, then Cardinal or Archbishop. If no, maybe the others.\n\nAlternatively, think about gender",
