Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Pineapple, Banana, Melon, Pear, Lemon, Orange, Apricot, Mango. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, and then one guess. The questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, so I have to think about their characteristics.\n\nFirst, maybe categorize them. Some are tropical, some are common in certain regions. Let's see. Pineapple is definitely tropical. Banana is too. Melon could be either, but maybe more common in some areas. Pear is probably not tropical. Lemon and Orange are citrus, so maybe more common in Mediterranean or subtropical. Apricot is a bit of a mix, maybe. Mango is definitely tropical. So maybe first question: Is the fruit tropical? If yes, then possible candidates are Pineapple, Banana, Melon, Mango. If no, then Pear, Lemon, Orange, Apricot. Wait, but Melon might be a bit of a gray area. Maybe some melons are tropical, like cantaloupe, but others are not. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a citrus fruit. That would split Lemon and Orange. But maybe that's too specific. Let's try the tropical question first.\n\nSo first question: Is the target fruit considered a tropical fruit? If yes, then possible options are Pineapple, Banana, Melon",
