	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Gardenia', 'Lilac', 'Tulip', 'Lily', 'Pansy', 'Violet', 'Marigold', 'Petunia']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Gardenia, Lilac, Tulip, Lily, Pansy, Violet, Marigold, Petunia. The challenge is to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down in as few as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for categories or characteristics that can split the list into halves or more. Since all are flowers, maybe categorize by type. For example, some are perennials, some annuals. But I don't know if that's a common knowledge. Alternatively, maybe color? But the user can't answer about color directly. Wait, the rules say questions can't be about specific characteristics like structure or spelling. So I can't ask "Is it a color?" or "Does it start with a vowel?".\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe think about common attributes. For example, "Is it a flower that is commonly used in bouquets?" That might split them. Let's see: Gardenia is often in bouquets, Lilac maybe less so, Tulip yes, Lily yes, Pansy maybe, Violet maybe, Marigold sometimes, Petunia maybe. Not sure if that's a good split. Alternatively, maybe if it's a bulb plant? Tulip and Lily are bulb plants. Gardenia is a shrub. Lilac is a shrub. Pans
