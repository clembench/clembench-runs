The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Banjo', 'Guitar', 'Drum', 'Cymbal', 'Bugle', 'Trombone', 'Mandolin', 'Harp']",

The challenge is to ask as few yes/no questions as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words to narrow down. Let me think about common categories. Maybe start by dividing them into string instruments and percussion. But wait, some might be in both categories? Let me check:\n\n- Banjo: string\n- Guitar: string\n- Drum: percussion\n- Cymbal: percussion\n- Bugle: brass\n- Trombone: brass\n- Mandolin: string\n- Harp: string\n\nSo, if I ask if it's a string instrument, that would eliminate Drum, Cymbal, Bugle, Trombone. The answer could be yes or no. If yes, then possible words are Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Harp. If no, then the options are the others. Let's try that first question.\n\nBut wait, the user said questions can't be about the structure or specific characteristics. Wait, the question about being a string instrument is about the type, which is a category. Is that allowed? The rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe \"Is it a string instrument?\" is",
