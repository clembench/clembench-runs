	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Nephew', 'Uncle', 'Grandfather', 'Grandmother', 'Father', 'Mother', 'Wife', 'Husband']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Nephew, Uncle, Grandfather, Grandmother, Father, Mother, Wife, Husband. The challenge is to ask as few yes/no questions as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize the words. Let's list them again:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Nephew\\ \tt 2. Uncle\\ \tt 3. Grandfather\\ \tt 4. Grandmother\\ \tt 5. Father\\ \tt 6. Mother\\ \tt 7. Wife\\ \tt 8. Husband\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Let's think about relationships. Some are direct parents (Father, Mother), others are siblings (Uncle, Aunt, but Aunt isn't in the list here). Nephew is a child of a sibling. Grandfather and Grandmother are parents of parents. Wife and Husband are spouses.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe start by determining if the target is a parent or a child. Wait, but Nephew is a child, but the others like Father, Mother, Grandparents are parents or grandparents. So maybe first question: Is the target a parent (Father, Mother, Grandfather, Grandmother) or a child (Nephew) or a sibling (Uncle) or a spouse (Wife, Husband)?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the question has to be yes/no and not about the structure. So maybe first question: Is the target a direct parent (Father or Mother)? If yes, then
