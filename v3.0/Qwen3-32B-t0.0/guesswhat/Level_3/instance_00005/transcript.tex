	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Turquoise', 'Opal', 'Topaz', 'Amethyst', 'Pearl', 'Ruby', 'Aquamarine', 'Emerald']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which of these gemstones is the target word by asking yes/no questions. The list is Turquoise, Opal, Topaz, Amethyst, Pearl, Ruby, Aquamarine, Emerald. First, I should think about categories or properties that can split the list into halves or more.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe start with color? But the user said questions can't be about specific characteristics like color. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask "Is it a blue gemstone?" because that's about color. So I need to think of other attributes.\\ \tt \\ \tt What about whether the gemstone is a birthstone for a particular month? For example, Ruby is July, Pearl is June, etc. But I don't know if that's a valid question. Wait, the user didn't specify that the target is a birthstone, but maybe that's a common attribute. Let me check: Turquoise is November, Opal is October, Topaz is November, Amethyst is February, Pearl is June, Ruby is July, Aquamarine is March, Emerald is May. So if I ask if it's a birthstone for a month, that might split them. But maybe not all of them are birthstones. Wait, all of them are in the list of birthstones. So that might not help. Hmm
