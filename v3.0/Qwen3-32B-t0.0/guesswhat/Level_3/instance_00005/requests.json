I need to figure out which of these gemstones is the target word by asking yes/no questions. The list is Turquoise, Opal, Topaz, Amethyst, Pearl, Ruby, Aquamarine, Emerald. First, I should think about categories or properties that can split the list into halves or more.\n\nHmm, maybe start with color? But the user said questions can't be about specific characteristics like color. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask \"Is it a blue gemstone?\" because that's about color. So I need to think of other attributes.\n\nWhat about whether the gemstone is a birthstone for a particular month? For example, Ruby is July, Pearl is June, etc. But I don't know if that's a valid question. Wait, the user didn't specify that the target is a birthstone, but maybe that's a common attribute. Let me check: Turquoise is November, Opal is October, Topaz is November, Amethyst is February, Pearl is June, Ruby is July, Aquamarine is March, Emerald is May. So if I ask if it's a birthstone for a month, that might split them. But maybe not all of them are birthstones. Wait, all of them are in the list of birthstones. So that might not help. Hmm",
