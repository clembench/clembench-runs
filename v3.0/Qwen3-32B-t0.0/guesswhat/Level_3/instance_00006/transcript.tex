	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Stockings', 'Tights', 'Scarf', 'Shirt', 'Panties', 'Pants', 'Underwear', 'Bra']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Stockings, Tights, Scarf, Shirt, Panties, Pants, Underwear, Bra. The challenge is to ask as few yes/no questions as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize the words to narrow down. Let's look at the list. Some are clothing items. Maybe I can start by determining if the item is worn on the upper body or lower body. For example, Scarf and Shirt are upper body, while Stockings, Tights, Panties, Pants, Underwear, Bra are lower body or undergarments. Wait, Bra is upper body undergarment. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first question: Is the item worn on the upper body? If yes, then possible answers are Scarf, Shirt, Bra. If no, then it's lower body or undergarments. Let's try that.\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then next question could be about being an undergarment. For example, Is it an undergarment? If yes, then Bra. If no, then Scarf or Shirt. But maybe another approach. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's an undergarment first. Let's see.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe start with whether it's an undergarment. Because several words are in that category: Panties, Underwear, Bra, maybe also Stock
