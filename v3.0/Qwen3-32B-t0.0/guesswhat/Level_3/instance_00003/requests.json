Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Bug, Termite, Ant, Bee, Gnat, Mosquito, Butterfly, Moth. The challenge is to ask as few yes/no questions as possible, up to 7, and then make a single guess.\n\nFirst, I should think about categories or characteristics that can split the list into halves or more. Since all are insects, maybe look for broader classifications. For example, some are social insects (like ants, termites, bees), others are not. Or maybe whether they have wings. But wait, some like moths and butterflies have wings, but so do bees and wasps. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: do they have a stinger? Bees, wasps, ants (some species), but not all. But the list includes ants, bees, maybe termites? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe their primary diet: some are herbivores, others feed on other insects or blood. For example, mosquitoes feed on blood, gnats might be similar. Butterflies and moths feed on nectar. Bugs like aphids feed on plants. But the list includes 'Bug' as a general term, which might be tricky.\n\nWait, the first word is 'Bug', which is a general term for insects. But the others are specific types. So maybe the target is 'Bug' if the question is about being a general term. But",
