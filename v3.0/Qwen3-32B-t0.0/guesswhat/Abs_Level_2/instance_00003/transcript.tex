	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['lunchtime', 'suppertime', 'breakfast', 'teatime', 'anorexia', 'bulimia', 'sociopath', 'psychopath']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: lunchtime, suppertime, breakfast, teatime, anorexia, bulimia, sociopath, psychopath.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should group them into categories. The first four are times of the day related to meals. The next two are eating disorders. The last two are psychological terms, but they're about personality disorders, not eating. So maybe start by asking if the word is related to a meal time. That would split the list into two groups: meal times (4 words) vs. the other four. If the answer is yes, then I can ask about specific times. If not, then I need to check if it's an eating disorder or a personality disorder.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first question could be: Is the word a time of day associated with eating? That would cover lunchtime, suppertime, breakfast, teatime. If yes, then next question could be about whether it's a specific time like breakfast or a more general one like lunchtime. Alternatively, maybe ask if it's a specific meal time (like breakfast) versus a more general one (like teatime). But maybe better to split the group in half. Since there are four meal times, maybe ask if it's a main meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) versus a snack time (teatime). But the words
