Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology, gp, surgeon, dentist, physician.\n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common characteristics. The first four words end with \"-ology,\" which might indicate they are medical specialties. The others like gp, surgeon, dentist, physician are more specific roles or titles. So maybe the first step is to determine if the target is a specialty or a specific role.\n\nSo my first question could be: Is the target word a medical specialty? If yes, then I can focus on the first four. If no, then it's one of the others. Let's ask that.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then I have four options: pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology. Next, I need to narrow these down. Maybe ask about the body system or type of treatment. For example, does it involve the skin? That would be dermatology. Or maybe imaging? Radiology. Cancer? Oncology. Autopsies or disease study? Pathology.\n\nIf the answer to the first question is no, then the options are gp, surgeon, dentist, physician. Gp is a general practitioner, surgeon is a specific role, dentist is a different field, and physician is a broader term. Maybe ask if it's a specific type of doctor (surgeon, dentist",
