Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has 'sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word', 'verb', 'adverb'. \n\nFirst, I should look for categories or common attributes. The first four words are ordinal numbers (sixth, fourth, third, tenth), while the others are parts of speech or general terms. Maybe start by checking if the target is an ordinal number. So the first question could be: Is the target word an ordinal number? If yes, then the options are the first four. If no, then it's among the last four.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then I can narrow down further. For example, maybe ask if it's in the top half (sixth, fourth) or the bottom half (third, tenth). But wait, the first four are all ordinals. Alternatively, maybe check if it's a number that's a multiple of three? Third and sixth are multiples of three, fourth and tenth are not. But that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe ask if the number is higher than five. Sixth and tenth are higher than five, fourth and third are not. That could split them into two groups.\n\nIf the answer to the first question is no, then the remaining words are 'name', 'word', 'verb', 'adverb'. These are all parts of speech except",
