Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: nanometre, centimetre, mile, fathom, hairdresser, plumber, author, presenter. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. The first four are units of measurement, and the last four are professions. So maybe start by asking if it's a unit of measurement. That would split the list into two groups of four. If the answer is yes, then I can focus on the units; if no, then the professions.\n\nSo the first question should be: Is the target word a unit of measurement? That way, I can narrow down to four options either way. Let's go with that.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a unit of measurement?<|im_end|>",
