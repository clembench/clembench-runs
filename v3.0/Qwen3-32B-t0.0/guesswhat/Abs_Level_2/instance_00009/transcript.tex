	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['shoplifting', 'robbery', 'stealing', 'burglary', 'building', 'monument', 'illustration', 'drawing']

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary, building, monument, illustration, drawing. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should try to categorize them. The first four words (shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary) all relate to theft or stealing. The next three (building, monument, illustration) and drawing are more about structures or art. So maybe start by asking if the word is related to theft. That would split the list into two groups: the first four and the last four.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first question could be: Is the word related to stealing or theft? If the answer is yes, then the target is one of the first four. If no, then it's among the last four. \\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking about the category is okay. Let me check the rules again. Rule 2 says questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe "related to stealing" is a category, which is allowed. \\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then I have four words left. Then I can ask another question to narrow down. For example, if it's a specific type of theft. Like, "Does it involve entering a building?" That would separate burglary from the others. Or maybe "Is it a general term for
