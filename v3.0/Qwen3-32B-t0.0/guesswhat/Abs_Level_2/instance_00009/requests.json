The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary, building, monument, illustration, drawing. \n\nFirst, I should try to categorize them. The first four words (shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary) all relate to theft or stealing. The next three (building, monument, illustration) and drawing are more about structures or art. So maybe start by asking if the word is related to theft. That would split the list into two groups: the first four and the last four.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the word related to stealing or theft? If the answer is yes, then the target is one of the first four. If no, then it's among the last four. \n\nBut wait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking about the category is okay. Let me check the rules again. Rule 2 says questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe \"related to stealing\" is a category, which is allowed. \n\nIf the answer is yes, then I have four words left. Then I can ask another question to narrow down. For example, if it's a specific type of theft. Like, \"Does it involve entering a building?\" That would separate burglary from the others. Or maybe \"Is it a general term for",
