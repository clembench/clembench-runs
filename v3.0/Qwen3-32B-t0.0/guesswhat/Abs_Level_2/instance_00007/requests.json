Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words. The first thing I notice is that some are family terms and others are geometric shapes. So maybe I can split them into those two categories.\n\nFirst question: Is the target word a family relationship term? If yes, then the options are grandson, granddaughter, mother-in-law, sister-in-law. If no, then it's one of the geometric shapes: trapezium, parallelogram, decahedron, dodecahedron. That would split the list in half, right? Let me check. There are four family terms and four geometric terms. So asking that question would narrow it down to four options either way. That seems efficient. Let me go with that as the first question.\n</think>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a family relationship term?<|im_end|>",
