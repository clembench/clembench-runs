Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word is the target by asking yes/no questions. The list has eight words: hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming, hostile, friendly, leader, extrovert. \n\nFirst, I should try to categorize them. Some are activities (hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming) and others are adjectives or nouns related to personality (hostile, friendly, leader, extrovert). Maybe start by asking if the word is an activity. If the answer is yes, then narrow down between the four. If not, focus on the personality traits.\n\nBut wait, \"hurdle\" can be a noun (the obstacle) or part of an event (like hurdle race). But the question is about the word itself. Hmm. Let me think. The first question could be: Is the word a sport or physical activity? That would group hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming together. If yes, then next question to narrow down. If no, then it's one of the other four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if the word is related to water. Because surfing and swimming are water-related. But hurdle and fencing are not. Hostile, friendly, leader, extrovert aren't either. So if the answer is yes, then it's either surfing or swimming. If no, then the other six. But that might not split the list as effectively.
