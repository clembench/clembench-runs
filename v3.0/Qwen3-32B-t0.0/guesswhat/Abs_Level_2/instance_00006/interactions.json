The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['tsar', 'king', 'princes', 'prince', 'noon', 'dusk', 'afternoon', 'evening']",

The list has words like tsar, king, princes, prince, noon, dusk, afternoon, evening. \n\nFirst, I should categorize them. Some are titles (tsar, king, princes, prince) and others are times of day (noon, dusk, afternoon, evening). So maybe start by asking if the word is a title. That would split the list into two groups. If the answer is yes, then I have four options. If no, then the other four.\n\nSo the first question could be: Is the word a title of a monarch or noble? That would cover tsar, king, princes, prince. If yes, then next step. If no, then it's one of the time-related words.\n\nAssuming the answer is yes, then I have four options. Next, maybe ask if it's a singular or plural. For example, princes and prince are plural and singular. But tsar and king are singular. Wait, princes is plural, prince is singular. So maybe ask if it's a plural form. If yes, then it's princes. If no, then tsar, king, or prince. But that might not be the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ask if the word refers to a male monarch. Tsar and king are male, while prince could be a son of a king. But princes is",
