The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid is a 5x5 grid, right? Each row has five cells. The first four rows have the first cell as a square (▢) and the rest as Xs. The fifth row is all squares. Let me count again to make sure. First row: ▢ followed by four Xs. Second row same. Third and fourth rows the same. Then the fifth row is five ▢s. So the pattern is that the first four rows have a single square in the first column and Xs in the rest, and the last row is all squares. I need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the size, the pattern in each row, and the fifth row being all squares. Let me make sure I don't miss any details. The user will compare this with their own grid, so accuracy is key. I should avoid any extra information and just state the facts. Alright, time to put it into a concise description.\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where the first four rows each have a single square (▢) in the first column and four Xs (X) in the remaining columns.
