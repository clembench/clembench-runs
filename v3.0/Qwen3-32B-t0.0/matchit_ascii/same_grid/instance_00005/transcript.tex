	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let me start by looking at the grid provided. It's a 5x5 grid with some X's and empty squares (▢). My task is to describe this grid accurately so that when the user provides their description, we can compare and figure out if they're the same.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to note the positions of the X's. Let me go row by row. \\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: The first row has X's in columns 2, 3, and 4. So positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The first and fifth columns are empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: Here, the X is only in column 3 and 4. So (2,3) and (2,4). The first, second, and fifth columns are empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3: X's in column 2 and 4. So (3,2) and (3,4). The first, third, and fifth columns are empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 4: X's in columns 2 and 3. So (4,2) and (4,3). The fourth and fifth columns are empty here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 5: X's in columns 2, 3, and 4. So (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The first and fifth columns are empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any
