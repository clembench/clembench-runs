It's a 5x5 grid with some X's and empty squares (▢). My task is to describe this grid accurately so that when the user provides their description, we can compare and figure out if they're the same.\n\nFirst, I need to note the positions of the X's. Let me go row by row. \n\nRow 1: The first row has X's in columns 2, 3, and 4. So positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The first and fifth columns are empty.\n\nRow 2: Here, the X is only in column 3 and 4. So (2,3) and (2,4). The first, second, and fifth columns are empty.\n\nRow 3: X's in column 2 and 4. So (3,2) and (3,4). The first, third, and fifth columns are empty.\n\nRow 4: X's in columns 2 and 3. So (4,2) and (4,3). The fourth and fifth columns are empty here.\n\nRow 5: X's in columns 2, 3, and 4. So (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). The first and fifth columns are empty.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any",
