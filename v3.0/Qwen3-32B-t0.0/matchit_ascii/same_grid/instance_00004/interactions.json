So that's five Xs in a row. Then the second row has two empty squares (▢), then an X, then two more empty squares. The same pattern repeats for the third, fourth, and fifth rows. So each of the rows from the second to the fifth has an X in the third column, with the rest being empty except the first row which is all Xs.\n\nSo the description should mention the size (5x5), the first row being all Xs, and the subsequent rows having an X only in the middle (third column) with the rest empty. I need to make sure to note the positions accurately. Let me check again: rows 2-5 have X in column 3, others are empty. Yes. So the key points are the first row all Xs, and then each of the next four rows has a single X in the center. That's the pattern. I should phrase it clearly so the user can compare with their own grid. Maybe mention the positions as row and column numbers? Wait, the user might have a different orientation. But the way the grid is presented here, rows are horizontal, columns vertical. So row 1 is all Xs, rows 2-5 have X in column 3",
