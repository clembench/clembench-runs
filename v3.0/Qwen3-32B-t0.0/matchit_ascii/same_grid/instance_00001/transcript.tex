	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let me start by looking at the grid provided. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid is a 5x5 grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me count the positions to make sure I understand the pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the first row: all X's. Then the second row has X, ▢, X, ▢, X. The third row is the same as the second. The fourth row is the same as the second and third. The fifth row is all X's again. So the pattern is that the first and last rows are all X's. The middle three rows (rows 2, 3, 4) have X's in the first, third, and fifth columns, and ▢'s in the second and fourth columns. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me check again. Each of the middle rows has X in column 1, ▢ in 2, X in 3, ▢ in 4, X in 5. So the ▢'s are in even columns (2 and 4) for rows 2-4. The first and last rows are all X's. So the description should mention that the first and fifth rows are all X's, and the middle three rows have X's in columns 1, 3, 5 and ▢'s in 2 and 4. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure the description is clear and
