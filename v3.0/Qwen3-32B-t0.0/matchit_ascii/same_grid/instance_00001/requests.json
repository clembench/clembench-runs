The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid is a 5x5 grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me count the positions to make sure I understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at the first row: all X's. Then the second row has X, ▢, X, ▢, X. The third row is the same as the second. The fourth row is the same as the second and third. The fifth row is all X's again. So the pattern is that the first and last rows are all X's. The middle three rows (rows 2, 3, 4) have X's in the first, third, and fifth columns, and ▢'s in the second and fourth columns. \n\nWait, let me check again. Each of the middle rows has X in column 1, ▢ in 2, X in 3, ▢ in 4, X in 5. So the ▢'s are in even columns (2 and 4) for rows 2-4. The first and last rows are all X's. So the description should mention that the first and fifth rows are all X's, and the middle three rows have X's in columns 1, 3, 5 and ▢'s in 2 and 4. \n\nI need to make sure the description is clear and",
