Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row: All X's. So five Xs in a row. Second row: Same as the first, all Xs. Third row: Hmm, the third row has two squares (▢), then an X, then two more squares. So the third row is ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. The fourth and fifth rows are all Xs again. \n\nSo the only difference is the third row. The rest are all Xs. I need to make sure I describe this correctly. Let me count the positions. The third row, middle is X, and the others are squares. So in the middle of the grid, there's a single X surrounded by squares? Wait, no. The third row is the middle row of the 5x5 grid. So the entire grid is mostly Xs except for the middle row, which has squares on the left and right, and an X in the center. \n\nI should describe it as a 5x5 grid where all cells are X except for the third row, which has two squares on the left, an X in the middle, and two squares on the right. That way, the user can compare their description. I need to make sure the description is clear and concise. Let me put",
