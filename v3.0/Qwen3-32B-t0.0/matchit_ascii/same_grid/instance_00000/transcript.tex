	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me count the rows and columns to make sure I understand it correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: all X's. Second row: one X followed by four ▢'s. Third row: three X's and then two ▢'s. Fourth row: one X followed by four ▢'s. Fifth row: all X's again. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the positions of the X's and ▢'s. Let me check each row again. \\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: All Xs. So that's straightforward. Row 2: First cell is X, then four ▢s. Row 3: First three cells are X, then two ▢s. Row 4: First cell X, then four ▢s. Row 5: All Xs. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should note the pattern. The first and last rows are all Xs. The second and fourth rows start with X and then have four ▢s. The third row has three Xs followed by two ▢s. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe I should mention the coordinates or positions. But the user said to keep it short. So probably just a general description. Let me make sure I don't make a mistake. \\ \tt \\ \tt Yes, that's the grid. So the
