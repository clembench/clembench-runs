Fourth row: one X followed by four ▢'s. Fifth row: all X's again. \n\nI need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the positions of the X's and ▢'s. Let me check each row again. \n\nRow 1: All Xs. So that's straightforward. Row 2: First cell is X, then four ▢s. Row 3: First three cells are X, then two ▢s. Row 4: First cell X, then four ▢s. Row 5: All Xs. \n\nI should note the pattern. The first and last rows are all Xs. The second and fourth rows start with X and then have four ▢s. The third row has three Xs followed by two ▢s. \n\nWait, maybe I should mention the coordinates or positions. But the user said to keep it short. So probably just a general description.
