Let me go row by row.\n\nFirst row: all five are empty squares (▢). So that's five empty cells. Second row: the first cell is empty, then four Xs. Third row: three empty cells followed by two Xs. Fourth row: one empty cell and then four Xs. Fifth row: same as the fourth, one empty and four Xs. Wait, let me check again. The user's grid is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢  \nRow 2: ▢ X X X X  \nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ X X  \nRow 4: ▢ X X X X  \nRow 5: ▢ X X X X  \n\nSo the first row is all empty. The second row starts with an empty, then four Xs. Third row has three empties and two Xs. Fourth and fifth rows each have one empty and four Xs. \n\nI need to describe this concisely. Maybe mention the positions of the Xs. Let's see. For each row, note the number of empty cells and Xs. But maybe it's better to use coordinates. But the user might prefer a simple count per row.
