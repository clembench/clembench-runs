	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares. Let me visualize it again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So each row has one X, and they're positioned in different columns. Let me note the positions. Maybe it's easier to list the coordinates. Let's number the rows from top to bottom as 1 to 5 and columns left to right as 1 to 5.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X is at column 5 (1,5)\\ \tt Row 2: X at column 4 (2,4)\\ \tt Row 3: X at column 3 (3,3)\\ \tt Row 4: X at column 2 (4,2)\\ \tt Row 5: X at column 1 (5,1)\\ \tt \\ \tt So the X's are moving diagonally from the top right to the bottom left. Each subsequent row has the X one column to the left and one row down. That's a diagonal pattern. So the description should mention that each row has a single X, and their positions form a diagonal from top
