The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares. Let me visualize it again.\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo each row has one X, and they're positioned in different columns. Let me note the positions. Maybe it's easier to list the coordinates. Let's number the rows from top to bottom as 1 to 5 and columns left to right as 1 to 5.\n\nRow 1: X is at column 5 (1,5)\nRow 2: X at column 4 (2,4)\nRow 3: X at column 3 (3,3)\nRow 4: X at column 2 (4,2)\nRow 5: X at column 1 (5,1)\n\nSo the X's are moving diagonally from the top right to the bottom left. Each subsequent row has the X one column to the left and one row down. That's a diagonal pattern. So the description should mention that each row has a single X, and their positions form a diagonal from top",
