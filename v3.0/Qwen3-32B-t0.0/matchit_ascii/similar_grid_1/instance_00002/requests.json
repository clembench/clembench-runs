The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\nRow 2: X, X, ▢, X, X\nRow 3: X, ▢, X, ▢, X\nRow 4: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\nRow 5: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\n\nI should note the positions of the X's. Maybe mention the coordinates or just describe the pattern. Since the user will compare it to their own grid, I need to be precise. Let me check each row again to make sure I didn't transpose any columns. \n\nRow 1 has X's in columns 1 and 5. Row 2 has X's in 1, 2, 4, 5. Row 3 has X's in 1, 3, 5. Row 4 and 5 have X's in 1 and 5, with empty squares in between. \n\nI should describe each row's X positions. Maybe list them as (row, column) pairs. But the user might prefer a more visual description. Alternatively, mention that the first and last columns",
