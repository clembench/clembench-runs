Maybe mention the coordinates or just describe the pattern. Since the user will compare it to their own grid, I need to be precise. Let me check each row again to make sure I didn't transpose any columns. \n\nRow 1 has X's in columns 1 and 5. Row 2 has X's in 1, 2, 4, 5. Row 3 has X's in 1, 3, 5. Row 4 and 5 have X's in 1 and 5, with empty squares in between. \n\nI should describe each row's X positions. Maybe list them as (row, column) pairs.
