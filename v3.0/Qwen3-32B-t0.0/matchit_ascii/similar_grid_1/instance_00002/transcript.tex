	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 2: X, X, ▢, X, X\\ \tt Row 3: X, ▢, X, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 4: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 5: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt \\ \tt I should note the positions of the X's. Maybe mention the coordinates or just describe the pattern. Since the user will compare it to their own grid, I need to be precise. Let me check each row again to make sure I didn't transpose any columns. \\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1 has X's in columns 1 and 5. Row 2 has X's in 1, 2, 4, 5. Row 3 has X's in 1, 3, 5. Row 4 and 5 have X's in 1 and 5, with empty squares in between. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should describe each row's X positions. Maybe list them as (row, column) pairs. But the user might prefer a more visual description. Alternatively, mention that the first and last columns
