	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let me count the X's to make sure I understand the pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – so the third position is X.\\ \tt Second row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – same as the first row, third position X.\\ \tt Third row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – all empty.\\ \tt Fourth row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – again, third position X.\\ \tt Fifth row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – same as the others, third position X.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the X's are in the middle column (column 3) of rows 1, 2, 4, and 5. Row 3 has no X's. That makes a vertical line of X's in the middle column, except for the third row. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the positions or the pattern. Let me check if there's any other pattern. The X's are in columns 3, rows 1,2,4,5. So it's like a vertical line with a gap in the middle. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should state the grid size, the positions of the X's, and maybe note the absence in the third row. Let me
