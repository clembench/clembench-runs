Row 3 has no X's. That makes a vertical line of X's in the middle column, except for the third row. \n\nI need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the positions or the pattern. Let me check if there's any other pattern. The X's are in columns 3, rows 1,2,4,5. So it's like a vertical line with a gap in the middle. \n\nI should state the grid size, the positions of the X's, and maybe note the absence in the third row. Let me",
