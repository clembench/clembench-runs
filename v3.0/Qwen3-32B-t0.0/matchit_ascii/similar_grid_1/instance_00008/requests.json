The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and empty squares. Let me count the X's to make sure I understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nFirst row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – so the third position is X.\nSecond row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – same as the first row, third position X.\nThird row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – all empty.\nFourth row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – again, third position X.\nFifth row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ – same as the others, third position X.\n\nSo the X's are in the middle column (column 3) of rows 1, 2, 4, and 5. Row 3 has no X's. That makes a vertical line of X's in the middle column, except for the third row. \n\nI need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the positions or the pattern. Let me check if there's any other pattern. The X's are in columns 3, rows 1,2,4,5. So it's like a vertical line with a gap in the middle. \n\nI should state the grid size, the positions of the X's, and maybe note the absence in the third row. Let me",
