Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: All Xs. So that's five Xs in a row. Second row: Starts with an X, then four squares. Third row: Three Xs followed by two squares. Fourth row: An X, then four squares. Fifth row: Same as the fourth, an X followed by four squares. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The first row is all Xs. The second row is X followed by four squares. Third row is X, X, X, then two squares. Fourth and fifth rows both start with X and then have four squares each. \n\nSo the pattern is that the first row is all Xs. The second row has one X and then squares. The third row has three Xs. The fourth and fifth rows each have one X followed by four squares. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any details. The positions of the Xs and squares are important. Let me count again. \n\nRow 1: 5 Xs. \nRow 2: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢. \nRow 3: X, X, X, ▢, ▢. \nRow 4: X, ▢",
