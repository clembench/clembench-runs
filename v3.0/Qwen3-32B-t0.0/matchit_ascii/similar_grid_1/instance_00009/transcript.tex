	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided has five rows and five columns. Each cell is either an X or a square (▢). Let me go through each row one by one.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: All Xs. So that's five Xs in a row. Second row: Starts with an X, then four squares. Third row: Three Xs followed by two squares. Fourth row: An X, then four squares. Fifth row: Same as the fourth, an X followed by four squares. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me double-check. The first row is all Xs. The second row is X followed by four squares. Third row is X, X, X, then two squares. Fourth and fifth rows both start with X and then have four squares each. \\ \tt \\ \tt So the pattern is that the first row is all Xs. The second row has one X and then squares. The third row has three Xs. The fourth and fifth rows each have one X followed by four squares. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure I'm not missing any details. The positions of the Xs and squares are important. Let me count again. \\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: 5 Xs. \\ \tt Row 2: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢. \\ \tt Row 3: X, X, X, ▢, ▢. \\ \tt Row 4: X, ▢
