The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). Let me count the X's in each row to make sure I have the right pattern.\n\nFirst row: two empty, then an X, then two empty. So it's ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. Second row is the same as the first. Third row starts with an empty, then three X's, then an empty. Wait, the third row is ▢ X X X ▢. Fourth row is similar to the third, but maybe starts with an X? Wait, looking again: the fourth row is ▢ X X X ▢. Wait, no, the user's grid shows the fourth row as ▢ X X X ▢. Wait, the third and fourth rows both have three X's in the middle. Then the fifth row is all X's: X X X X X.\n\nSo the pattern is symmetrical? Let me check columns. The first column has two empty, then an X, another X, and then an X. Wait, first column: first two rows are empty, third row is empty, fourth row is empty? Wait no, looking at the grid again:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nRow",
