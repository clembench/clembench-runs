	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let me start by looking at the grid provided. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). Let me count the X's in each row to make sure I have the right pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: two empty, then an X, then two empty. So it's ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. Second row is the same as the first. Third row starts with an empty, then three X's, then an empty. Wait, the third row is ▢ X X X ▢. Fourth row is similar to the third, but maybe starts with an X? Wait, looking again: the fourth row is ▢ X X X ▢. Wait, no, the user's grid shows the fourth row as ▢ X X X ▢. Wait, the third and fourth rows both have three X's in the middle. Then the fifth row is all X's: X X X X X.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the pattern is symmetrical? Let me check columns. The first column has two empty, then an X, another X, and then an X. Wait, first column: first two rows are empty, third row is empty, fourth row is empty? Wait no, looking at the grid again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt Row
