	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the grid row by row. The first row is two empty, then an X, then two empty. So maybe I can note the positions of the X's. Let me count each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: positions 3 has an X.\\ \tt Row 2: positions 3 and 4 have X's.\\ \tt Row 3: all positions (1-5) have X's.\\ \tt Row 4: positions 3 and 4 have X's.\\ \tt Row 5: same as row 1, position 3 has an X.\\ \tt \\ \tt I should mention the rows and columns where the X's are. Maybe describe each row's X positions. Also, note any symmetry. The grid seems symmetric vertically because rows 1 and 5 are the same, rows 2 and 4 are the same, and row 3 is all X's. So vertical symmetry. That's a key point. The user's grid might have the same symmetry, so that's something to check.\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure my description is clear and concise. Let me structure it as:\\ \tt \\ \tt - 5x5 grid\\ \tt - X positions in each row\\ \tt - Symmetry note\\ \tt \\ \tt So the description would be something like: "A 5x5
