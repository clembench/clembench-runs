Maybe note the positions of the empty squares. Let's count the rows and columns from 1 to 5. The empty squares are at positions (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), and (5,1). So each row has one empty square, and they form a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left. Wait, is that right? Let me check again.\n\nRow 1: The empty is at column 5 (last position). Row 2: column 4. Row 3: column 3. Row 4: column 2. Row 5: column 1. Yes, that's a diagonal from (1,5) to (5,1). So the empty squares are along the anti-diagonal. The rest are X's. So the description should mention that each row has one empty square, and their positions form a diagonal from top-right to bottom",
