Let me visualize it again to make sure I get the details right.\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ X X ▢ ▢\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: ▢ X X ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that the middle row (row 3) is all X's. That's a clear feature. Then, looking at the other rows, there's symmetry. For example, rows 1 and 5 are the same, and rows 2 and 4 are the same. The X's are placed in a way that might form a sort of cross or maybe a diamond shape. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 1 has an X in the middle (position 3). Row 2 has X's in positions 2 and 3. Row 3 is all X's. Row 4 has X's in positions 2 and 3 again. Row 5 mirrors row 1. So the pattern is symmetric vertically and horizontally. The X's form a sort of hourglass shape with the middle row being the base. Wait, no, maybe it's more",
