The grid is 5x5, right? Each cell has either an X or a square (▢). Let me start by looking at each row.\n\nFirst row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. So the first and last are X, the middle three are empty. Second row: X, X, ▢, ▢, X. First two and last are X, the middle two are empty. Third row: X, ▢, X, ▢, X. Alternating X and empty, starting and ending with X. Fourth row: X, ▢, ▢, X, X. First is X, then two empties, then two Xs. Fifth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Similar to the first row, first and last X, others empty.\n\nI need to make sure I describe it accurately. Maybe mention the positions of the Xs. Let's count the Xs in each row. First row: 2 Xs. Second: 3. Third: 3. Fourth: 3. Fifth: 2. Wait, third row has X in positions 1,3,5. Fourth row has X in 1,4,5. Hmm. Maybe note the symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows are similar",
