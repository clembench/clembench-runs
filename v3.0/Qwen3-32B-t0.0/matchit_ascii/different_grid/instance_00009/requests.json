The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately.\n\nLooking at the grid row by row. The first row is two empty, then an X, then two empty. So maybe I can note the positions of the X's. Let me count each row:\n\nRow 1: positions 3 has an X.\nRow 2: positions 3 and 4 have X's.\nRow 3: all positions (1-5) have X's.\nRow 4: positions 3 and 4 have X's.\nRow 5: same as row 1, position 3 has an X.\n\nI should mention the rows and columns where the X's are. Maybe describe each row's X positions. Also, note any symmetry. The grid seems symmetric vertically because rows 1 and 5 are the same, rows 2 and 4 are the same, and row 3 is all X's. So vertical symmetry. That's a key point. The user's grid might have the same symmetry, so that's something to check.\n\nI need to make sure my description is clear and concise. Let me structure it as:\n\n- 5x5 grid\n- X positions in each row\n- Symmetry note\n\nSo the description would be something like: \"A 5x5",
