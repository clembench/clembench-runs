The grid is a 5x5 grid where each cell is either a box (▢) or an X (X). The pattern seems to have a diagonal of boxes. Let me check each row.\n\nFirst row: The first cell is a box, followed by four Xs. So it's ▢ X X X X.\n\nSecond row: The first cell is X, then a box, then three Xs. So X ▢ X X X.\n\nThird row: X X ▢ X X. Yep, the third cell is the box.\n\nFourth row: X X X ▢ X. The fourth cell is the box.\n\nFifth row: X X X X ▢. The fifth cell is the box.\n\nSo the boxes are along the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. Each row has exactly one box, and the rest are Xs. The other cells are all Xs. So the description should mention that it's a 5x5 grid with a diagonal of boxes from (1,1) to (5,5), and all other cells are X. I need to make sure the description is clear and concise, starting with \"DESCRIPTION:\".\n</think>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where each row and column has exactly one box (▢) and the rest are Xs. The boxes form a diagonal from the top-left to the bottom",
