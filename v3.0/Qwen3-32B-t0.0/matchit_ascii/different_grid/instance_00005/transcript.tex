	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ X X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X X ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X ▢

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe the grid they provided. The grid is a 5x5 grid where each cell is either a box (▢) or an X (X). The pattern seems to have a diagonal of boxes. Let me check each row.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: The first cell is a box, followed by four Xs. So it's ▢ X X X X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: The first cell is X, then a box, then three Xs. So X ▢ X X X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: X X ▢ X X. Yep, the third cell is the box.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fourth row: X X X ▢ X. The fourth cell is the box.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fifth row: X X X X ▢. The fifth cell is the box.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the boxes are along the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. Each row has exactly one box, and the rest are Xs. The other cells are all Xs. So the description should mention that it's a 5x5 grid with a diagonal of boxes from (1,1) to (5,5), and all other cells are X. I need to make sure the description is clear and concise, starting with "DESCRIPTION:".\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where each row and column has exactly one box (▢) and the rest are Xs. The boxes form a diagonal from the top-left to the bottom
