The grid is a 5x5 grid with some X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately so that when they compare it to their own grid, they can figure out if they're the same.\n\nFirst, I'll go row by row. The first row is ▢ X X X ▢. So, the first and last are empty, and the middle three are X's. The second row is X ▢ X ▢ X. So, positions 1, 3, and 5 are X, and 2 and 4 are empty. Third row is X X ▢ X X. The middle is empty, others are X. Fourth row is the same as the second: X ▢ X ▢ X. And the fifth row mirrors the first: ▢ X X X ▢.\n\nI should note the symmetry. The grid looks symmetrical both vertically and horizontally. The center is empty, and the X's form a sort of cross or X shape? Wait, no, maybe not. Let me visualize it again. The first and fifth rows have three X's in the middle. The second and fourth have X's in the first, third, and fifth columns. The third row has X's except the center. So maybe it's like a plus sign in the middle but with some variations. Hmm.\n\nI",
