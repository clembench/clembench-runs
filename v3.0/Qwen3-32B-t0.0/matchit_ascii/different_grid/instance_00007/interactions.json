Third row: X, ▢, X, ▢, X. Alternating X and empty, starting and ending with X. Fourth row: X, X, ▢, ▢, X. First two Xs, then two empty, then X. Fifth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Similar to the first row, first and last X, others empty.\n\nI need to make sure I describe this accurately. Maybe mention the positions of the Xs. Let's count the Xs in each row. First row: 2 Xs. Second: 3. Third: 3. Fourth: 3. Fifth: 2. Wait, that's 2+3+3+3+2=13 Xs total. But maybe the user's grid has the same pattern. Also, check for symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same.
