	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

Let me start by looking at each row.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. So the first and last are X, the middle three are empty. Second row: X, ▢, ▢, X, X. First X, then two empty, then two Xs. Third row: X, ▢, X, ▢, X. Alternating X and empty, starting and ending with X. Fourth row: X, X, ▢, ▢, X. First two Xs, then two empty, then X. Fifth row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Similar to the first row, first and last X, others empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt I need to make sure I describe this accurately. Maybe mention the positions of the Xs. Let's count the Xs in each row. First row: 2 Xs. Second: 3. Third: 3. Fourth: 3. Fifth: 2. Wait, that's 2+3+3+3+2=13 Xs total. But maybe the user's grid has the same pattern. Also, check for symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows have
