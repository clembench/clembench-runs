	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided has five rows and five columns. Let me look at it again.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X followed by four empty squares (▢). Second row: same as the first. Third and fourth rows are the same. The fifth row has five X's. So, rows 1-4 each have an X in the first column and the rest empty. Then the fifth row is all X's. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the size, the pattern in the first four rows, and the fifth row. Let me check if there are any other details. The X's in the first column of rows 1-4 are the only filled cells there. The fifth row is completely filled. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should make sure to note the positions. Maybe say that in rows 1 to 4, only the first cell (column 1) has an X, and the rest are empty. Then the fifth row is all Xs from column 1 to 5. That should cover it. Let me put that into a concise description without any extra words.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid where the first column of the first four rows has an "X" and the rest of the cells in those rows are empty. The fifth row is entirely filled with "X"s across all five columns.
