Maybe mention the symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same, as are the second and fourth rows. The middle row (third) has three X's in the middle. So it's symmetrical along the vertical axis. Also, the X's are placed in a diagonal pattern? Wait, let me check. The first row has X at positions 1 and 5. Second row at 2 and 5. Third row at 3,4,5. Fourth row at 2 and 5. Fifth row at 1 and 5. Hmm, maybe it's a diamond shape? Or maybe a cross? Wait, the middle row is all X's from 3 to 5. So maybe it's a sort of hourglass",
