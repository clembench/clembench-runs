	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with X's and empty squares (▢). I need to make sure I describe it accurately.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 2: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 3: ▢, ▢, X, X, X\\ \tt Row 4: ▢, X, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt Row 5: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X\\ \tt \\ \tt I should note the positions of the X's. Maybe mention the symmetry. The first and fifth rows are the same, as are the second and fourth rows. The middle row (third) has three X's in the middle. So it's symmetrical along the vertical axis. Also, the X's are placed in a diagonal pattern? Wait, let me check. The first row has X at positions 1 and 5. Second row at 2 and 5. Third row at 3,4,5. Fourth row at 2 and 5. Fifth row at 1 and 5. Hmm, maybe it's a diamond shape? Or maybe a cross? Wait, the middle row is all X's from 3 to 5. So maybe it's a sort of hourglass
