	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid. Let me visualize it again to make sure I get the details right.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. So the first and last cells are X, the middle three are empty boxes.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: Same as the first. X at the start and end, three empty in the middle.\\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: All X's. So that's a solid line across the middle.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fourth row: Same as the first two. X, empty, empty, empty, X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fifth row: Same as the first two. X, empty, empty, empty, X.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the overall pattern is like a frame around the middle row. The middle row is all X's, and the other rows have X's only at the first and last positions, with the rest empty. \\ \tt \\ \tt I need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the size (5x5), the positions of the X's. Let me check if there's any symmetry or specific patterns. The first and fifth rows are the same, second and fourth are the same, third is all X's. So it's symmetrical vertically. \\ \tt \\ \tt I should note that the middle row is fully filled, and the other rows have X's only at the ends. That should be enough for the description. Let me make sure
