The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid. Let me visualize it again to make sure I get the details right.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nFirst row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. So the first and last cells are X, the middle three are empty boxes.\n\nSecond row: Same as the first. X at the start and end, three empty in the middle.\n\nThird row: All X's. So that's a solid line across the middle.\n\nFourth row: Same as the first two. X, empty, empty, empty, X.\n\nFifth row: Same as the first two. X, empty, empty, empty, X.\n\nSo the overall pattern is like a frame around the middle row. The middle row is all X's, and the other rows have X's only at the first and last positions, with the rest empty. \n\nI need to describe this clearly. Maybe mention the size (5x5), the positions of the X's. Let me check if there's any symmetry or specific patterns. The first and fifth rows are the same, second and fourth are the same, third is all X's. So it's symmetrical vertically. \n\nI should note that the middle row is fully filled, and the other rows have X's only at the ends. That should be enough for the description. Let me make sure",
