Let me go row by row.\n\nFirst row: All five are X's. So that's straightforward. Second row: The first four are empty, and the fifth is X. Third row: The first two are empty, then three X's. Fourth row: First four are empty, fifth is X. Fifth row: All X's again. \n\nWait, let me double-check. The first row is all X's. Second row has four empty and one X. Third row has two empty, then three X's. Fourth row same as the second. Fifth row all X's. So the pattern is symmetric vertically? Let me see. The first and fifth rows are the same. The second and fourth rows are the same. The third row is the middle one. So maybe it's a diamond shape? The X's form a diamond in the center, with the outer rows being all X's. Hmm, but the second and fourth rows have a single X on the right. Wait, maybe it's a cross? No, the middle row has three X's. Let me visualize it again.\n\nRow 1: X X X X X  \nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X  \nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X X X",
