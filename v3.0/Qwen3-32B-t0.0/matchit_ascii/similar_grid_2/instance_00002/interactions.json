The other rows have two X's, then a ▢, then two X's again. Wait, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 have the same pattern: X X ▢ X X. The third row is all X's. So the ▢ symbols are in positions (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3). That's the third column, except for the third row. So the third column has ▢ in rows 1,2,4,5 and X in row 3. The rest of the columns are all X's. So the grid is symmetric vertically? Let me check. If you look at columns 1 and 5, they're all X's. Columns 2 and 4 are also all X's. Column 3 has the ▢s except the middle row. So the grid is",
