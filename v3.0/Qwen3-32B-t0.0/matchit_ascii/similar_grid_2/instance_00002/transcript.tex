	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe my grid first. The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid with some X's and ▢ symbols. Let me look at it again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 2: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 3: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 4: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 5: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt \\ \tt So, each row is five elements. The third row is all X's. The other rows have two X's, then a ▢, then two X's again. Wait, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 have the same pattern: X X ▢ X X. The third row is all X's. So the ▢ symbols are in positions (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3). That's the third column, except for the third row. So the third column has ▢ in rows 1,2,4,5 and X in row 3. The rest of the columns are all X's. So the grid is symmetric vertically? Let me check. If you look at columns 1 and 5, they're all X's. Columns 2 and 4 are also all X's. Column 3 has the ▢s except the middle row. So the grid is
