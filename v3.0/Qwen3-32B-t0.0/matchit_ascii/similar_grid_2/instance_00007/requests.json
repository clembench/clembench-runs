The grid is 5x5, right? Let me check the layout again. The first row is X, then three boxes, then X. So positions (1,1) and (1,5) are X. The second row has X at (2,2) and (2,4). The third, fourth, and fifth rows all have an X in the third column, so (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). The rest are empty boxes.\n\nHmm, I need to make sure I describe this accurately. Maybe mention the rows and columns where the Xs are. Let me count again. First row: X at 1 and 5. Second row: X at 2 and 4. Then rows 3-5 have X in the middle column (3). So the Xs form a sort of cross in the middle and two Xs on the top and bottom of the first and fifth columns. Wait, no, the first row's Xs are in the first and fifth columns. The second row's Xs are in the second and fourth. Then the middle column has Xs from row 3 to 5. So maybe it's like a vertical line in the middle and a horizontal line across the top and bottom? Not sure if that's the right way to visualize it. But the key is to list the",
