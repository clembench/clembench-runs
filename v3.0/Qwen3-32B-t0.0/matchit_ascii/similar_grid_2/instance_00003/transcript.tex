	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

Let me count the X's in each row.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. So two X's at the start and end. Second row: ▢, X, ▢, X, ▢. That's two X's in the middle positions. Third row: ▢, ▢, X, ▢, ▢. Only the center is X. Fourth row is the same as the second, and fifth the same as the first. So it's symmetrical vertically and horizontally. The X's form a sort of cross in the center? Wait, no. Let me visualize it again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: positions 1 and 5 are X. Row 2: positions 2 and 4. Row 3: position 3. Then rows 4 and 5 mirror rows 2 and 1. So the X's form a diamond shape? Like a plus sign rotated 45 degrees. The center is X, and each diagonal has X's. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, it's like a star pattern. But the exact positions are important. Let me make sure I describe it accurately. The user will compare it to their own grid, so I need to be
