The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ R ▢ ▢ R\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid is 5x5. Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has R's and empty squares. I need to identify where the R's are located.\n\nFirst row: the third column has an R. So that's (1,3). Second row has an R in the second column, so (2,2). Fourth row has R's in the second and fifth columns, which are (4,2) and (4,5). The rest are empty. \n\nThe example steps they gave used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So for each R, I should issue a command to place an R in the respective positions. Since there are multiple R's in the fourth row, maybe I can combine those into one command. Let me check the rules again. The user said a command can refer to multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. So for the fourth row, I can say \"Put R in fourth row second column and fourth row fifth column\". Or maybe \"Put R in (4,2) and (4,5)\". Alternatively, since they are in the same row, maybe \"Put R in fourth row at columns 2 and 5\". But the example used specific positions, so maybe it",
