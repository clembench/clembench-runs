The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\n▢ T ▢ T ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ T ▢ ▢ T\nWhat is your next command?",

My task is to describe the placement of these letters step by step, one command at a time, until all are described, then say DONE.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grid and note where the letters are. Let me visualize the grid again:\n\nRow 1: all empty (▢)\nRow 2: ends with a T in the fifth column\nRow 3: has a T in the second column, another in the fourth column\nRow 4: all empty\nRow 5: has a T in the second column and another in the fifth column\n\nSo the letters are in positions (2,5), (3,2), (3,4), (5,2), (5,5). \n\nNow, the example given in the problem used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So each command should specify the action (put a letter) and the location. Since the user wants only one command per turn, I need to handle each letter placement one by one or maybe group them if they are in the same row or column. But the example filled the entire last row with X, so if multiple letters are in the same row or column, that might be a way to combine commands. However, in this case, the Ts are spread out. Let's",
