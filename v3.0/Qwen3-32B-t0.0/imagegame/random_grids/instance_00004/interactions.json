You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nR ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ R R ▢\n▢ R ▢ R ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has R's and empty squares. I need to figure out the positions of all the R's and then come up with commands to place them one by one.\n\nFirst, I'll go row by row. The first row has R in the first and fifth columns. So that's (1,1) and (1,5). The second row has an R in the first column. Third row is all empty. Fourth row has R's in third and fourth columns, so (4,3) and (4,4). Fifth row has R in the second and fourth columns, which are (5,2) and (5,4).\n\nNow, the example steps used commands like \"Put an R in first row first column\" and similar. The user wants each command to be one at a time, but can refer to multiple cells if needed. However, in the example given, they first placed an E in a single cell, then filled the last row with X's. So maybe for multiple same letters in a row or column, it's better to use a more efficient command.\n\nLooking at the first row: two R's. Maybe I can say \"Put R's in first row first and fifth columns.\" But the example used",
