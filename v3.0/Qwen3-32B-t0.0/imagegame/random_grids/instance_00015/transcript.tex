	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ W ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ W ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid with some W's and empty squares. My job is to describe the placement of the letters step by step, one command at a time. The example they gave used commands like putting an E in a specific position and filling a row with X's. So I need to follow that pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the grid they provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ W ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: W ▢ W ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt So the letters are W's. Let me note their positions. \\ \tt \\ \tt In row 1, there's a W in column 2. Then in row 3, there's a W in column 1 and column 3. Rows 4 and 5 each have a W in column 1. Row 2 has no letters. \\ \tt \\ \tt The first step would be to place the W in row 1, column 2. Then handle the Ws in row 3. Maybe do row 3 first? Wait, the example started with the E in the second row third column, then filled the last row. So maybe process row by row, left to right?\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: column
