The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B B B\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ B ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user provided a 5x5 grid with some B's placed. My task is to describe the grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The example they gave used commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a row with X's. So I need to follow that pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grid they provided. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: all empty (▢)\nRow 2: columns 3, 4, 5 have B's (so positions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5))\nRow 3: column 3 has a B (position (3,3))\nRow 4: column 4 has a B (position (4,4))\nRow 5: all empty\n\nSo the letters are in specific cells. The example steps first mentioned putting an E in the second row third column, then filling the last row with X. So for this grid, I need to issue commands for each B placement.\n\nBut wait, the user's example had multiple B's in row 2. How to handle that? The example used \"Put an E in second row third column\" for a single cell. For multiple cells in the same row, maybe I can say \"Fill the third to fifth columns of the second row with B\". That would cover the three B's in row 2. Then, the B",
