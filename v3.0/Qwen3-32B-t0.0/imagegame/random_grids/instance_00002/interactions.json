You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ I ▢\nI ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nI ▢ I I I\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ I\nWhat is your next command?",

The user wants me to only mention the letters and not the empty squares. Let me start by looking at each row and column.\n\nFirst row: The first row has an \"I\" in the fourth column. So the first command should be to put an I there. That's row 1, column 4.\n\nSecond row: The second row starts with an \"I\" in the first column. So next command is putting an I in row 2, column 1.\n\nThird row: The third row has an \"I\" in the fifth column. So command for row 3, column 5.\n\nFourth row: This row has \"I\" in the first, third, fourth, and fifth columns. Wait, looking at the grid, the fourth row is I ▢ I I I. So columns 1, 3, 4, 5. So maybe first put the I in column 1, then handle columns 3-5. But the user allows commands to refer to multiple cells. So maybe \"Fill row 4 with I except column 2\". But the example used \"Fill the last row with X\". Alternatively, since columns 3-5 are all I, maybe \"Put I in row 4, columns 3 to 5\" and then \"Put I in row 4,",
