You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ Q Q ▢ ▢\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\n▢ ▢ Q ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ Q ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has Qs and empty squares. I need to figure out the positions of all the Qs.\n\nFirst, I'll go row by row. The first row has a Q in the first column, and the rest are empty. So the first command should be to put a Q in row 1, column 1.\n\nNext, the second row has Qs in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the next command is to put Qs in row 2, columns 2 and 3. But the user's example used \"Put an E in second row third column\" for a single cell. Since the user allows commands to refer to multiple cells, I can mention both columns here.\n\nThird row has Qs in column 1 and 5. So command for row 3, columns 1 and 5.\n\nFourth row has a Q in column 3. So row 4, column 3.\n\nFifth row has a Q in column 4. So row 5, column 4.\n\nI need to make sure each command is one at a time. Let me check the order. Starting with the first row, then second, third, fourth, fifth. Each command should specify the row and columns where",
