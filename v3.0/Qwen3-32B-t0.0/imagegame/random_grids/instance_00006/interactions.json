You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nM ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nM ▢ ▢ M ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n▢ M ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has Ms and some empty squares. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the positions where there's a letter. Let me go row by row.\n\nFirst row: M in the first column, the rest are empty. So command would be to put an M in row 1, column 1.\n\nSecond row: M in first column and another M in fourth column. So two commands here? Wait, but the example they gave for the E and X used separate commands. But the user said \"you can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells...\" So maybe I can combine putting Ms in the same row if possible. But in the example, they did separate commands for E and then filling the row with X. Hmm. Wait, in the example, the second command was \"Fill the last row with X\" which refers to multiple cells. So maybe for the same row, if there are multiple letters, I can mention them in one command. Let me check the example again. The example had an E in second row third column, then fill last row with X. So each command is either a single cell or a whole row/column/grid. \n\nIn the second row here, there are Ms in",
