The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ K ▢\n▢ ▢ K ▢ K\n▢ ▢ ▢ K ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ K ▢ K K\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to describe the positions of the letters in the given 5x5 grid step by step. The user wants me to only mention the letters and not the empty squares. The example they provided first had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X's. So I should follow a similar approach here.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ K ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ K ▢ K\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ K ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ K ▢ K K\n\nFirst, I'll check each row for letters. Starting with Row 1. There's a K in the fourth column. So the first command should be to put a K in row 1, column 4.\n\nNext, Row 2 has K's in column 3 and column 5. So maybe I can handle both in one command. Like putting a K in row 2, columns 3 and 5. Wait, but the example used separate commands for each action. Wait, the example had two commands: one for the E and one for the last row. But the user said that each command can refer to multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. So maybe I can combine the two K's in row",
