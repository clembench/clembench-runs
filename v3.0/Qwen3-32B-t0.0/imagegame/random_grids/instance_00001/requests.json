You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ F F\n▢ F ▢ ▢ F\nF ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid is 5x5. Let me look at the example they provided. In their example, the filled grid had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X. The commands were specific to those positions.\n\nNow, looking at the current grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: all empty\nRow 2: all empty\nRow 3: third and fourth columns are F, fifth is F\nRow 4: second column is F, fifth is F\nRow 5: first column is F\n\nSo I need to figure out the best way to describe placing the F's. Let me start by checking each row and column for patterns.\n\nRow 3 has F's in columns 3, 4, 5. That's three in a row. Maybe I can say \"Put F in row 3, columns 3 to 5\". But the user's example used specific commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So they prefer either individual cell commands or filling entire rows/columns if possible.\n\nLooking at row 4: F in column 2 and 5. Not a continuous block, so maybe individual commands. Similarly, row 5 has F in column 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a diagonal or",
