The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ Y Y ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ Y ▢\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Y\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided.\n\nFirst, the example grid has Ys and a Y in specific positions. Let me map out where each letter is.\n\nLooking at the first row: ▢ ▢ Y Y ▢. So positions (1,3) and (1,4) are Y.\n\nSecond row: ▢ ▢ ▢ Y ▢. That's (2,4) as Y.\n\nThird row: ▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢. So (3,3) is Y.\n\nFourth row is all empty except maybe the fifth row. Fifth row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ Y. So (5,5) is Y.\n\nSo the letters are at (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), and (5,5). \n\nNow, the user's example steps first mentioned putting an E in a specific cell, then filling a row. So I need to follow that pattern. Each command should be a single action. Let me start with the first Y in the first row, third column. \n\nFirst command: Put a Y in first row third column. Then next, the adjacent Y in first row fourth column. Then the Y in second row fourth column, then third",
