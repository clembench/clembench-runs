The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ N ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ N ▢ ▢ N\n▢ N N N ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ N N N ▢\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user provided a 5x5 grid with some letters filled in. My task is to describe the positions of the letters step by step, one command at a time. The example they gave used commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a row with Xs. So I need to follow that pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: ▢ N ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ N ▢ ▢ N\nRow 3: ▢ N N N ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ N N N ▢\n\nI need to note all the positions where there are letters (N in this case) and figure out the best way to describe them. The user's example used specific cell references and sometimes entire rows or columns. Since the user wants only one command per step, I should break down the placements into individual commands.\n\nLooking at Row 1: There's an N in column 2. So the first command would be to put an N in row 1, column 2.\n\nNext, Row 2 has N in column 2 and another in column 5. So maybe first handle column 2, then column 5. But the example in the user's message put the E first, then filled the row. But here, since",
