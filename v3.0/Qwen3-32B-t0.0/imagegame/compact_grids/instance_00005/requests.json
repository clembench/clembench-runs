The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW W W W W\nWhat is your next command?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The example they gave had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X's. So I need to follow a similar approach here.\n\nLooking at the provided grid:\n\nRow 1: W, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢\nRow 2: W, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢\nRow 3: W, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢\nRow 4: W, ▢, ▢, ▢, ▢\nRow 5: W, W, W, W, W\n\nFirst, I notice that the first column (column 1) from row 1 to row 4 has W's. Then the fifth row is entirely filled with W's. The example steps first mentioned a specific cell, then a whole row. So maybe I should start by addressing the first column. But wait, the first column has four W's. Should I mention each one individually or the entire column? The example used \"Put an E in second row third column\" for a single cell and \"Fill the last row with X\" for a whole row. So for multiple cells in a column, maybe I can say \"Fill the first column with W from row 1 to row 4\". But the user's example",
