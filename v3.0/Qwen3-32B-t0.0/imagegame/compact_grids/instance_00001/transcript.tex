	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt F F F F F\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt F F F F F\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid with some F's and empty squares. My task is to describe the grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The example they gave used commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a row with X's. So I need to follow that pattern.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, looking at the grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: all empty\\ \tt Row 2: all F's\\ \tt Row 3: all empty\\ \tt Row 4: all F's\\ \tt Row 5: all empty\\ \tt \\ \tt So the letters are in rows 2 and 4, all columns. Since each of those rows is completely filled with F's, the command should be to fill those rows. The example used "Fill the last row with X" for a single row. Here, there are two rows (row 2 and row 4) that need to be filled with F's. But the user's example only had one command per step. So I need to do each row one at a time.\\ \tt \\ \tt First command: Fill the second row with F's. Then the next command would be to fill the fourth row with F's. After that, there are no more letters, so DONE.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user's example had "Fill the last row with X" as a command. In this case, rows 2 and 4 are the ones with F's. So the commands would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt First
