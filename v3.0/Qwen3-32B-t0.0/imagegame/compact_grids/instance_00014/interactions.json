The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nB ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ B ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ B ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ B\nWhat is your next command?",

The first row has B in column 1, the second row in column 2, and so on until the fifth row with B in column 5. All other cells are empty (▢). My task is to describe the placement of the letters step by step, only mentioning the non-empty cells.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the most efficient way to describe each B's position. Since they're all on the main diagonal, maybe there's a pattern. But the user's example used specific commands for each element and then a command to fill a row. However, in this case, each B is in a different row and column. \n\nThe example given had two commands: one for placing an E in a specific cell and another for filling an entire row with X. So, for this grid, I could either specify each B individually or find a pattern. But the user's example used individual commands for each non-empty cell except the last row which was filled all at once. \n\nLooking at the grid, each B is in row i, column i for i from 1 to 5. So, the first B is at (1,1), then (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). The user's example used \"Put an E in second row third column\" for",
