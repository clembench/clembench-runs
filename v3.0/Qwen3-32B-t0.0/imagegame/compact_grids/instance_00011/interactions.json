You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nU U U U U\n▢ ▢ U ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ U ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ U ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ U ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has U's in the first row all the way across, and then in the third column of rows 2 through 5, there's a U each. So the first thing I notice is the first row is all U's. The example they gave for commands started with putting an E in a specific cell, then filling the last row with X's. So following that pattern, maybe I should first handle the entire first row.\n\nIn the example, when they had the first row as all U's, the correct command would be to fill the first row with U's. Let me check the user's example again. The example grid they showed had the first row as U U U U U, so that's the entire row. So the first command should be \"Fill the first row with U\". Then, looking at the other U's, they are in the third column of rows 2 to 5. So the next step would be to put U's in those positions. Since it's the same column across multiple rows, maybe the command is \"Put a U in the third column of the second, third, fourth, and fifth rows\". But the user's example used \"Fill the last row with X\", so maybe for",
