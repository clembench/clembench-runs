The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nY Y Y Y Y\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

My task is to describe the placement of the letters step by step, only mentioning the non-empty cells. The example they gave first had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X's. So I need to follow a similar approach here.\n\nLooking at the given grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nRow 3: Y Y Y Y Y\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ Y ▢ ▢\n\nFirst, I notice that the third column (column 3) has Y's in rows 1, 2, 4, and 5. But row 3's entire row is filled with Y's. So maybe start by placing the Y's in the third column first, but wait, row 3 already has Y's in all columns. Alternatively, maybe start with the third row since it's completely filled. But the example started with a specific cell, then a row. Let me think.\n\nThe example first mentioned a single cell (E in second row third column), then filled the last row. So perhaps the best approach is to first handle the third row, which is entirely Y's. That would be a row command",
