The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ D\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ D\nD D D D D\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ D\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ D\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has D's in certain positions. \n\nFirst, I need to identify all the cells that have a letter. The empty cells are denoted by ▢, so I can ignore those. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: D, ▢, ▢, ▢, D. So positions (1,1) and (1,5) are D.\n\nRow 2: D, ▢, ▢, ▢, D. Similarly, (2,1) and (2,5) are D.\n\nRow 3: All D's. So positions (3,1) to (3,5) are D.\n\nRow 4: D, ▢, ▢, ▢, D. Positions (4,1) and (4,5) are D.\n\nRow 5: D, ▢, ▢, ▢, D. Positions (5,1) and (5,5) are D.\n\nSo the pattern here is that the first and fifth columns are all D's. Additionally, the third row is entirely D's. \n\nNow, the user's example steps used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last",
