You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid is 5x5. Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has R's and empty squares. I need to figure out the positions of all the R's.\n\nFirst, I'll go row by row. The first row has an R in the first column. So that's (1,1). The second row has R's in the second and fifth columns, so (2,2) and (2,5). Third row has an R in the third column, (3,3). Fourth row has R's in the first and fourth columns, (4,1) and (4,4). Fifth row has R's in the second and fifth columns, (5,2) and (5,5). \n\nNow, I need to come up with commands to place each of these R's. The example they gave used specific commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So each command should be about placing a letter in a specific location. Since there are multiple R's, I can do them one by one. \n\nI should start with the first R in (1,1). Then move to the next ones in order. Maybe group them if possible, but since they're spread out, probably each R needs a separate command",
