You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid is 5x5. Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has K's in the first row, all five columns. Then in the second row, the last column is K. Third row has K's in columns 2, 3, and 5. Fourth row has K's in columns 2 and 5. Fifth row has K's in columns 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, the example given by the user is:\n\nK K K K K\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K K ▢ K\n▢ K ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K K K K\n\nSo I need to describe each letter's position. Let me start with the first row. All five are K's. The example in the problem statement had the first command as putting an E in a specific cell, then filling the last row. So for this grid, the first step could be filling the first row with K's. Then, the second row has a K in the fifth column. Third row has K's in columns 2, 3, and 5. Fourth row has K's in columns 2 and 5. Fifth row has K's from column 2 to 5. \n\nWait, the user's example steps for",
