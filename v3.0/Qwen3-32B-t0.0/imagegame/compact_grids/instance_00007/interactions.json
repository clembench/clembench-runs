You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nT T T T T\n▢ T T T T\n▢ ▢ T T T\n▢ ▢ ▢ T T\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\nWhat is your next command?",

The example given had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X. The current grid is a 5x5 with Ts in a diagonal pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row and see where the Ts are. The first row is all Ts. But the user said not to describe empty squares, so maybe I should focus on the letters. Wait, the example had the first row as empty except for the E and X, but in this case, the first row is all Ts. So the command would be to fill the first row with T. That's the first step.\n\nNext, the second row starts with a ▢, then T, T, T, T. So the first cell is empty, but the rest are Ts. So the command here would be to put a T in the second row, second column. Wait, but the second row already has Ts from column 2 to 5. But the first cell is empty. But the user's instruction is to only describe the letters. So maybe the second row's Ts are in columns 2-5. So the command would be to fill the second row from column 2 to 5 with T. But the example used \"Put an E in second row third column\" for a single cell. So maybe for multiple",
