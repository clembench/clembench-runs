The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nI ▢ I ▢ I\n▢ I ▢ I ▢\nI ▢ I ▢ I\n▢ I ▢ I ▢\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nWhat is your next command?",

The example they gave used commands like putting an E in a specific position and filling a row with X's. So I need to do the same here.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where all the I's are. Let me look at the grid again:\n\nRow 1: I, ▢, I, ▢, I\nRow 2: ▢, I, ▢, I, ▢\nRow 3: I, ▢, I, ▢, I\nRow 4: ▢, I, ▢, I, ▢\nRow 5: I, ▢, I, ▢, I\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that in odd-numbered rows (1,3,5), the I's are in columns 1, 3, 5. In even-numbered rows (2,4), the I's are in columns 2 and 4. \n\nI need to describe each I's position. The first step could be to place I's in the first row. The first row has I's in columns 1, 3, 5. So maybe the first command is to put I's in those positions. But the example used \"Put an E in",
