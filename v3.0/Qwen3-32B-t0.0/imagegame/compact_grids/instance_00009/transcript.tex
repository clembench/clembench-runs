	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid where every other cell in each row has an "I". The pattern looks like I, empty, I, empty, I in the first row, and similarly for the others. The task is to describe the grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions, using commands like "Put an X in row 2 column 3" or "Fill the last row with X", and then end with "DONE".\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out the positions of all the "I"s. Let's start with the first row. The first row has "I" in columns 1, 3, and 5. So the command would be to put an I in those positions. But the example given in the problem used "Put an E in second row third column" for a single cell. However, the user's example shows that if multiple cells in a row follow a pattern, maybe we can describe them more efficiently. But the instructions say that each command can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. So maybe there's a way to describe the entire first row's pattern in one command.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the first row is I ▢ I ▢ I. So columns 1, 3, 5. Similarly, the second row is I ▢ I ▢ I. Same for all rows. So every row has I in
