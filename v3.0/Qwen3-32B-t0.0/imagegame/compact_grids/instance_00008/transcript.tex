	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt Z ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\\ \tt ▢ Z ▢ Z ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ Z ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ Z ▢ Z ▢\\ \tt Z ▢ ▢ ▢ Z\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe the given 5x5 grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The example they provided first had an E in the second row third column and the last row filled with X's. The commands were specific to those elements.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: Z, ▢, ▢, ▢, Z\\ \tt Row 2: ▢, Z, ▢, Z, ▢\\ \tt Row 3: ▢, ▢, Z, ▢, ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢, Z, ▢, Z, ▢\\ \tt Row 5: Z, ▢, ▢, ▢, Z\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to identify all the positions where there are letters (Z in this case). Let's go row by row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1 has Z in column 1 and column 5.\\ \tt Row 2 has Z in column 2 and column 4.\\ \tt Row 3 has Z in column 3.\\ \tt Row 4 has Z in column 2 and column 4.\\ \tt Row 5 has Z in column 1 and column 5.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the letters are placed symmetrically. The first step could be to place Zs in the first row's first and fifth columns. Then proceed to the next rows. But the user wants one command at a time, each step. The example used "Put
