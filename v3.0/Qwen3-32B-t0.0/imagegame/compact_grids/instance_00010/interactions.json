You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nQ Q ▢ Q Q\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\nQ Q ▢ Q Q\nWhat is your next command?",

Let me look at the example they provided. The filled grid has Qs and empty squares. I need to figure out the positions of all the Qs and then give commands to place them one by one.\n\nFirst, I'll go row by row. The first row is Q Q ▢ Q Q. So positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) have Qs. The second row is Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q, so (2,1) and (2,5). Third row is all empty. Fourth row: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q, same as the second row. Fifth row: Q Q ▢ Q Q, same as the first row.\n\nNow, the example steps they gave used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So for each Q, I need to specify their positions. But maybe there's a pattern here. The first, second, fourth, and fifth rows have Qs in the first, second, fourth, and fifth columns. The third row is all empty. So maybe I can group the commands by rows or columns.\n\nBut the user said to give one command at a time, which can refer to multiple",
