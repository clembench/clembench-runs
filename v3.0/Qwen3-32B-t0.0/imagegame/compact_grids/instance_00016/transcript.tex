	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt N N N N N\\ \tt N ▢ ▢ ▢ N\\ \tt N ▢ N ▢ N\\ \tt N ▢ ▢ ▢ N\\ \tt N N N N N\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe the filled grid step by step, only mentioning the letters and their positions. The grid given is 5x5. Let me look at the example they provided. In their example, they first placed an E in the second row third column, then filled the last row with Xs, and then done.\\ \tt \\ \tt So for the current grid, I need to identify all the letters and their positions. The grid here has Ns and some empty squares (▢). Let me map it out.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: All Ns. So N N N N N. But the user said not to describe empty squares. Wait, but the first row is all Ns, so maybe I need to mention that. But in the example, when the last row was all Xs, they said "Fill the last row with X". So maybe for the first row, I can say "Fill the first row with N".\\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: N, then three empty, then N. So positions (2,1) is N and (2,5) is N. But maybe it's better to mention each N individually? Or see if there's a pattern. But since the rest are empty, maybe just mention the Ns in the second row. So "Put an N in second row first column" and "Put an N in second row fifth column".\\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: N, then two empty, then N, then empty
