This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

The user wants me to guess a five-letter word. I need to pick a common one to maximize the chances of getting useful feedback. Words like \"apple\" or \"crane\" are often recommended because they have a mix of vowels and consonants. Let me go with \"crane\" as the first guess. It has two vowels (a and e) and three consonants (c, r, n), which should help narrow down possibilities. The explanation should mention that it's a common word with a good mix of letters. Alright, that's the first step.\n</think>\n\nexplanation: \"crane\" is a common five-letter word with a mix of vowels and consonants, providing a broad initial check for possible letters in the target word.\nguess: crane<|im_end|>",
