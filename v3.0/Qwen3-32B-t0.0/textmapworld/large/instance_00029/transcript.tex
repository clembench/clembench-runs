	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Attic. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Attic, the only direction available is west. So I should go west first. Let me note that down.\\ \tt \\ \tt After moving west, I'll enter a new room. Let's say that's Room A. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose Room A has directions like north, east, and south. But since I came from the Attic (which is west of Room A), the opposite direction would be east. So if I go north or south next, I might explore new areas. But I need to make sure I don't get stuck in a loop. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, where I go as far as possible before backtracking. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the goal is to minimize the number of room changes. So maybe I should prioritize directions that haven't been taken yet. Each time I enter a room, I should check which directions lead to unvisited rooms. If there's only one unvisited direction, go that way. If none, then backtrack. But how do I know which rooms have been visited? The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe once all possible rooms are visited, I can stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt But the example shows that when you can't go further, you say DONE. So in the example, when in the Bedroom with only
