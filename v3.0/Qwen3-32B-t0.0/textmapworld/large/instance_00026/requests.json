In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Nursery, the only direction available is south. So I should go south first. Let me note that down.\n\nAfter moving south, I enter a new room. Let's say that's the next room. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose it's the Living Room, and the available directions are north, east, and west. Wait, but I came from the north (since I went south from the Nursery), so north would take me back. But I need to visit all rooms, so maybe I should go east or west. But how do I know which one leads to unvisited rooms? Hmm. Since I don't have a map, I have to track which rooms I've already been to. Let's assume I keep track mentally. So if I go east, maybe that leads to another room, like the Dining Room. Then from there, maybe I can go further. But if I hit a dead end, I might have to backtrack. The key is to minimize the number of times I change direction. So maybe a depth-first approach would work here, exploring as far as possible before backtracking.\n\nWait, but the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So once all rooms are visited, I should say DONE. Let me try to simulate this step by step. Starting in",
