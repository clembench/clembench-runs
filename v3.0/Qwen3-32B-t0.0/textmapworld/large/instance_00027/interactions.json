In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?",

The example they gave used a simple path, but I need to make sure I cover all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nFirst, I should probably pick a direction and stick with it as long as possible. Let's say I go east first. If there's a room there that leads to more unvisited rooms, that's good. But if not, maybe I need to backtrack. Wait, but the goal is to minimize room changes. So maybe a depth-first approach would be better here. Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking.\n\nBut how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, I have to make decisions based on the available directions each time. Let's start with the first move. From the Living room, directions are west and east. Let's choose east first. Then, in the next room, check the available directions. If there's only one direction, go that way. If there are multiple, pick one that hasn't been explored yet. But since I don't have a record of visited rooms, maybe I need to track that mentally. Wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So each time I enter a room, I need to remember if it's new or",
