	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Bedroom, directions are west and east. Hmm. The example ended with entering a Bedroom and then doing DONE, but that might have been a dead end. Wait, in the example, after entering the Bedroom, there was only south, so they stopped. But here, there are two directions: west and east. So maybe I should choose one direction first, explore as much as possible, then backtrack if needed.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I know which direction leads to more rooms? Since I don't have a map, I have to make decisions based on the available directions. Let's think of this as a graph traversal problem. The goal is to visit all nodes (rooms) with the least number of moves. The optimal strategy would be something like a depth-first search, where you go as deep as possible before backtracking. But since I can't mark visited rooms, maybe I need to keep track mentally.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user is providing the current room and available directions each time. So each step, I have to decide which direction to go next. The challenge is to minimize the number of steps (room changes) while ensuring all rooms are visited. If I go in a direction that leads to unvisited rooms, that's good. If I go back to a room I've already been in, that's a waste.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the
