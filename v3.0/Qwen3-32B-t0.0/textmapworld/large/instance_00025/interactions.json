In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably pick one direction first. Maybe go north first. Let's try that.\n\nSo, GO: north. Now, where does that take me? Suppose it's a different room. Then I need to check the available directions there. But wait, I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Maybe I should use a systematic approach, like depth-first search. Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But how do I know if I've covered all rooms? Each time I enter a new room, I should note the directions and decide the next move. If a room only has one direction, that's probably the way to go. If there are multiple, maybe pick one and mark the others to backtrack later. Once I can't go anywhere new, then I can say DONE. Let's start moving.\n</think>\n\nGO: north\nYou have made a step and entered a Dining Room. Currently available directions: south, east.
