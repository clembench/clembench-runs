	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Cellar, which has an east direction. So first, I should go east. That would take me to the next room. Let's say that's the Hallway. Now, from the Hallway, I need to check which directions are available. If there are multiple directions, I should choose the one that leads to unvisited rooms. But since I don't know the layout yet, maybe I should explore one direction first and backtrack if needed. Wait, but the goal is to minimize room changes. Hmm. Maybe a depth-first approach would work here, visiting as far as possible before backtracking. Let's try that.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, starting in Cellar, go east to Hallway. Now, Hallway's directions might be north, south, east, west. Suppose I go north next. If that leads to a room with only one direction, I proceed. If I hit a dead end, I need to backtrack. But how do I know when all rooms are visited? Maybe I need to keep track of visited rooms. Since the user doesn't provide the full map, I have to assume based on the directions given each step. Let's proceed step by step, always choosing a direction that hasn't been taken yet. If I end up in a room where all directions lead back to already visited rooms, then I check if
