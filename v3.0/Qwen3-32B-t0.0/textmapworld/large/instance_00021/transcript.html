        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Gallery. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Gallery, and the only direction available is east. So the first move should be east. Let me think about what comes next.<br/><br/>After moving east, they&#x27;ll enter a new room. Let&#x27;s say that room has multiple directions. I need to track which rooms have been visited already. If a room only has one direction, like the example&#x27;s Bedroom, then after moving there, there&#x27;s no other direction except back, so you stop. But if there are multiple directions, I should choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms first.<br/><br/>Wait, but how do I know which rooms are connected? The problem doesn&#x27;t give a map, so I have to assume that each move is to a new room unless there&#x27;s no other option. Maybe it&#x27;s a tree structure where each room branches out, and I need to traverse it in a way that minimizes backtracking. Like a depth-first search, where you go as far as possible before backtracking.<br/><br/>So starting in the Gallery, moving east. Let&#x27;s imagine the next room has directions, say, north and west. If west is the direction back to Gallery, then choosing north would be better. But since the user doesn&#x27;t have a map, I have to make decisions based on the available directions each time. If a room has only one direction, it&#x27;s a dead end</p>
