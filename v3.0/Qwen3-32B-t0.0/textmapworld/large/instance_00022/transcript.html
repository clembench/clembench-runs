        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Recreation room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Recreation room and can go east. The example shows that when there&#x27;s only one direction, you take it, and when you can&#x27;t go further, you go back. But how do I know if there are more rooms to visit?<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I should use a depth-first search approach. That way, I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. So starting in the Recreation room, the only direction is east. Let&#x27;s go east first. Then, from the next room, I&#x27;ll check the available directions. If there&#x27;s more than one, I pick one and mark the others to backtrack later. But since the user can&#x27;t remember visited rooms, maybe I need to track that somehow. Wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe the system keeps track of visited rooms automatically. <br/><br/>Wait, the user&#x27;s instructions don&#x27;t mention knowing which rooms have been visited. So maybe the system handles that. So when I enter a room, it&#x27;s considered visited. So the strategy is to always go in a direction that leads to an unvisited room if possible. If all directions lead to visited rooms, then backtrack. But how do I know which direction to take? Since the user can&#x27;t see the map, I have to make decisions based on the available directions each time</p>
