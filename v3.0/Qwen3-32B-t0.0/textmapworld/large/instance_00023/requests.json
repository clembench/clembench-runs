In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Media room and can go north. The example shows that when there's only one direction, they went that way, then when they got stuck, they did DONE. But maybe there's a better way if there are more rooms.\n\nWait, the problem is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. So I need to make sure that each move leads to a new room and that I don't miss any. But how do I know the layout? The user only gives the current room and available directions each time. So I have to make decisions based on that, without knowing the full map.\n\nIn the example, starting in the Kitchen, they went west to Lobby, then north to Bedroom, then south back to Lobby, then east back to Kitchen. Then they did DONE. But that's because they had already visited all rooms. So the key is to track which rooms have been visited and choose directions that lead to unvisited ones first.\n\nBut the user isn't providing a list of visited rooms. So maybe the assistant has to keep track internally. Wait, but in the problem statement, the assistant is supposed to decide the direction each time, so it must be maintaining state. But in the example, the assistant just gives \"GO\" or \"DONE\" without any other text. So the assistant must be using some strategy",
