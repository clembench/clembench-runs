        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Bar. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;think&gt;<br/>Okay, let&#x27;s see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Bar, the only direction available is west. So I should go west first. Let me note that down.<br/><br/>After moving west, I enter a new room. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose it&#x27;s a different room, maybe a Hall or something. The key is to keep track of which rooms I&#x27;ve already visited so I don&#x27;t go back unnecessarily. Since I came from the Bar, I should avoid going back east unless there&#x27;s no other option. <br/><br/>If the next room has multiple directions, I should prioritize directions that lead to unvisited rooms. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, I need to make sure each move is to a new room. If I ever find myself in a room where all available directions lead to already visited rooms, then I can stop. <br/><br/>Wait, the example ends when there&#x27;s only one direction left (south in the Bedroom), and then they do DONE. So maybe once you&#x27;re in a room where all directions lead back to visited rooms, you can&#x27;t proceed further, so you stop. But how do I know if all rooms have been visited? Since I don&#x27;t have a map, I have to assume that once I can&#x27;t move to any new rooms,</p>
