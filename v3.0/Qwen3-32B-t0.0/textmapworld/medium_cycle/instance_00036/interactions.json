In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?",

So I should go south first. Let me note that down.\n\nAfter moving south, I enter a new room. Let's say that's the next room. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose it's the Dining Room with directions east and north. Hmm, I need to decide which direction to take next. If I go east, maybe that leads to another room, but I should consider if that's the most efficient path. Alternatively, going north might lead to a different area. Wait, but I don't know the layout yet. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, I should try to explore as much as possible in each direction before backtracking. Maybe a depth-first approach would work here. Let me try going east first. If that leads to a dead end, I can backtrack and try another direction. \n\nBut wait, the example given uses a simple path and ends when there's only one direction left. So maybe the key is to always choose a direction that hasn't been visited yet. However, without knowing the room names or the connections, it's a bit tricky. The user is providing the available directions each time, so I need to make decisions based on the current state. \n\nIn the Pantry, moving south takes me to another",
