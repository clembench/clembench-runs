In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Playroom, the only direction available is north. So I should go north first. Let me note that down.\n\nAfter moving north, I'll be in the next room. Let's say that's the Library. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose the Library has directions like east and south. If I go east, maybe that leads to another room, but I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Wait, the key is to minimize the number of direction changes. So maybe a depth-first approach would work here, where I keep going as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I also need to track which rooms I've already visited to avoid revisiting them unnecessarily.\n\nWait, but the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So I need to keep track of all rooms visited. Let me think. Each time I enter a room, I should check if all connected rooms have been visited. If not, choose a direction that leads to an unvisited room. If all directions lead to already visited rooms, then that's the end. But how do I know which rooms are unvisited? Since the user is providing the available directions each time, maybe I can keep a mental map of the rooms I've been to and their connections.\n\nStarting in the Playroom",
