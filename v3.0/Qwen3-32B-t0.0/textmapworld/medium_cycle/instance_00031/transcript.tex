	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Sauna, the only direction available is west. So first, I should go west. Let's assume that leads to another room. Now, depending on what's next, I need to keep track of which rooms I've already been to. If I go west, maybe I enter a different room, like a Bathroom or something. Then, from there, I need to check the available directions again. The key is to avoid revisiting rooms once they've been explored. If I ever find myself in a situation where all the directions lead back to rooms I've already been in, then I should stop with "DONE". But since the example ended when there was only one direction left (south) and going there led to a dead end, maybe I need to backtrack. Wait, but how do I know which path to take? Maybe I should use a depth-first search approach, always going in a direction that hasn't been visited yet. But since I don't have the full map, I have to make decisions based on the current room's available directions. Let me try to outline the steps:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Start in Sauna, go west. Let's say that's the first move.\\ \tt 2. From the next room, check available directions. Suppose it's a Hallway with directions north, east, and south. I need to pick
