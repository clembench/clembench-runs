In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Utility room and can go east. The example shows that when there's only one direction left, they use DONE. So maybe the key is to traverse each room once, making sure not to get stuck in a loop.\n\nStarting in the Utility room, the only direction is east. So the first move should be east. Let's say that takes them to another room. Then, depending on the available directions there, they need to choose a direction that hasn't been visited yet. If there are multiple options, maybe pick one that leads to more unvisited rooms. But since the user can't see the map, I have to assume that each move is part of a path that eventually covers all rooms.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the user doesn't know the layout. So the strategy must be to always go in a direction that hasn't been taken yet. If all directions from the current room have been tried, then maybe backtrack. But how to track visited rooms? The user can't remember, so the system must infer based on the directions given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rooms form a tree structure, and the optimal path is a depth-first traversal. So go as far as possible in one direction, then backtrack. But without knowing the structure, it's tricky. The example ends when there's only one direction left, which",
