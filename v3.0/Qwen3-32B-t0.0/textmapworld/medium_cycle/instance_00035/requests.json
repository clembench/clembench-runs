In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n",

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Guest room and can go north. The example shows that when there's only one direction left, they use DONE. So maybe I should follow a path that covers all rooms without backtracking.\n\nStarting in the Guest room, going north. Let's assume that each move leads to a new room. But I don't know the layout. The key is to make sure that each move is necessary and that I don't get stuck in a loop. If after moving, the next room has multiple directions, I need to choose the one that leads to unvisited rooms. But since I don't have a map, I have to rely on the available directions given each time.\n\nWait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So once all possible rooms are visited, I should say DONE. But how do I know when that's the case? Maybe when the current room's directions only lead back to already visited rooms. But without knowing the total number of rooms, it's tricky. The example ends when the Bedroom has only south, which probably leads back to a previous room, so they stop.\n\nSo the strategy might be to always choose a direction that hasn't been taken yet, unless there's only one direction left, which might mean we're done. But how to track visited rooms? Since the user can't",
