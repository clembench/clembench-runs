	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Home gym and can only go west. So first, I should go west to the next room. Let's say that's the first move.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, after moving west, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose the next room is a Living room with directions north, east, and south. I need to decide which direction to take next. The goal is to minimize room changes, so I should explore all possible paths without backtracking if possible. But how do I know which direction leads to unvisited rooms?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe I should use a depth-first search approach. That way, I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since I need to minimize the number of changes, maybe a breadth-first approach isn't better? Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The key is to visit all rooms with the fewest steps. So, if I can traverse through connected rooms without revisiting, that's optimal. But without knowing the full map, I have to make decisions based on current info. Each time I enter a room, I should check available directions and pick one that hasn't been explored yet. But how to track visited rooms?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So, once all possible directions from the current room lead to already
