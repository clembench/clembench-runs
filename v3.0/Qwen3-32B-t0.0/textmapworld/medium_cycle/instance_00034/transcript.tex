	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Solarium. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Solarium and can only go west. So first, I should go west to the next room. Let's say that's the Library. Now, from the Library, what directions are available? If there are multiple directions, I need to choose the one that allows me to cover the most unvisited rooms. But since I don't know the layout yet, maybe I should use a depth-first approach, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. Wait, but the goal is to minimize room changes. Hmm, maybe a breadth-first approach would be better? No, actually, since each move is a room change, the key is to traverse each room once without revisiting. But without knowing the full map, it's tricky. Let's proceed step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt First move: GO west from Solarium to Library. Now, in the Library, suppose the available directions are north, east, and south. I need to pick a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. If I go north, maybe that's a new room. Then from there, continue exploring. If I hit a dead end, backtrack. But how do I know when all rooms are visited? The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So once all exits from the current room lead to already visited rooms, and there are no unvisited
