In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Kitchen, and the available directions are south and east. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I should probably use a strategy that ensures I don't miss any rooms. Maybe a depth-first search? That way, I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I need to remember which rooms I've already visited to avoid going in circles.\n\nWait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So I need to track visited rooms. But the example didn't mention that. Oh, maybe the system keeps track automatically? Or maybe the user expects me to assume that once I can't go in any new direction, I'm done. But how do I know if there's a new room or not?\n\nIn the example, when they entered the Bedroom with only a south direction, they went back to the previous room, which was already visited, so they stopped. So maybe the key is to check if all available directions from the current room lead to already visited rooms. If so, then we're done.\n\nSo the plan is: always choose a direction that leads to a new room first. If all directions lead to rooms we've already been to, then we're done. But how do I know which direction is unvisited? Since the user doesn't provide a map, I",
