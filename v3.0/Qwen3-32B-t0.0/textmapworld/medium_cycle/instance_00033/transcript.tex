	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Billiard room and can go north or south. The goal is to minimize the number of times they change direction, right? So maybe I should try to go in one direction as much as possible before backtracking.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I'll start by choosing one direction. Let's say north. If I go north, maybe that leads to more rooms that need to be explored. But I don't know what's north or south yet. Wait, the example had them go west from the Kitchen, then north from the Lobby, and then done. So maybe the strategy is to explore as far as possible in one direction before turning back.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I know if going north or south leads to more unvisited rooms? Since I don't have a map, I have to make decisions based on the available directions each time. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, where you go as deep as possible before backtracking. That way, you minimize the number of turns because you don't switch directions unless necessary.\\ \tt \\ \tt So starting in the Billiard room, available directions are north and south. Let's pick north first. Then, in the next room, check the available directions. If there's a new direction that hasn't been taken yet, go that way. If not, backtrack. But how do I track which rooms have been
