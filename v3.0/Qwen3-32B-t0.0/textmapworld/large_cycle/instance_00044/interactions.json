In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably pick a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. Let's go north first. Wait, but maybe I should consider which direction allows me to cover more rooms without backtracking. If I go west, maybe that's a dead end? Or maybe not. Let me think. If I go north, maybe that leads to another room with more options. Let's try north first. Then, from there, see what directions are available. If I hit a dead end, I can backtrack. But the goal is to minimize room changes, so I need to plan a route that covers all rooms efficiently. Maybe a depth-first search approach? Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. Let's start with north.\n</think>\n\nGO: north",
