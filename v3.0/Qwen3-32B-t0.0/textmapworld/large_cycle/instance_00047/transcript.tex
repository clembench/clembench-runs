	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Game room and can go east. The example shows that when there's only one direction, you take it, and when you can't go further, you go back. But how do I know when to stop?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably start by moving east from the Game room. Let's say that takes me to another room. Then, I need to check the available directions there. If there are multiple directions, I need to choose the one that leads to unvisited rooms. But since I don't have a map, I have to track which rooms I've already been to. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention keeping track of visited rooms. Hmm, maybe the system is designed so that once you can't go any further without revisiting, you just stop. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example ends when the user is in the Bedroom with only south, and then they do DONE. So maybe when you reach a dead end (only one direction, which is back the way you came), you stop. But how do you know if all rooms are visited? Maybe the problem assumes that once you can't proceed further without backtracking, you're done. But that might not cover all rooms. Maybe the correct approach is to use a depth-first search strategy, always choosing a direction that hasn't been taken yet, and backtracking
