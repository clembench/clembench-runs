In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably pick a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. Let's go north first. Wait, but maybe I should consider which direction allows me to cover more rooms without backtracking. If I go north, maybe that's a dead end. Let me think. If I go west, maybe that's a longer path. Let's try north first. Then, after that, I can check other directions. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Once I can't go anywhere new, I'll stop. Let's start with north.\n</think>\n\nGO: north",
