In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. But I don't know the layout yet. Maybe I should pick one direction first and explore as far as possible before backtracking. Let's try going north first. If that leads to a dead end, I can come back and try another direction.\n\nWait, but the example used a depth-first approach. So maybe I should do the same. So from Laundry, go north. Then, from the next room, keep going in a direction that hasn't been visited yet. If I hit a dead end, backtrack by going back the way I came. But I need to keep track of visited rooms. Since I can't remember, maybe the system will prompt me each time. Let's start with north. Let's see what happens.\n</think>\n\nGO: north",
