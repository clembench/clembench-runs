	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Recreation room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best path to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Recreation room, directions are south and west. Hmm. I should probably pick one direction first, maybe south, and see where that leads. But wait, maybe I should consider if going west first might lead to more rooms. Without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Maybe a depth-first approach would work here. Let's try going south first. If that leads to a dead end, I can backtrack. But how do I know if there are unvisited rooms? Since I can't see the entire map, I have to rely on the directions given each time. Let's start by moving south. If the next room has more directions, I can explore from there. If I hit a dead end, then I'll go back and try west. But the key is to minimize the number of changes. So maybe stick to one direction as long as possible. Let's go with south first.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: south
