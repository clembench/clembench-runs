In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best path to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Craft room, directions are north and west. Hmm. I should probably pick one direction first. Maybe go north first. Let's say I go north. Then, from there, I need to check if there are new rooms. But wait, I don't know what's north of the Craft room yet. Maybe it's another room. But without knowing the layout, I have to make decisions based on the available directions each time.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to a graph traversal where each room is a node and directions are edges. The goal is to visit all nodes with minimal steps. So maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, where I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since I don't have the full map, I have to keep track of visited rooms and directions taken.\n\nStarting in Craft room, directions are north and west. Let's choose one, say north. Then, in the next room, check available directions. Suppose from there, there's another direction not yet explored. Continue until a dead end, then backtrack. But how do I know when all rooms are visited? Since I can't see the entire map, I need to track each room I enter. Once I can't go to any unvisited rooms from the current one, I might need to backtrack. But the problem says",
