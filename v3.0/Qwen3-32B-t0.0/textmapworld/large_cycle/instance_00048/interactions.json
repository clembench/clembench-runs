In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably pick one direction first. Maybe go south first. Wait, but maybe west leads to more rooms? Not sure. Let's try south first. So, GO: south.\n\nNow, where did that take me? Let's say it's the Living room. Suppose the Living room has directions north (back to Game), east, and maybe others. If I go east from Living room, maybe that's another room. But I need to make sure I don't miss any. Maybe a depth-first search approach? Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. So if I go south to Living room, then east to another room, then keep going until I hit a dead end, then backtrack. But I need to track visited rooms. Wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe I need to keep track of which rooms I've already been to. But the user isn't giving me a map, so I have to infer based on the directions given each step. \n\nWait, the example shows that after entering a room, the available directions are listed. So each time I move, I can see which directions are available. The challenge is to choose directions in a way that covers all rooms with minimal steps. So maybe I",
