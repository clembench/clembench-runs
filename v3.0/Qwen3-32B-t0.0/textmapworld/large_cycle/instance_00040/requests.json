In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best path to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Utility room with directions north, south, west, east. Hmm. Since there are four directions, maybe I should pick one and explore that branch first. Let's go north first. Wait, but maybe I should consider which direction leads to the most unvisited rooms. But I don't have a map, so I have to make decisions as I go.\n\nWait, the example used a specific path. Maybe I should use a depth-first search approach, going as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. So from Utility, pick a direction, say north. Then from there, explore all possible directions, making sure to mark rooms as visited. But since I can't remember the path, maybe I need to rely on the available directions each time. Let me try to simulate.\n\nStarting at Utility. Directions: N, S, W, E. Let's pick north first. Then, when I enter the next room, I need to check which directions are available. Suppose I go north. Now, in the new room, I should check if there are unvisited directions. If there are, continue in one of them. If not, backtrack. But how do I know if a direction leads back to a visited room? For example, if I go north from Utility, maybe the next room has a direction that leads back to Utility.",
