In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Guest room, the only direction available is west. So I should go west first. Let me note that down.\n\nAfter moving west, I'll enter a new room. Let's say that's the next room. Now, depending on the directions available there, I need to decide which way to go next. The key is to avoid backtracking as much as possible. Maybe I should try to explore each direction systematically. If I hit a dead end, I might have to backtrack, but I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms.\n\nWait, the example given ends with \"DONE\" when there's only one direction left, which leads back to a previously visited room. So, if I'm in a room where all directions lead to rooms I've already been in, I should stop. But how do I track which rooms I've visited? Since the problem doesn't provide a map, I have to assume that each move takes me to a new room unless there's no other option. Hmm, maybe it's a standard maze where each room has unique connections, and I need to traverse it in a way that covers all possible rooms without repeating steps.\n\nLet me think step by step. Starting at Guest room, go west. Then, from there, check available directions. Suppose the next room has multiple directions. I should pick a",
