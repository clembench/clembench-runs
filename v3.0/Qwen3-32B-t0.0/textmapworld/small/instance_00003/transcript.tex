	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Bedroom, the only direction available is east. So I should go east first. Let me imagine the map. If I go east from the Bedroom, maybe that's the Living Room? Then, from there, what directions are available? Suppose the Living Room has north, south, east, west. But I need to track which rooms I've already visited to avoid going back. Wait, the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe I need to use a strategy like depth-first search, exploring as far as possible before backtracking. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, maybe a breadth-first approach would be better? Hmm, not sure. Let me think step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in Bedroom, go east. Let's say that takes me to the Living Room. Now, from Living Room, available directions. If there's north, south, east, west, but I came from west (since I went east from Bedroom), so west leads back. To avoid revisiting, I should choose another direction. Let's say I pick north next. Then from the next room, check directions again. If I keep going in new directions each time, I can cover all rooms. But if at any point all directions lead to already visited rooms, then I should stop. The challenge is to plan the path
