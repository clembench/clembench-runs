In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?",

I should probably pick one direction first. Let's go north first. Maybe that leads to more rooms. If I go north, then check where that takes me. Then, from there, see which directions are available. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Wait, but how do I know if there are unvisited rooms left? Maybe I need to keep track of the rooms I've already been to. But since I don't have a map, I have to rely on the directions given each time. Let's start by going north from the Closet. Let's say that takes me to another room. Then, from there, I'll check the available directions and try to explore each one, making sure to backtrack if necessary. If at any point all directions lead back to rooms I've already visited, then I can say DONE. But I need to minimize the number of steps. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. Let's try that. So first, GO north from Closet. Then, depending on the next room's directions, proceed accordingly. If I hit a dead end, I'll have to backtrack. But since I can't remember the path, I have to assume that each time",
