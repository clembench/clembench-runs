	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Studio. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Studio, the only direction available is west. So I should go west first. Let me note that down.\\ \tt \\ \tt After moving west, I'll enter a new room. Let's say that's the next room. Now, depending on the directions available there, I need to decide which way to go next. The key is to avoid backtracking as much as possible. Maybe I should try to explore all possible directions from each room before going back. But how do I know if there are unvisited rooms left?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem says I need to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit and then stop. So maybe I need to keep track of which rooms I've already been to. But since I don't have a map, I have to infer based on the directions given each step. If I ever find myself in a room where all available directions lead to rooms I've already visited, then I know I'm done if there are no unvisited rooms left.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I ensure I cover all rooms? Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here. Go as far as possible in one direction, then backtrack if necessary. But since I want the fewest changes, maybe I should prioritize directions that haven't been taken yet. However, without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Let's proceed step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in
