	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Pantry, the only direction available is north. So I should go north first. Let me note that down.\\ \tt \\ \tt After moving north, I'll be in the next room. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. Suppose it's the Dining Room, and maybe the directions are east and south. If I go east, maybe that leads to another room, but I need to make sure I don't miss any. Wait, the example had a Kitchen, then Lobby, then Bedroom. So maybe the structure is linear? But I don't know the actual layout here. The user hasn't provided the map, so I have to make decisions based on the directions given as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt The key is to use a strategy that ensures all rooms are visited. Since I can't see the entire map, a depth-first search approach might work. That means going as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But I need to track which rooms I've already visited to avoid cycles.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So each time I enter a room, I should check if all adjacent rooms have been visited. If not, choose a direction that leads to an unvisited room. If all adjacent rooms are visited, then backtrack until there's a new direction to explore.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how
