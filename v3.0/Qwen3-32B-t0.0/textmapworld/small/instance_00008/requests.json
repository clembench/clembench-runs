In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Closet, directions are west and east. Hmm. I should probably pick a direction that leads to more rooms. But I don't know what's beyond west or east yet. Maybe I should go east first. Wait, but maybe west leads to a room that connects to more places. Without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Maybe a depth-first approach would work here. Let's try going east first. If that leads to a dead end, I can backtrack. So first step: GO: east.\n\nNow, after moving east, let's say I enter a room. The next step would depend on the available directions there. Suppose the next room has directions like north, south, etc. I need to keep track of visited rooms to avoid revisiting. But since I don't have a map, I have to assume that each direction leads to a new room unless it's a dead end. If I hit a room with only one direction (the way I came), then I need to backtrack. The key is to explore as far as possible in each direction before backtracking. If all adjacent rooms are visited, then I can stop. But how do I know when all are visited? Since the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe once I return to the starting point and all directions have been explored,",
