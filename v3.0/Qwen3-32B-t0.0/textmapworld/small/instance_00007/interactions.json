In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So first, I should go west. But I don't know what's there yet. Let's start by moving west.\n\nAfter moving west, I'll be in a new room. Let's say that's Room A. Now, I need to check the available directions from there. Suppose Room A has directions like north, east, south, or west. The goal is to visit all rooms, so I need to explore each possible path without backtracking too much. \n\nWait, but how do I know if there are unvisited rooms? Since I can't track visited rooms, maybe I need to use a systematic approach. Maybe a depth-first search? That way, I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But the problem is that I have to minimize the number of changes. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize directions that haven't been taken yet. But without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Let's proceed step by step. The first move is west. Then, depending on the next room's directions, I'll choose a direction that hasn't been used yet. If I reach a dead end, I might have to backtrack. But the challenge is to know when all rooms are visited. Since the user can't track visited rooms, maybe the problem expects",
