In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Kitchen, and the available directions are north and south. Hmm. The example they gave used west and then north, but here it's different.\n\nFirst, I should probably choose a direction to explore. Let's say I go north first. But wait, maybe there's a better strategy. Like, maybe I should prioritize directions that might lead to more unvisited rooms. But without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Maybe a depth-first approach? Go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking.\n\nSo starting in the Kitchen, directions are north and south. Let's pick one. Let's go north. Then, when I enter the next room, I'll check the available directions there. If there's a new direction, I'll go that way. If not, maybe I have to backtrack. But how do I know if all rooms are visited? Maybe I need to keep track of visited rooms. But the problem is that the user isn't providing a map, so I have to make decisions based on the current state.\n\nWait, the user is providing the current room and available directions each time. So each step, I can decide based on the current room's options. The key is to minimize the number of changes. So maybe always go in a direction that hasn't been taken yet. But how to track that",
