In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

I should probably pick one direction first. Maybe go south first. Wait, but I don't know what's connected. Let me think. If I go south, maybe that leads to another room, and then from there, I can explore other directions. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Alternatively, going west first. But without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Maybe a depth-first approach would work here. Let's try going south first. So first step: GO: south. Then, depending on where that leads, proceed from there. If that room has other directions, I'll explore them. If I hit a dead end, backtrack. But since I need to minimize room changes, maybe a systematic approach is better. Let's start with south.\n</think>\n\nGO: south",
