	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Sauna, the only direction available is east. So I should go east first. Let me assume that going east takes me to another room. Now, depending on what directions are available next, I need to choose a path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but I don't have a map. So I have to make decisions based on the directions given each time. The key is to explore all possible paths without repeating rooms. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, where I go as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since I want the fewest changes, maybe I should prioritize directions that haven't been taken yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I know if there are unvisited rooms? Each time I enter a new room, I should mark it as visited. If all adjacent rooms have been visited, then I can stop. But since I don't have a list of all rooms, I have to infer when there are no new rooms left. Hmm. The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit and then say DONE.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the strategy is: always choose a direction that leads to an unvisited room if possible. If all directions lead to already visited rooms, then we're done. But how do I track visited rooms? Since the user is providing the current room and
