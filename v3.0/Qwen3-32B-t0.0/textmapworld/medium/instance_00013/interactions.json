In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Wine cellar. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?",

The user is in the Wine cellar, and the available directions are west and east. Hmm. The key here is to plan a path that covers all rooms without backtracking too much.\n\nFirst, I should consider that each time I move, I want to go in a direction that hasn't been explored yet. But since I don't know the layout, I have to make decisions based on the available directions. Let's start by choosing one direction, maybe east first. If I go east from the Wine cellar, maybe that leads to another room with more directions. If I go west, perhaps that's a dead end or a room with fewer options. But without knowing the actual map, I have to assume that choosing a direction that allows for more exploration is better.\n\nWait, the example given ends when there's only one direction left, and then they say DONE. So the strategy might be to traverse in a way that covers all possible rooms by always moving into unvisited rooms first. Since the user is in the Wine cellar with west and east, I need to pick a direction that leads to more rooms. Let's say I go east first. If that leads to a room with more exits, I can continue exploring. If I go west and it's a dead end, then I might have to backtrack, which would increase the number of changes. So",
