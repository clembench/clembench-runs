	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best path to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Sauna, directions are south and east. Hmm. I should probably choose a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. But I don't know the layout yet. Maybe I should try one direction first, like south. Let's go south first. Then, from there, I'll check the available directions again. If there's a new room, I'll go there. If not, maybe backtrack. But I need to keep track of which rooms I've already visited to avoid going in circles. Wait, but the problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms left. So maybe a depth-first search approach? Explore as far as possible in one direction before backtracking. Let's try that. So first step: GO south from Sauna. Then see what's next.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: south
