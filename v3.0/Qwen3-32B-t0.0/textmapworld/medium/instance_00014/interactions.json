In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?",

I should probably pick one direction first. Maybe go south first. Let's try that. Then, from the next room, check available directions. But I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. Wait, maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, where I go as far as possible before backtracking. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, maybe a breadth-first approach isn't better? Or maybe it's better to explore one direction completely before moving to another. Let me think. If I go south from Utility, maybe that leads to a room that has more directions. Then, after exploring that path, I can go back and take the east direction. But how do I know when I'm done? Once all rooms are visited, I should say DONE. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst step: GO: south. Let's see where that takes me. Suppose I enter a room with directions north (back to Utility) and maybe others. Then I need to check if there are unvisited rooms. If I go east from Utility next, maybe that's another path. But I need to track visited rooms. Wait, the problem doesn't mention keeping track of visited rooms, but the example ends with DONE when there are no new rooms. So maybe",
