	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. The user is in the Dining room and can go north. The example shows that when there's only one direction left, they use DONE. So maybe I should follow a path that covers all rooms without backtracking.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, from the Dining room, the only direction is north. So I should go north. Let's say that leads to another room. Then, depending on the available directions there, I need to choose a direction that hasn't been visited yet. If there are multiple options, maybe pick one and mark it as visited. If I ever end up in a room with only one direction that's already been visited, then I should stop. But how do I track visited rooms? Since the problem doesn't mention a way to mark them, maybe I have to assume that once a direction is taken, it's considered visited. Wait, but the example shows that when in the Bedroom with only south (which is the way back), they use DONE. So maybe the idea is to explore all possible directions, but once you can't go further without revisiting, you stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the strategy would be to always go in a direction that hasn't been taken yet. If there's only one direction left, and it's the way back, then DONE. But how to know which directions are unvisited? Since the problem doesn't provide a map,
