	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best path to visit all rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Billiard room with directions south, west, and east. Hmm. Since I want to minimize room changes, maybe I should choose a direction that leads to the most unvisited rooms. But I don't have a map, so I have to make decisions as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I'll pick one direction. Let's say I go south first. Then, from there, I'll check the available directions. If I hit a dead end, I might backtrack. But backtracking would increase the number of changes, so I need to avoid that. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking if necessary. But since I don't know the layout, I have to make each decision based on the current room's available directions. I'll need to keep track of visited rooms to know when I'm done. Let's start by choosing south.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: south
