In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Hmm. Since I want to minimize room changes, maybe I should choose a direction that leads to the most unvisited rooms. But I don't have a map, so I have to make decisions as I go.\n\nFirst, I'll pick one direction. Let's say I go south first. Then, from there, I'll check the available directions. If I hit a dead end, I might backtrack. But backtracking would increase the number of changes, so I need to avoid that. Maybe a depth-first search approach would work here, exploring as far as possible in one direction before backtracking if necessary. But since I don't know the layout, I have to make each decision based on the current room's available directions. I'll need to keep track of visited rooms to know when I'm done. Let's start by choosing south.\n</think>\n\nGO: south",
