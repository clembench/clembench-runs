	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Nursery. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Nursery, directions are west and east. Hmm. I should probably pick a direction that leads to unvisited rooms. But I don't know what's connected yet. Maybe I should go east first. Wait, but maybe west? Let me think. If I go east, maybe that leads to more rooms. Or maybe west. Since I don't have any info, maybe I should just pick one. Let's go east first. Then, from there, see which directions are available. I need to make sure I don't miss any rooms. If I hit a dead end, I can backtrack. But the goal is to minimize room changes, so maybe a depth-first approach? Explore as far as possible before backtracking. Let's try that. So first, GO: east.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east
