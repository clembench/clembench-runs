	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Laundry room. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest changes. Starting in the Laundry room, which has a direction south. So first, I should go south. That's the only option. Let's say that takes me to another room. Now, I need to check what directions are available there. But since I don't have the full map, I have to assume that each move is necessary. The key is to avoid backtracking. Maybe it's a linear path? If after going south, there's another direction, I need to choose the one that hasn't been visited yet. But if I end up in a room where all directions lead to already visited rooms, then I can't go further and have to stop. Wait, the example ends when there's only one direction left, which is south in the Bedroom, leading back. So in that case, they stop. So the strategy is to traverse each room once, using a depth-first approach, maybe. So here, starting with Laundry, go south. Let's say that's the only direction, so proceed. Then, in the next room, check available directions. If there's more than one, pick the next unvisited. If all are visited, then done. But since the user is giving step-by-step responses, I need to simulate that. But since I don't have the actual map, I have to make the best possible path.
