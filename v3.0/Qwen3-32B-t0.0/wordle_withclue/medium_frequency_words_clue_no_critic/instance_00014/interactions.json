You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: nine-to-five routine",

A nine-to-five job is typically a regular work schedule, maybe something like office work. Words related to routine or work... Maybe \"routine\" itself? But that's seven letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, the target word is five letters. Let me think. Words like \"job,\" but that's three letters. \"Work\" is four. Maybe \"daily\"? No, that's five letters but not sure. Or \"habit\"? Also five letters. But how does that connect to nine-to-five? Maybe \"clock\"? As in clocking in and out? But that's five letters. Or \"shift\"? That's five letters and refers to a work shift. Yeah, \"shift\" could fit. Let me check if that's a valid guess. The clue is about a routine, so shift work is part of a daily routine. I'll go with \"shift\" as the first guess.\n</think>\n\nexplanation: The clue \"nine-to-five routine\" suggests a work schedule or daily routine. \"Shift\" is a five-letter word commonly associated with work hours and routines.\nguess: shift",
