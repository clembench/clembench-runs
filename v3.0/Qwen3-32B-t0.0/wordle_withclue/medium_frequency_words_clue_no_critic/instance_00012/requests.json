The clue is \"like venture capital investments.\" Hmm, venture capital investments are typically high-risk, high-reward. Maybe the word is something related to that. Words like \"risky\" or \"speculative\"? But the target word is five letters.\n\nWait, venture capital often involves funding startups. Maybe \"start\"? But that's five letters. Let me think. Another angle: venture capital is a type of investment, so maybe the word is \"angel\" (as in angel investors)? No, that's five letters. Or \"funds\"? But that's five letters too. Wait, the clue says \"like venture capital investments,\" so maybe the word is \"risky\" but that's five letters. Wait, \"risky\" is five letters. Let me check. R-I-S-K-Y. Yes, five letters. But is there a better fit? Alternatively, maybe \"highs\" or \"stakes\"? Like high stakes? But venture capital is high risk, high reward. Maybe \"hazard\"? No, that's six letters. \"Daring\"? Five letters. Hmm. Let me think again. The example given was \"apple\" for \"snowy white.\" So maybe the answer is a word that's metaphorically related. Venture capital investments are often called \"high-risk,\" so maybe the word is \"risky.\" Let me go with that. So the first guess would be \"risky.\"\n</think>\n\nexplanation",
