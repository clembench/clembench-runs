	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like venture capital investments

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "like venture capital investments." Hmm, venture capital investments are typically high-risk, high-reward. Maybe the word is something related to that. Words like "risky" or "speculative"? But the target word is five letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, venture capital often involves funding startups. Maybe "start"? But that's five letters. Let me think. Another angle: venture capital is a type of investment, so maybe the word is "angel" (as in angel investors)? No, that's five letters. Or "funds"? But that's five letters too. Wait, the clue says "like venture capital investments," so maybe the word is "risky" but that's five letters. Wait, "risky" is five letters. Let me check. R-I-S-K-Y. Yes, five letters. But is there a better fit? Alternatively, maybe "highs" or "stakes"? Like high stakes? But venture capital is high risk, high reward. Maybe "hazard"? No, that's six letters. "Daring"? Five letters. Hmm. Let me think again. The example given was "apple" for "snowy white." So maybe the answer is a word that's metaphorically related. Venture capital investments are often called "high-risk," so maybe the word is "risky." Let me go with that. So the first guess would be "risky."\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation
