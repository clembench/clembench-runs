	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: shrewd

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "shrewd". I need to think of a five-letter word that relates to being shrewd, which means clever or having sharp mental faculties. Maybe words like "sharp" or "clever" themselves? But "clever" is six letters. Wait, the target word must be exactly five letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: synonyms for shrewd. Words like "sly", but that's four letters. "Canny" comes to mind. C-A-N-N-Y. That's five letters. Let me check if "canny" is a valid word. Yes, it means having or showing sharp practical sense, which fits the clue. So my first guess would be "canny". Let me make sure there's no other possible word. Maybe "sharp" is another option, but "sharp" is five letters. However, the clue is "shrewd", and "sharp" can also mean shrewd. But maybe "canny" is more directly related. I'll go with "canny" as the first guess.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: The clue "shrewd" suggests a word meaning clever or having sharp mental acuity. "Canny" is a five-letter word meaning showing sharp practical sense, fitting the clue.\\ \tt guess: canny
