	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: virile

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "virile," which means having or showing masculine strength and vigor. So I need to think of a five-letter word that relates to that. Maybe a word that's associated with strength or masculinity.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should consider synonyms of "virile." Words like strong, powerful, tough, or maybe even specific terms like "brawn" or "muscle." But those might not be five letters. Let's check. "Brawn" is five letters. That's a possibility. But I'm not sure if that's the answer. Another thought: maybe a name? Like "Herc" from Hercules, but that's four letters. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given was "apple" for "snowy white," so maybe the answer is a word that's part of a phrase or a term related to the clue. "Virile" could be linked to "manly," but that's five letters. "Manly" is a valid word. Let me check: M-A-N-L-Y. Yes, five letters. That seems plausible. But I should think if there's another word. Maybe "stout"? No, that's more about being thick or strong, but maybe not directly virile. "Tough" is four letters. "Power" is five letters. "Power" could work, but does it directly relate to virile? Maybe. But "manly" seems more direct.
