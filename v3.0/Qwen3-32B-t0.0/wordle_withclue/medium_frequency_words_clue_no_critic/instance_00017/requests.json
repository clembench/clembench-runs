The clue is \"virile,\" which means having or showing masculine strength and vigor. So I need to think of a five-letter word that relates to that. Maybe a word that's associated with strength or masculinity.\n\nFirst, I should consider synonyms of \"virile.\" Words like strong, powerful, tough, or maybe even specific terms like \"brawn\" or \"muscle.\" But those might not be five letters. Let's check. \"Brawn\" is five letters. That's a possibility. But I'm not sure if that's the answer. Another thought: maybe a name? Like \"Herc\" from Hercules, but that's four letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example given was \"apple\" for \"snowy white,\" so maybe the answer is a word that's part of a phrase or a term related to the clue. \"Virile\" could be linked to \"manly,\" but that's five letters. \"Manly\" is a valid word. Let me check: M-A-N-L-Y. Yes, five letters. That seems plausible. But I should think if there's another word. Maybe \"stout\"? No, that's more about being thick or strong, but maybe not directly virile. \"Tough\" is four letters. \"Power\" is five letters. \"Power\" could work, but does it directly relate to virile? Maybe. But \"manly\" seems more direct.",
