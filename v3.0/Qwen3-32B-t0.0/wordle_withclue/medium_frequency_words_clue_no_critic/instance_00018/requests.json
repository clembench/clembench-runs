The clue is \"court activity.\" Hmm, court could refer to a place like a tennis court, basketball court, or maybe a courtroom. But the activity part makes me think of sports. So maybe a sport played in a court. Let's think of five-letter words.\n\nTennis is a sport played on a court, but that's six letters. Maybe \"tenns\"? No, that's not a word. How about \"volleyball\"? Too long. \"Badminton\" is too long too. Wait, maybe \"squash\"? That's a sport played in a court. Squash is five letters. S-Q-U-A-S-H. Wait, no, that's six letters. Oh, right, \"squash\" is six letters. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: court could be a legal court. Activity there might be \"trial,\" but trial is five letters. T-R-I-A-L. That's possible. But the clue says \"court activity,\" so maybe something more specific. Or maybe \"judge\"? But that's a person, not an activity. \"Hear\" is four letters. \"Hears\"? No. \n\nWait, maybe \"serve\"? In tennis, you serve the ball. Serve is five letters. S-E-R-V-E. That fits. Let me check. If the court is for tennis, then serving is part of the activity. So \"serve\" could be the word. Let me think",
