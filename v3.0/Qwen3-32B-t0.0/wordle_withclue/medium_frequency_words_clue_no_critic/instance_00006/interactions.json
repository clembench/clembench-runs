You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: like algae",

Maybe the word is a type of algae or something related to them.\n\nFirst, I should consider common five-letter words associated with algae. Let me think... There's \"algae\" itself, but that's five letters. Wait, the target word is five letters, and \"algae\" is exactly five letters. But maybe the answer is a different word. Let me check. The clue says \"like algae,\" so maybe a synonym or a related term.\n\nAnother thought: algae are often green, so maybe \"green\"? But \"green\" is five letters. But does that fit the clue? The clue is \"like algae,\" so if algae are green, then \"green\" could be a possible answer. But I need to verify. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe \"algae\" is the word, but since the clue is \"like algae,\" perhaps it's a different word. Alternatively, maybe a type of algae, like \"seaweed,\" but that's seven letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"algae\" is the answer. Let me check the letters. A-L-G-A-E. Yes, five letters. But the clue is \"like algae,\" not \"algae.\" So maybe the answer is a word that's similar to algae in some way",
