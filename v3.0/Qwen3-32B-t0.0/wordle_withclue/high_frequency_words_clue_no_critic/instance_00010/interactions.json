You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: stand in (for)",

Like when someone takes another person's place. The phrase \"stand in for\" is often used in contexts like acting or work. So maybe the word is \"proxy\"? Wait, proxy is five letters. Let me check. P-R-O-X-Y. Yes, five letters. But does it fit the clue? A proxy is someone who stands in for another, so that could work. Alternatively, maybe \"agent\"? But agent is five letters too. Wait, the clue is \"stand in (for)\", so the word might be \"proxy\". Let me think if there are other possibilities. Another word could be \"stand\" itself, but that's part of the clue. Maybe \"surrogate\"? No, that's longer. \"Deputy\"? D-E-P-U-T-Y, six letters. No. \"Substitute\" is too long. \"Fill in\" is a phrase, but the word needs to be five letters. So \"proxy\" seems like a good fit. Let me confirm the definition. A proxy is a person authorized to act for another. Yes, that matches \"stand in for\". So the guess would be \"proxy\".\n</think>\n\nexplanation: The clue \"stand in (for)\" suggests a word related to substitution or representation. \"Proxy\" is a five-letter word meaning someone who stands",
