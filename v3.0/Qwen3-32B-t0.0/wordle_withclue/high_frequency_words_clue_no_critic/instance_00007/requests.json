The clue is \"others'\". Hmm, that's a possessive form, so maybe the target word is related to something that belongs to others. But I need to think of a five-letter word. Let me brainstorm.\n\nFirst, \"others\" could refer to people in general. Maybe words like \"their\" but that's only four letters. Or \"theirs\" which is six letters. Not helpful. Wait, the clue is \"others'\", which is the possessive form, so maybe the word is something that others have. Let me think of synonyms for \"others'\" or related terms. Maybe \"alien\"? No, that's five letters but not directly related. Or \"other\" itself, but that's five letters without the apostrophe. Wait, the target word is a five-letter word, so maybe \"other\" but that's five letters. Wait, \"other\" is five letters? O-T-H-E-R, yes, that's five letters. But the clue is \"others'\", which is possessive. Maybe the answer is \"other\" but that's not possessive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is something that others have, like \"their\" but again, too short. Let me think of words that relate to possession or belonging. \"Belong\" is six letters. \"Owned\"? No. Wait, maybe \"alien\" as in not belonging. But the clue is \"others'\", so maybe \"their",
