The clue is \"called for his fiddlers ___\". Hmm, I need to figure out the five-letter word that fits here. The phrase \"called for his fiddlers\" makes me think of a common expression or idiom. Wait, there's a saying like \"called for his fiddlers three\" from the song \"The Unquiet Grave\" or something similar. But three is four letters. Maybe it's \"called for his fiddlers three\", but the blank here is probably a number. But the target word is five letters. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different phrase. \"Fiddlers\" could be part of a metaphor. Oh! There's a famous line from the movie \"The Godfather Part II\" where the character says \"And I love you too, Michael. Now, don't ever forget it. Don't ever forget it. Don't ever...\" but that's not it. Wait, maybe it's from a song or a poem. Oh! The phrase \"called for his fiddlers three\" is part of a longer line. But the blank is a five-letter word. Let me think of numbers in words. \"Three\" is five letters. Wait, \"three\" is five letters? No, T-H-R-E-E is five letters. Yes! So if the clue is \"called for his fiddlers ___\", the answer might be \"three\". Let",
