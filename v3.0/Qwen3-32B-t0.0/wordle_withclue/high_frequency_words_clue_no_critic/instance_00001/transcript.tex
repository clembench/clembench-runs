	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: comatose

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "comatose." I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Comatose means in a deep sleep or unconscious state. Maybe a medical term or something related to sleep.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should consider words that are synonyms or related to comatose. Words like "stupor," but that's six letters. "Trance"? That's five letters. Let me check. Trance is a state of near-unconsciousness, which fits the clue. Also, it's five letters. So maybe "trance" is the target word. Let me make sure there's no other possibilities. Another thought: "dormant," but that's seven letters. "Sleep"? That's five letters, but maybe too simple. The clue is "comatose," which is more severe than just sleep. "Trance" seems better. Let me go with "trance" as the first guess.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: The clue "comatose" suggests a state of deep unconsciousness. "Trance" is a five-letter word that can refer to a similar state of altered consciousness or near-unawareness.  \\ \tt guess: trance
