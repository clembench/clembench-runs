You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: divine ___",

The phrase \"divine ___\" could be part of a common expression or title. Maybe \"divine comedy\"? But that's two words. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think of words that come after \"divine\". There's \"divine grace\", but \"grace\" is five letters. Let me check if that's a possibility. The clue is just \"divine ___\", so maybe the answer is \"grace\". But I'm not sure. Another possibility could be \"divine spark\", but \"spark\" is five letters. Hmm. Alternatively, \"divine light\"? \"Light\" is five letters. But I need to consider common phrases. \"Divine comedy\" is a famous work, but \"comedy\" is six letters. Wait, maybe \"divine right\"? \"Right\" is five letters. That's a historical concept. So \"right\" could be a candidate. Let me think again. The clue is just \"divine ___\", so maybe the answer is \"grace\" as in \"divine grace\". But I'm not certain. Let me make a first guess with \"grace\" and see if the feedback helps. Alternatively, maybe \"angel\"? But \"angel\" is five letters. But does \"divine angel\" make sense? Not really. \"",
