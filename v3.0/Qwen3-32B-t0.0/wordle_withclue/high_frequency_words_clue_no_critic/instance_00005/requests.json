The clue is \"divine ___\". I need to think of a five-letter word that fits this. The phrase \"divine ___\" could be part of a common expression or title. Maybe \"divine comedy\"? But that's two words. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think of words that come after \"divine\". There's \"divine grace\", but \"grace\" is five letters. Let me check if that's a possibility. The clue is just \"divine ___\", so maybe the answer is \"grace\". But I'm not sure. Another possibility could be \"divine spark\", but \"spark\" is five letters. Hmm. Alternatively, \"divine light\"? \"Light\" is five letters. But I need to consider common phrases. \"Divine comedy\" is a famous work, but \"comedy\" is six letters. Wait, maybe \"divine right\"? \"Right\" is five letters. That's a historical concept. So \"right\" could be a candidate. Let me think again. The clue is just \"divine ___\", so maybe the answer is \"grace\" as in \"divine grace\". But I'm not certain. Let me make a first guess with \"grace\" and see if the feedback helps. Alternatively, maybe \"angel\"? But \"angel\" is five letters. But does \"divine angel\" make sense? Not really. \"",
