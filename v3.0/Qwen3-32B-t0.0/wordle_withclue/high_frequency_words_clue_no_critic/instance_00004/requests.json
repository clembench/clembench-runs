The clue is \"1985 hit by heart.\" I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Heart is a band, right? They had a hit in 1985. Let me recall... Oh, right! \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was a big hit that year. But that's longer than five letters. Wait, maybe the song title has a five-letter word. Let me think. The song is \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" but maybe the word is \"love\"? But \"love\" is four letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the actual song title by Heart in 1985. Let me check. Oh, Heart's 1985 album was \"Dance,\" but that's four letters. Maybe a song from that album? There's a song called \"These Dreams.\" \"These\" is five letters. Let me confirm. \"These Dreams\" was a 1986 hit, but maybe the clue is a bit off? Or maybe I'm mixing up the years. Alternatively, \"Never\" is a five-letter word, but not sure. Another possibility: \"Magic Man\" was an earlier hit. Not 1985. Wait, \"Alone\" by Heart was released in 1984 but maybe had a hit in 1985. \"Alone\" is five letters.",
