You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart",

Let me recall... Oh, right! \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was a big hit that year. But that's longer than five letters. Wait, maybe the song title has a five-letter word. Let me think. The song is \"What's Love Got to Do with It,\" but maybe the word is \"love\"? But \"love\" is four letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the actual song title by Heart in 1985. Let me check. Oh, Heart's 1985 album was \"Dance,\" but that's four letters. Maybe a song from that album? There's a song called \"These Dreams.\" \"These\" is five letters. Let me confirm. \"These Dreams\" was a 1986 hit, but maybe the clue is a bit off? Or maybe I'm mixing up the years. Alternatively, \"Never\" is a five-letter word, but not sure. Another possibility: \"Magic Man\" was an earlier hit. Not 1985. Wait, \"Alone\" by Heart was released in 1984 but maybe had a hit in 1985. \"Alone\" is five letters.",
