The clue is \"longtime supreme court name.\" I need to think of a five-letter word related to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has justices, and some names might be associated with it. Let me brainstorm.\n\nFirst, \"longtime\" suggests someone who has been there for a long time. Maybe a justice's name? But the word needs to be five letters. Let me think of famous justices. There's Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but her last name is longer. Maybe \"Ginsburg\" is too long. What about \"Scalia\"? That's six letters. \"Breyer\"? Five letters. Wait, Stephen Breyer is a justice. But \"Breyer\" is six letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a person's name. The Supreme Court itself is sometimes referred to as \"the Court,\" but that's not five letters. Maybe \"Supreme\" is part of it, but that's seven letters. Wait, the clue says \"longtime supreme court name,\" maybe a nickname or a term associated with it. The Supreme Court has been around for a long time, so maybe a term like \"senate\"? No, that's not related. Wait, the Supreme Court has nine justices. Maybe \"justice\" but that's seven letters. \n\nWait, maybe it's a term that's part of the court's name. The full name is \"Supreme Court of the United",
