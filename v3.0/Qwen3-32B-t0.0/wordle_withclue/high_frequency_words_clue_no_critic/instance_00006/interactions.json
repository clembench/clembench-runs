You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: tv's\"___dad\"",

Like \"TV's ___ Dad\". Let me think of TV shows that end with \"Dad\". There's \"My Dad\" but that's two words. Wait, maybe \"TV's ___ Dad\" is a show title. Oh, \"TV's ___ Dad\" could be \"TV's ___ Dad\" as in a show where the dad is the main character. Let me think of possible words. The word needs to be five letters. Maybe \"TV's ___ Dad\" is a show like \"TV's ___ Dad\" where the blank is a word that fits. For example, \"TV's ___ Dad\" could be \"TV's ___ Dad\" where the blank is a word like \"My\" but that's two letters. Wait, the blank is three letters because the total is five letters. Wait, the clue is \"tv's\" ___ dad. The total word is five letters. So the structure is \"tv's [blank] dad\", but the actual word is five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is a hint towards the word, not the full title. For example, maybe the word is \"daddy\" but that's five letters. But \"daddy\" is more than five letters.
