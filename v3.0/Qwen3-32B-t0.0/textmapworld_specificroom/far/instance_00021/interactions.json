Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

Let's assume that moving east takes me to the next room. But I don't know the layout yet. I need to keep track of the rooms I visit. Let's say after going east, I enter a room. Depending on what room it is, I'll decide the next direction. Since the target is Solarium, I need to figure out the path step by step. Maybe there's a map in my mind, but since I don't have one, I'll have to proceed logically. Let's proceed with the first step: GO: east.\n</think>\n\nGO: east",
