	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. I need to get from the Bathroom to the Solarium. The available direction is east. So first, I should go east. Let me check if that's the right move.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Bathroom, going east. What room is east of the Bathroom? Maybe a hallway or another room. Let's assume that moving east takes me to the next room. But I don't know the layout yet. I need to keep track of the rooms I visit. Let's say after going east, I enter a room. Depending on what room it is, I'll decide the next direction. Since the target is Solarium, I need to figure out the path step by step. Maybe there's a map in my mind, but since I don't have one, I'll have to proceed logically. Let's proceed with the first step: GO: east.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east
