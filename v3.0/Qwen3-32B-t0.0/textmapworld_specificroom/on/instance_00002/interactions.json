Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Craft room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n",

Wait, but if I'm in the target room already, I don't need to move anywhere else. The instructions say that once we find the target room, I should answer with \"DONE\". So even though there's a direction available, since I'm already at the Craft room, the correct response is DONE. I shouldn't go west because that would take me out of the target room. The example shows that when they entered the target room, they responded with DONE regardless of available directions. So the answer here is just DONE.\n</think>\n\nDONE",
