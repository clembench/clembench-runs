The target room is the Study room, and I'm already in the Study room. So I just need to confirm that I'm there. The available directions are north and west, but since I'm already at the target, I should just say DONE. No need to move anywhere else. The example shows that once you enter the target room, you respond with DONE. So I'll just output that.\n</think>\n\nDONE<|im_end|>",
