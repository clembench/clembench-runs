	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Home theater. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target room is the Home theater, and I'm already in the Home theater. So I don't need to move anywhere else. The available direction is west, but since I'm already at the target, I should just say DONE. No need to go anywhere. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says once we've found the target, answer with DONE. Yep, that's the case here. So the answer is DONE.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE
