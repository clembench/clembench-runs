Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

The target is the Foyer, and I'm starting in the Study. The available directions are north and west. Hmm, I need to figure out which way to go. Since I don't have a map, I'll have to make a choice and see where it leads.\n\nMaybe I should try going north first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. Let's go with north. If I enter a room from the north, maybe the next steps will become clearer. If the next room is the Foyer, then great. If not, I'll have to check other directions. Let's take the first step north.\n</think>\n\nGO: north<|im_end|>",
