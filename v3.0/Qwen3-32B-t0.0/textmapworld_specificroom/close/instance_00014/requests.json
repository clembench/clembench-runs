Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

The target is the Studio, and I'm starting in the Game room. The available directions are north, west, and east. I need to figure out which direction to go first.\n\nHmm, I don't have a map, so I'll have to explore step by step. Maybe I should try one direction and see where it leads. Let's pick north first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. So, I'll go north. Let's hope that's the right move towards the Studio. If I hit a dead end, I'll have to try another direction. But since the example used west and then north, maybe a similar approach here. But the target is Studio, so I need to remember the possible connections. Let's just take the first step and see.\n</think>\n\nGO: north<|im_end|>",
