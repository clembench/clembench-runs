	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Studio. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: north, west, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The target is the Studio, and I'm starting in the Game room. The available directions are north, west, and east. I need to figure out which direction to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, I don't have a map, so I'll have to explore step by step. Maybe I should try one direction and see where it leads. Let's pick north first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. So, I'll go north. Let's hope that's the right move towards the Studio. If I hit a dead end, I'll have to try another direction. But since the example used west and then north, maybe a similar approach here. But the target is Studio, so I need to remember the possible connections. Let's just take the first step and see.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: north
