Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

Since I don't have a map, I'll have to make educated guesses based on typical room layouts.\n\nBalconies are usually connected to living areas or bedrooms. Maybe going north leads to a main room. Let me try north first. If that doesn't work, I can backtrack. Let's go with north.\n</think>\n\nGO: north",
