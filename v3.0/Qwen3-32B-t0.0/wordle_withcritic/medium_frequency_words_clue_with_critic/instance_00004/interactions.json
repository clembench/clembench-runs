You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: pilsner",

Let me think of five-letter words connected to pilsner. The word \"pilsner\" itself is seven letters, so that's too long. Maybe a key term in brewing? There's \"hops\", but that's four letters. \"Malt\"? Also four. \"Brews\"? That's five letters. Wait, \"brews\" is a valid word. Let me check if that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe \"lager\", which is another type of beer. But lager is five letters. But the clue is pilsner, which is a specific type of lager. So maybe the answer is \"lager\"? But I need to make sure. Another angle: pilsner is a beer style, so maybe the word is \"beer\" but that's four letters. \"Brews\" is five. Or \"yeast\" used in brewing. Yeast is five letters. Let me think. The user might be looking for a term directly related. Let me go with \"lager\" first since it's a type of beer like pilsner. Let me check if that's a good guess.\n</think>\n\nexplanation: Pilsner is a type of beer, and \"lager\" is another category of beer",
