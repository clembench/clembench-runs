The clue is \"virile.\" Hmm, virile means having or denoting the qualities traditionally associated with men, like strength or courage. So I need to think of a five-letter word related to that.\n\nFirst, maybe a synonym for virile. Words like \"manly\" come to mind, but that's five letters. Wait, \"manly\" is five letters. Let me check: M-A-N-L-Y. Yes, that's five. But I should make sure it's a valid word. Yes, \"manly\" is a valid English word. Another possibility could be \"sturdy,\" but that's six letters. \"Brave\" is five letters, but does that fit the clue? The clue is \"virile,\" which is more about masculinity than bravery. \n\nWait, \"masculine\" is too long. Maybe \"strong\"? S-T-R-O-N-G is six letters. No. \"Brawny\" is six letters. Hmm. \"Manly\" seems the best fit. Let me think if there are other words. \"Tough\" is five letters. But \"tough\" is more about being strong or hard, maybe not directly related to virility. \n\nAnother angle: maybe a word that's part of a phrase related to virility. Like \"manhood,\" but that's seven letters. \"Daring\" is six letters. \"Bold\" is four letters. \"Hero",
