	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: virile

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "virile." Hmm, virile means having or denoting the qualities traditionally associated with men, like strength or courage. So I need to think of a five-letter word related to that.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, maybe a synonym for virile. Words like "manly" come to mind, but that's five letters. Wait, "manly" is five letters. Let me check: M-A-N-L-Y. Yes, that's five. But I should make sure it's a valid word. Yes, "manly" is a valid English word. Another possibility could be "sturdy," but that's six letters. "Brave" is five letters, but does that fit the clue? The clue is "virile," which is more about masculinity than bravery. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "masculine" is too long. Maybe "strong"? S-T-R-O-N-G is six letters. No. "Brawny" is six letters. Hmm. "Manly" seems the best fit. Let me think if there are other words. "Tough" is five letters. But "tough" is more about being strong or hard, maybe not directly related to virility. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: maybe a word that's part of a phrase related to virility. Like "manhood," but that's seven letters. "Daring" is six letters. "Bold" is four letters. "Hero
