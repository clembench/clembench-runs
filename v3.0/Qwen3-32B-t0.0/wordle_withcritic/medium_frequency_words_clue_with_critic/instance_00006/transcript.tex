	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like algae

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "like algae." Algae are usually green, right? So maybe the word is related to green or something similar. The target word is five letters. Let me think of words that are synonyms for algae or related. Maybe "green"? But "green" is five letters. Wait, algae are often referred to as green, but is there another word? Or maybe "algae" itself? But that's five letters too. Wait, "algae" is actually five letters: A-L-G-A-E. But the clue says "like algae," so maybe the answer is "algae"? But the user might be looking for a different word. Alternatively, maybe a word that's similar in some other way. Let me check. If I guess "algae," would that make sense? The clue is "like algae," so maybe the answer is a word that's similar in meaning or property. But algae are a type of organism, so maybe the answer is "green" because they are green. Let me think. "Green" is five letters. But maybe another word. Alternatively, "seaweed"? No, that's seven letters. Hmm. Wait, maybe "algae" is the answer. Let me check the letters. A-L-G-A-E. Yes, five letters. So maybe the first guess should be "algae." But the user might have a different word in mind. Let me go
