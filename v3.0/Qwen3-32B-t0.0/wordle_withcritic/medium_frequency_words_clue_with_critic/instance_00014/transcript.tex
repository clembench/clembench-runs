	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: nine-to-five routine

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "nine-to-five routine." Hmm, that makes me think of work or something related to a daily schedule. The phrase "nine-to-five" usually refers to a typical workday from 9 AM to 5 PM. So maybe the word is something related to work, like "job," but that's only three letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The word "routine" is part of the clue. Maybe the answer is a synonym for routine. Words like "habit," but that's five letters. Wait, "habit" is five letters. Let me check. H-A-B-I-T. Yes, five letters. But does "habit" fit with the nine-to-five clue? A nine-to-five routine is a daily routine, so maybe "habit" is a possible answer. Alternatively, maybe "daily" but that's five letters too. D-A-I-L-Y. But "daily" is more about each day, not necessarily the routine itself. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "nine-to-five" could be referring to a job or office work. Maybe the word is "office," but that's six letters. No. "Work" is four letters. Hmm. Wait, maybe "clock" because people clock in and out? But that's five letters. C-L-O-C-K. But does that fit the clue? The nine-to-five routine is about working hours, so
