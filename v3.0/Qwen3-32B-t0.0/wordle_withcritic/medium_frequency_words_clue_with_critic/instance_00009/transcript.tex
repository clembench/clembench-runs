	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: waffle topping

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "waffle topping." So I need to think of a five-letter word that's related to something you put on a waffle. Common toppings are syrup, butter, fruit, maybe chocolate or cream. Let's break it down.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, syrup is a common one. It's five letters: s-y-r-u-p. That fits. But wait, maybe there's another possibility. Butter is six letters, so that's out. Maybe "jam"? But that's three letters. "Custard" is too long. "Honey" is five letters. Hmm, honey is another possibility. But the clue is "waffle topping," and syrup is more classic. Let me check the letters. Syrup: S-Y-R-U-P. All lowercase, valid letters. I think that's a good guess. The user might agree with syrup as the answer. Let me go with that.\\ \tt </think>\\ \tt \\ \tt explanation: A common waffle topping is syrup, which is a 5-letter word.\\ \tt guess: syrup
