The clue is \"tend the hearth.\" Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Tending the hearth usually involves keeping a fire going, maybe something like a stove or a fireplace. Let me think of synonyms for hearth. There's \"fireplace,\" but that's too long. Maybe \"stove\"? But that's five letters. Wait, \"stove\" is five letters. Let me check. S-T-O-V-E. Yes, that's five letters. But does \"stove\" relate to tending the hearth? Well, tending the hearth could involve a stove or a fireplace. Alternatively, maybe \"flame\"? But that's five letters too. F-L-A-M-E. But does that fit the clue? The hearth is where the fire is, so maybe \"flame\" is part of it. But I'm not sure. Another thought: \"tend the hearth\" might be a metaphor for taking care of the home, so maybe a word like \"homey\"? No, that's five letters but not sure. Wait, maybe \"cozy\"? C-O-Z-Y, but that's four letters. Hmm. Let me think again. The hearth is the fireplace in a home. Maybe \"ash\"? No, too short. \"Ember\"? E-M-B-E-R. That's five letters. Embers are the hot",
