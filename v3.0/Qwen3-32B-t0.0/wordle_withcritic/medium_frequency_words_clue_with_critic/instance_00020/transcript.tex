	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: winter wear

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "winter wear." I need to think of a five-letter word related to clothing worn in winter. Common winter clothes include items like coats, hats, scarves, gloves, boots, etc. Let me list some five-letter words from these categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "coat" is four letters, so that's out. "Hats" is four letters too. "Scarf" is five letters. That's a possibility. "Gloves" is six letters. "Boots" is five letters. "Sweater" is seven letters. "Jacket" is six. "Mittens" is seven. "Trench" is six. "Parka" is five letters. "Fur" is three. "Snowsuit" is too long. \\ \tt \\ \tt So the options are scarf, boots, parka. Let me check if there are others. "Shawl" is five letters. "Bib" is three. "Hood" is four. "Tights" is six. \\ \tt \\ \tt Between scarf, boots, parka, and shawl. The clue is "winter wear," so all of these are valid. But which one is more likely? Maybe "scarf" is a common answer. Let me think of other possibilities. "Glove" is five letters. But gloves are usually plural as "gloves," which is six letters. Wait, "glove" is singular
