You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

The clue is \"sweetheart.\" I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Sweetheart can mean a term of endearment, like a lover or someone you care about. Maybe a synonym? Words like \"beloved\" but that's too long. \"Darling\" is seven letters. Hmm. Wait, \"honey\" is five letters. But is that too common? Or maybe \"lover\"? That's five letters. Let me check. \"Lover\" fits. But is there another possibility? The clue is \"sweetheart,\" so maybe \"angel\"? But angel is five letters. Or \"dear\" but that's four. Wait, \"sweet\" is five letters but the clue is \"sweetheart,\" so maybe \"sweet\" is part of it. But the target word is a synonym. Alternatively, \"sugar\" is five letters. Let me think. Which of these is more likely? The example used \"apple\" because of Snow White. So maybe the answer is a direct synonym. \"Lover\" seems possible. Let me go with that.\n</think>\n\nexplanation: \"Sweetheart\" is a term of endearment, often used to refer to a romantic partner. A common synonym for this is \"lover,\" which is a five-letter word.\nguess: lover<|im_end|>",
