The clue is \"divine ___\". I need to think of a five-letter word that fits after \"divine\". Common phrases with \"divine\" might be \"divine being\", \"divine power\", or \"divine grace\". But the word has to be five letters.\n\n\"Divine being\" is a possibility, but \"being\" is six letters. Wait, maybe \"divine soul\"? No, \"soul\" is four letters. How about \"divine light\"? \"Light\" is five letters. That could work. Let me check if \"light\" is a valid word. Yes, it's a valid English word. Also, \"divine light\" makes sense as a phrase. So the guess would be \"light\". Let me make sure there's no other five-letter word that fits better. Maybe \"divine gift\"? \"Gift\" is four letters. \"Divine power\" is \"power\", which is five letters. But \"power\" might not be as directly connected to \"divine\" as \"light\". Hmm. Alternatively, \"divine grace\" is a common phrase, but \"grace\" is five letters. Wait, \"grace\" is five letters. So maybe \"grace\" is a better fit. Let me think again. The clue is \"divine ___\", so the word after \"divine\" should be a noun. Both \"light\" and \"grace",
