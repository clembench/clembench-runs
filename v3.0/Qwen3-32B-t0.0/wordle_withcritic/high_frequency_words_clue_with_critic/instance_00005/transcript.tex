	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: divine ___

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "divine ___". I need to think of a five-letter word that fits after "divine". Common phrases with "divine" might be "divine being", "divine power", or "divine grace". But the word has to be five letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt "Divine being" is a possibility, but "being" is six letters. Wait, maybe "divine soul"? No, "soul" is four letters. How about "divine light"? "Light" is five letters. That could work. Let me check if "light" is a valid word. Yes, it's a valid English word. Also, "divine light" makes sense as a phrase. So the guess would be "light". Let me make sure there's no other five-letter word that fits better. Maybe "divine gift"? "Gift" is four letters. "Divine power" is "power", which is five letters. But "power" might not be as directly connected to "divine" as "light". Hmm. Alternatively, "divine grace" is a common phrase, but "grace" is five letters. Wait, "grace" is five letters. So maybe "grace" is a better fit. Let me think again. The clue is "divine ___", so the word after "divine" should be a noun. Both "light" and "grace
