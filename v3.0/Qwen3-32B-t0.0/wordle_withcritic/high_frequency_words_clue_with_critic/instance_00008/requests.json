The clue is \"tv show since 1/14/52\". Hmm, I need to think of a TV show that started on January 14, 1952. Wait, that date might be significant. Let me recall some long-running TV shows. Oh, \"I Love Lucy\" was a classic show that started in the 1950s. But when exactly? Let me check my memory. I think \"I Love Lucy\" premiered in 1951, but maybe the date is different. Wait, another possibility is \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", but I'm not sure about the start date. Alternatively, \"The Tonight Show\" started later. Wait, maybe it's \"Gunsmoke\"? No, that was 1955. Wait, the date given is January 14, 1952. Let me think again. Oh! \"The Honeymooners\" started in 1955, so that's too late. Wait, maybe \"Father Knows Best\"? No, that was 1954. Hmm. Wait, \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" started in 1952, but I'm not sure of the exact date. Alternatively, \"I Love Lucy\" was on CBS starting October 1951, so maybe not. Wait, maybe the answer is \"I Love Lucy\"",
