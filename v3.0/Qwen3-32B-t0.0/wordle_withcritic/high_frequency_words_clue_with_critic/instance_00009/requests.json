The clue is \"gauge reading.\" I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Gauge is a device that measures something, like a meter or a scale. Reading could refer to the measurement or the act of taking a measurement. Maybe the word is \"meter\"? But \"meter\" is five letters. Wait, but \"gauge\" and \"meter\" are similar. Let me check. Meter is a unit of measurement, but maybe the target word is \"level\"? No, that's five letters too. Hmm. Another thought: when you take a reading from a gauge, you might get a \"value.\" But \"value\" is five letters. Let me think again. \"Scale\" is another possibility, but that's five letters as well. Wait, \"gauge\" itself is six letters. The clue is \"gauge reading,\" so maybe the word is \"index\"? Because an index can be a reading or a measurement. Let me confirm. Index is five letters. Or \"range\"? No, that's five letters too. Maybe \"angle\"? Not sure. Let me go with \"index\" as a possible guess. But wait, another thought: \"level\" is a common term related to measurements. Let me check the letters. L-E-V-E-L. Oh, that's five letters. But \"level\" is a measurement of flatness. Maybe that's it. Alternatively, \"angle\" could",
