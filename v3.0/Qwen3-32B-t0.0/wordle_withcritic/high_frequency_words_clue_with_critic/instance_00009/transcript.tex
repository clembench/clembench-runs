	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: gauge reading

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "gauge reading." I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Gauge is a device that measures something, like a meter or a scale. Reading could refer to the measurement or the act of taking a measurement. Maybe the word is "meter"? But "meter" is five letters. Wait, but "gauge" and "meter" are similar. Let me check. Meter is a unit of measurement, but maybe the target word is "level"? No, that's five letters too. Hmm. Another thought: when you take a reading from a gauge, you might get a "value." But "value" is five letters. Let me think again. "Scale" is another possibility, but that's five letters as well. Wait, "gauge" itself is six letters. The clue is "gauge reading," so maybe the word is "index"? Because an index can be a reading or a measurement. Let me confirm. Index is five letters. Or "range"? No, that's five letters too. Maybe "angle"? Not sure. Let me go with "index" as a possible guess. But wait, another thought: "level" is a common term related to measurements. Let me check the letters. L-E-V-E-L. Oh, that's five letters. But "level" is a measurement of flatness. Maybe that's it. Alternatively, "angle" could
