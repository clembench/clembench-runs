The clue is \"called for his fiddlers ___\". Hmm, I need to figure out the five-letter word that fits here. The phrase \"called for his fiddlers\" makes me think of a common expression or idiom. Wait, there's a saying \"called for his fiddlers three times\" which is part of the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The piper was supposed to get paid for getting rid of the rats, but the town didn't pay him, so he came back and made the children dance away. The part about the fiddlers might be a variation or a different version of the story.\n\nBut the clue is just \"called for his fiddlers ___\", so maybe the missing word is \"three\"? Let me check. The original story has the piper calling the children away, but the fiddlers part might be a play on words. Alternatively, maybe it's a different phrase. Another thought: \"fiddlers three\" could be part of a song or a nursery rhyme. Wait, \"The Three Little Pigs\" has three pigs, but that's not fiddlers. Or maybe \"Three Blind Mice\"? No, that's not it either.\n\nWait, the phrase \"called for his fiddlers three times\" is part of the Pied Piper legend. So the missing word here might be \"three\". Let me confirm. If the clue is \"called for",
