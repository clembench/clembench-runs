The clue is \"1985 hit by heart.\" I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Heart is a band, right? They had a hit in 1985. What songs did they have around that time? Oh, \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" was a big hit for Tina Turner in 1985, but that's not by Heart. Wait, Heart's big song from 1985... Maybe \"Never\"? No, that's four letters. Wait, \"Alone\" by Heart was a hit in 1987, but maybe the user is thinking of a different one. Alternatively, \"Magic Man\" was from 1971. Hmm. Maybe the user is referring to \"Crazy for You\" by Madonna, but that's 1985. Wait, no, the clue says \"by heart.\" Let me think again. Heart's \"These Dreams\" was a hit in 1986. Not 1985. Maybe the user is thinking of a different band. Wait, \"Careless Whisper\" by George Michael was 1984. Maybe the user made a mistake with the year. Alternatively, \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" by Foreigner in 1985. But that's not Heart. Wait, maybe the user is thinking of \"Heaven",
