You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

The clue is \"comatose.\" Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word related to that. Comatose means in a deep sleep or unconscious state. Maybe a medical term? Or something related to sleep.\n\nFirst, I should consider synonyms. Words like \"asleep,\" but that's six letters. \"Stupor\" is six letters too. Wait, maybe \"dormant\"? No, that's seven letters. \"Trance\"? That's six letters. Hmm. Maybe \"unconscious,\" but that's too long. \n\nWait, the target word is five letters. Let me think again. \"Comatose\" is a state of prolonged unconsciousness. Maybe the word is \"coma\" itself. But \"coma\" is four letters. Adding an 's' makes \"comas,\" which is five letters. Is \"comas\" a valid word? Yes, it's the plural of coma. But does it fit the clue? The clue is \"comatose,\" which is an adjective. Maybe the answer is \"comat,\" but that's not a word. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a word that's part of the medical terminology related to comatose. \"Sedated\"? No, that's seven letters. \"Drugged\"? Seven letters. \"Sleepy\"? Five letters. But \"sleepy\" is more about being drowsy, not exactly comatose. \n\nWait,",
