The clue is \"tv's ___ dad\". Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word related to TV's dad. Wait, maybe it's a show title? There's a show called \"TV's Dad\" but that's not a word. Wait, maybe it's a character. Like, in some TV shows, there's a dad character. But the clue is \"tv's ___ dad\". Maybe the blank is a word that when combined with \"dad\" makes a show title. For example, \"The Dad Show\" but that's not five letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. So maybe the answer is a word that fits into the blank to make a show name. Let me think. There's a show called \"My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad\" but that's too long. Wait, maybe \"Dad's\" something? No. Alternatively, maybe it's a play on words. The word \"dad\" itself is three letters, so the blank would be two letters. But the target word is five letters. Wait, the clue is \"tv's ___ dad\", so the entire phrase would be \"tv's [word] dad\". The word needs to be five letters. Let me think of TV shows that have \"dad\" in the title. There's \"The Dad Show\", but again, not five letters. Wait, maybe the word is \"daddy\", but that's five letters",
