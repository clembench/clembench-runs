	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: stand in (for)

	 <think>\\ \tt Okay, let's see. The clue is "stand in (for)". Hmm, I need to think of a five-letter word related to that phrase. The phrase "stand in for" usually means to substitute or replace someone. So maybe a word that means substitute or replacement.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, possible words could be "proxy", but that's five letters. Wait, "proxy" is five letters. Let me check: p-r-o-x-y. Yes, five letters. That fits. Another possibility is "stand" itself, but that's six letters if I add something. Wait, the target word is five letters. "Stand" is five letters, but the clue is "stand in (for)", so maybe the answer is "stand" but that seems too direct. Wait, the clue is a hint towards the word, not necessarily part of the phrase. Let me think again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "stand in for" could relate to acting as a substitute. Words like "actor" or "agent"? But "actor" is five letters. A-C-T-O-R. That's five letters. But does "actor" relate to standing in for someone? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, "proxy" is a term used in substitution. Like a proxy vote, where someone stands in for another. So "proxy" seems plausible. Let me check the letters again. P-R-O-X-Y. Five letters. That works. I think that's a good guess. Let
