The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: back, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda.\nYour opponent's team words are: copper, fist, titanium, sheep, horse, grenade, steel, bronze.\nDistractor words are: car, trailer, aluminum, oxygen, cave, dill, sage.\nThe kill words are: walnut.\n<|assistant|>\n",
