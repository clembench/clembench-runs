The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: jacks, pear, watermelon, stairs, opossum, window, meteorology, professor, cello.\nYour opponent's team words are: train, plum, tie, salesperson, harp, ceiling, basement, lion.\nDistractor words are: blueberry, violin, puzzle, medicine, top, actor, cougar.\nThe kill words are: hat.\n<|assistant|>\n",
