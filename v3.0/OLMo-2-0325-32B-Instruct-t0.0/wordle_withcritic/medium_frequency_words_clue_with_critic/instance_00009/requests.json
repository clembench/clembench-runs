You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: waffle topping\n<|assistant|>\nexplanation: Maple syrup is a common waffle topping and it has five letters.\nguess: maple<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nclue: waffle topping\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess 'maple' matches the clue 'waffle topping' and fits the criteria of being a five-letter word. however, without guess feedback, we cannot confirm if it is the correct word. agreement: yes\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word\n<|assistant|>\nexplanation: The agreement confirms that 'maple' is a plausible guess based on the clue, but without feedback on letter correctness, I will maintain the guess.\nguess: maple<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nguess_feedback: m<red> a<red> p<yellow> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word\n<|assistant|>\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'p' is the only correct letter in 'maple'. This suggests that the target word may have 'p' in a different position. Considering common waffle toppings and five-letter words, 'syrup' comes to mind, but it has six letters. 'Sugar' is another possibility, fitting the five-letter requirement and having 'p' as a different letter.\nguess: sugar<|endoftext|>\n<|user|>\nclue: waffle topping\nguess_agreement: no\nagreement_explanation: the guess 'sugar' does not match the clue 'waffle topping' as accurately as 'maple' did, and it does not contain the correct letters as per the feedback. the feedback indicates 'p' as the only correct letter in the previous guess 'maple', which is not present in 'sugar'. agreement: no\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word\n<|assistant|>\nexplanation: The feedback shows 'p' as the only correct letter from the previous guess 'maple'.
