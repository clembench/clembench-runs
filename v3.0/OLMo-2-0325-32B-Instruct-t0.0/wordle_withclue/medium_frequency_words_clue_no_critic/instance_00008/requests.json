The word \"update\" fits this description and has five letters.\nguess: update\n\nguess_feedback: u<yellow> p<yellow> d<green> a<yellow> t<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'd' is in the correct position (green), 'u' and 'p' are in the word but in the wrong position (yellow), and 'a', 't' are not in the word (red). This suggests that the correct word may have 'd' in the third position and may not contain 'a' or 't'. Considering the clue and the feedback, a word like \"edit\" could be a good next guess as it contains 'd' in the correct position and fits the theme of making something current.\nguess: edit<|endoftext|>",
