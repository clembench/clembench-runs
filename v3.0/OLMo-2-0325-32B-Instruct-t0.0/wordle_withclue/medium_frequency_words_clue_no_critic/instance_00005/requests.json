The word \"check\" fits the criteria as it is a common term used for marking items and has five letters.\nguess: check\n\nguess_feedback: c<yellow> h<red> e<green> c<yellow> k<red>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'e' is in the correct position (green), and 'c' appears once in the word but in a different position (yellow). The other letters are incorrect (red). This suggests that the target word may have 'e' in the third position and 'c' somewhere else. Considering the clue and the feedback, a word like \"check\" but with a different first letter and possibly a different last letter could be the target.\nguess: deck<|endoftext|>",
