	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like algae

	 explanation: The feedback shows only 'l' is correct and in the right position (second letter), while all other letters are incorrect. The clue "like algae" suggests a connection to green or aquatic life, but we must now use only 'l' in position 2 and avoid a, g, a, l (except the confirmed l). Possible words with 'l' as the second letter and no a, g include "plumb" or "climb", but we need a better fit. "Lilac" is a color associated with nature, but not algae. "Sleek" doesn't fit. Let’s try "clown" — no. Better: "flora" — but 'f' and 'r' not ruled out. Wait — "algal" failed, so we know 'a' and 'g' are wrong. Let’s try a word with 'l' in position 2 and no a/g: "climb" has 'i' and 'b' — possible. But "algal" had two l’s — now we know only one 'l' is valid. Try "plank" — no. "blend" — 'b','e','n','d' are new. "blend" fits: 5 letters, 'l' in position 2, no a/g. But does "blend" relate to algae? Not directly. "Slime" — 's','l','i
