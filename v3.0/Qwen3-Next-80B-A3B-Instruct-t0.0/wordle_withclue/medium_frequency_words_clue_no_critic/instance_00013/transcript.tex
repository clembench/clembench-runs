	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: baby conveyance

	 explanation: A baby conveyance is commonly a stroller or pram, and "stroller" is too long. The word "pram" is four letters, but "carriage" is too long. A five-letter word for a baby conveyance is "cradle," but that’s six letters. Another option is "bassinet," also too long. The most common five-letter word is "stroller" minus one letter? Wait — "pram" is four. Let me think: "waggon"? No. "carri" is incomplete. Ah — "baby" + "car" = "baby car"? Not a word. But "carriage" is too long. Wait — "stroller" is 7. What about "bassi"? No. Perhaps "crib"? Four letters. Maybe "pram" is the closest, but we need five. Another idea: "buggy" — yes! A baby buggy is a common term for a baby conveyance, and it’s five letters.\\ \tt guess: buggy
