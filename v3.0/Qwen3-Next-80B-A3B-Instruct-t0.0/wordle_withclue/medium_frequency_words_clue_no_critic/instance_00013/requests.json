The word \"pram\" is four letters, but \"carriage\" is too long. A five-letter word for a baby conveyance is \"cradle,\" but that’s six letters. Another option is \"bassinet,\" also too long. The most common five-letter word is \"stroller\" minus one letter? Wait — \"pram\" is four. Let me think: \"waggon\"? No. \"carri\" is incomplete. Ah — \"baby\" + \"car\" = \"baby car\"? Not a word. But \"carriage\" is too long. Wait — \"stroller\" is 7. What about \"bassi\"? No. Perhaps \"crib\"? Four letters. Maybe \"pram\" is the closest, but we need five. Another idea: \"buggy\" — yes! A baby buggy is a common term for a baby conveyance, and it’s five letters.\nguess: buggy<|im_end|>",
