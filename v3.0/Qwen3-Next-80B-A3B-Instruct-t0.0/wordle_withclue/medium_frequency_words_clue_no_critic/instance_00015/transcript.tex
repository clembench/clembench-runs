	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: passenger ship

	 explanation: The feedback shows 'i' is green (correct position), 'n' is yellow (correct letter, wrong position), and 't', 'a' are red (incorrect). This eliminates "titan" but suggests the word contains 'i' in position 2 and 'n' somewhere else. Considering "passenger ship," a valid five-letter ship name with 'i' in position 2 and 'n' elsewhere is "liners" — but that’s six letters. "Siren" fits: it’s a type of ship (siren ships in myth), has 'i' in position 2, 'n' at the end, and no 't' or 'a'.  \\ \tt guess: siren

	 explanation: The feedback shows 'i' and 'e' are green (correct positions 2 and 4), 'r' and 'n' are yellow (correct letters, wrong positions), and 's' is red (incorrect). This eliminates "siren." We need a five-letter passenger ship with 'i' in position 2 and 'e' in position 4, containing 'r' and 'n' elsewhere. "Cruise" is too long. "Ferry" has no 'n'. "Ocean" has no 'i'. "Liner" fits: 'i' in position 2, 'n' in position 5 (yellow), 'r' in position 3 (yellow), 'e' is not in "liner" — wait. "Liner" has no 'e'. Try "barge" — no 'i'. "Tugboat" too long. "Cabin" — no 'r' or 'e'. "Pirate" — six letters. "Maiden" — six. "Oceania" — too long. "Aeolian" — too long. "Cruise" — no 'i' in position 2. Wait — "liner" is correct for passenger ship, but lacks 'e'. What word has 'i' in pos2, 'e' in pos4, 'r' and 'n' elsewhere? "Rinse" — not a ship.
