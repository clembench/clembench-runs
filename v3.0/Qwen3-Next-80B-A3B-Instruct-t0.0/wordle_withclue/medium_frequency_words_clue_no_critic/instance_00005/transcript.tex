	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tick off

	 explanation: The feedback shows 'a' is correct but in the wrong position, while 'n', 'o', and 'y' are incorrect. "Tick off" suggests irritation or checking, so I focus on 5-letter words with 'a' but avoiding n, o, y. "Irate" fits as a synonym for annoyed, and contains 'a' in a different position.\\ \tt guess: irate

	 explanation: 'a', 't', and 'e' are correct but misplaced; 'i' and 'r' are incorrect. "Tick off" implies irritation, and the remaining letters must form a 5-letter word with a, t, e in different positions. "Mate" and "late" are candidates, but adding 'h' gives "hate" — not 5 letters. "Wait" is 4. Try "fate" — no 'f'. "Rate" — no 'r'. "Ate" is too short. Reconsider: "pate" has 'a', 't', 'e' — and 'p' is unused. "Pate" is 4. Try "bated" — too long. "Taste" — has 's'. Wait — "irate" failed. Try "fated" — too long. Focus: must use a, t, e, and two new letters. "Cater" — c, a, t, e, r — but 'r' was red. "Cater" invalid. "Haste" — h, a, s, t, e — 's' not used yet. 'a', 't', 'e' are yellow, so they must be in the word but not in current positions. "Haste" has 'a' in pos2 (was pos3), 't' in pos4 (was pos4? no
