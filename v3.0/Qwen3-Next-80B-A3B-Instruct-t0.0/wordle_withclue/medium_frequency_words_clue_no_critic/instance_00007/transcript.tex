	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: steinbrenner, to the yankees

	 explanation: George Steinbrenner was the longtime owner of the New York Yankees, and his name is 11 letters long — but we need a 5-letter word associated with him. The most iconic term tied to his legacy is "boss," as he was famously called "The Boss." Though "boss" is 4 letters, the closest 5-letter variant in common usage is "bossy," but that doesn’t fit the tone. Alternatively, "yankee" is 6 letters. Re-evaluating: the most direct 5-letter word linked to Steinbrenner and the Yankees is "boss" + a common suffix — but no. Wait — perhaps the word is "yanke" — no. Let’s think differently. Steinbrenner’s name is synonymous with authority and the Yankees’ identity. The word “owner” is 5 letters and directly describes his role.  \\ \tt guess: owner
