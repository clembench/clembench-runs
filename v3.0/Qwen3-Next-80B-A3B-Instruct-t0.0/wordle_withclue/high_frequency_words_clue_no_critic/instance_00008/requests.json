The longest-running daily soap opera with a 5-letter name is \"Days of Our Lives,\" but that’s too long. The only 5-letter TV show matching this date is \"Meet the Press,\" but that’s 11 letters. Wait — the clue points to the longest-running TV show ever, which is \"Meet the Press,\" but it’s not 5 letters. Let me reconsider: perhaps it’s “Sesame,” but that’s 6. “Mister Rogers” is too long. The only 5-letter show that fits the 1952 start date is “Gunsmoke,” which premiered in 1955. Wait — “Bonanza” started in 1959. “The Price is Right” is too long. The correct answer is “Guiding Light” — but again, too long. I must be missing it. Let me think of 5-letter shows from 1952: “Howdy Doody” is 10. “Captain Kangaroo” is 13. “The Today Show” is 10.
