You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: tv show since 1/14/52",

The longest-running daily soap opera with a 5-letter name is \"Days of Our Lives,\" but that’s too long. The only 5-letter TV show matching this date is \"Meet the Press,\" but that’s 11 letters. Wait — the clue points to the longest-running TV show ever, which is \"Meet the Press,\" but it’s not 5 letters. Let me reconsider: perhaps it’s “Sesame,” but that’s 6. “Mister Rogers” is too long. The only 5-letter show that fits the 1952 start date is “Gunsmoke,” which premiered in 1955. Wait — “Bonanza” started in 1959. “The Price is Right” is too long. The correct answer is “Guiding Light” — but again, too long. I must be missing it. Let me think of 5-letter shows from 1952: “Howdy Doody” is 10. “Captain Kangaroo” is 13. “The Today Show” is 10. Wait — “I Love Lucy” is 10. Perhaps the clue is misleading. The only 5-letter show that debuted in 1952 and is iconic is",
