No. \"carry\"? No. \"marry\"? No. \"sandy\"? No. \"perry\"? No. \"hurry\"? No. \"curry\"? No. \"berry\"? No. \"gry\" is not a valid ending. Wait — \"lorry\" has o and r — o is rejected. \"carry\" has a and y — a is allowed? Let me think: known 5-letter words ending in \"ry\": \"jury\" (4), \"ferry\" (5) — f,e,r,r,y — e is rejected. \"hurry\" — h,u,r,r,y — u and h not used yet, but e is rejected — \"hurry\" has no e. \"hurry\" — h,u,r,r,y — r and y are correct, and h,u are new. Is \"hurry\" related to logbook? No. \"merry\"? No. \"sirry\"? Not a word. \"derry\"? No. \"berry\"? b is rejected. \"cherry\"? c,h,e,r,r,y — e",
