Another major hit from Heart in 1985 is \"Alone,\" which is four letters. The most iconic 1985 Heart song with five letters is \"Barracuda,\" but that’s eight. Wait — “Crazy on You” is earlier. Let me think: “These Dreams” is 1985, but too long. The five-letter hit? Perhaps “Dog & Butterfly” — no. Actually, the 1985 hit with five letters is “Who Will You Run To?” — no. Wait — “Heart” had a hit called “Bebe le Strange,” but that’s not five. Let me reconsider: the song “Never” was a 1985 Heart hit, and it’s five letters. Yes! “Never” is a five-letter word, released in 1985 as a single from the album “Heart.”  \nguess: never<|im_end|>",
