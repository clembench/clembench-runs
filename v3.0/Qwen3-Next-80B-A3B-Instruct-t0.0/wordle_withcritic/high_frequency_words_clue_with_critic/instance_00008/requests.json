The longest-running TV show with five letters that fits this date is \"As the World Turns,\" but again, too long. The only iconic five-letter TV show starting in 1952 is \"Meet the Press,\" but that’s not five letters. Wait — “Sesame” is six. Let me reconsider: “Coronation Street” is too long. The only five-letter show that fits the 1952 start date and is iconic is “Gunsmoke,” which premiered in 1955. Hmm. Actually, the show that began on January 14, 1952, is “The Guiding Light,” but again, too long. Perhaps the clue refers to “Meet the Press,” but it’s not five letters. Wait — “All My Children” is too long. Let me think of five-letter shows from that era. “Bonanza” is six. “Perry Mason” is ten. “Dragnet” is seven. “The Lone Ranger” is too long. Perhaps the clue is misleading. But “Sesame” is six. Wait — “Mister Rogers” is too long. I think the intended answer is “Gunsmoke,” but it started in 1955. Let me check: January ",
