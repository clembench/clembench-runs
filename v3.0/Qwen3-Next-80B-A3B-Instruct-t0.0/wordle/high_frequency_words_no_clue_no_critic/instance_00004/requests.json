Letters b, c, h are incorrect and must be excluded. I will guess a word with 'e' in position 2, another 'e' in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (not 5, since first guess had 'e' there and it was yellow), avoiding b, c, h.  \nguess: eerie<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: e<yellow> e<green> r<yellow> i<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: the second letter 'e' is confirmed green (position 2). The first 'e' is yellow (correct letter, wrong position), and the third 'r' is yellow (correct letter, wrong position). The 'i' and fifth 'e' are incorrect and must be excluded. So the word contains 'e' in position 2, at least one more 'e' not in position 1 or 5, and an 'r' not in position 3. I will guess a word with 'e' in position 2, another 'e' in position 3 or 4, and 'r' in position 1 or 4, avoiding i and the fifth position for 'e'.  \nguess: refer<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: r<red> e<green> f<red> e<green> r<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: the second and fourth letters are confirmed 'e' (green), and the fifth letter is 'r' (green). The first letter 'r' is incorrect (red), so 'r' cannot be in position 1. The third letter 'f' is incorrect and must be excluded. The word must be _ e _ e r, with no 'r' in position 1 and no 'f'. I will guess a valid word matching this pattern: _ e _ e r, using only allowed letters.  \nguess: secer<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game.

'f' is incorrect. I will choose a valid English word matching _ e _ e r, such as \"sheer\".  \nguess: sheer<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> e<yellow> e<green> r<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: 'e' is confirmed in position 4 (green), 'r' in position 5 (green). The third 'e' is yellow, meaning 'e' is in the word but not in position 3 — so the second 'e' must be in position 2 (since position 4 is already taken). 's' and 'h' are incorrect and must be excluded. The word is now _ e e e r, but that’s invalid. Re-evaluating: position 2 must be 'e' (only remaining valid spot for the second 'e'), so the pattern is _ e e e r. But \"eeer\" isn’t valid. Instead, the third letter must be a new consonant. The correct pattern is _ e ? e r, with 'e' in 2 and 4, 'r' in 5, and third letter ≠ 'f', 's', 'h', 'i', 'a', 'p', 'l', 'b', 'c'. I’ll try \"theme\" — but 't' and 'm' are allowed. Wait, \"cheer\" has 'c' (excluded). Try \"beere\" — invalid. Valid word: \"steer\" — 's' excluded. \"deere\" — not common. \"wee\" is too short. Try \"sever\" — 's' excluded. \"leper\" — 'l'",
