Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: The X in row 3, column 2 is connected vertically to X's in row 2 and row 4, and the X in row 3, column 4 is connected vertically to X's in row 2 and row 5; neither is isolated.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
