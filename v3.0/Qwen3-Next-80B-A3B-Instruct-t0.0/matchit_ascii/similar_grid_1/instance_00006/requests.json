All other cells are empty (▢).<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 pattern with Xs forming a vertical line in the third column, extended horizontally in the third row to form a cross. Specifically: the third column has Xs in all five rows; the third row has Xs in all five columns; the remaining Xs are in positions (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (2,3), and (4,3), creating a symmetrical cross shape with no other Xs.\nQUESTION: In your grid, are there any Xs in row 2, column 4? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: different grids<|im_end|>",
