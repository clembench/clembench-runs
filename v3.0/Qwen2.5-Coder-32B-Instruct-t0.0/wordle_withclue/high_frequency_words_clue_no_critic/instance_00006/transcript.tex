	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tv's"___dad"

	 explanation: The clue suggests a word that could be related to a TV show or character named "Dad." A popular show featuring a character named Dad is "Malcolm in the Middle," where one of the characters is Frank-Thomas "Dad" Halliwell. However, since the word must be five letters long, I'll consider another possibility. Another show with a character named Dad is "The Dukes of Hazzard," where Bo and Luke Duke call their father "Dad." The word "dukes" is six letters long, so I'll focus on the name "Dad" itself and think of a five-letter word that could be associated with it. One possible word is "daddy."\\ \tt guess: daddy
