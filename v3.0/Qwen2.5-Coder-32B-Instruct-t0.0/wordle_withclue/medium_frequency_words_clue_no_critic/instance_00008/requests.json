A possible word could be \"modernize,\" but since it's longer than five letters, we need to find a shorter synonym or related term. \"Update\" comes to mind, but it's also too long. \"Freshen\" is another option, but again, it's too long. Considering the context, \"renew\" seems like a fitting choice as it means to make something new or current again.\nguess: renew<|im_end|>",
