Another famous song with \"fiddlers\" is \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" but the phrase there is \"fiddlers three.\" Given the structure of the clue, it seems to be asking for a single word that fits the context of calling for fiddlers. A common phrase is \"call for his fiddlers three,\" so the missing word could be \"three.\"\nguess: threee<|im_end|>",
