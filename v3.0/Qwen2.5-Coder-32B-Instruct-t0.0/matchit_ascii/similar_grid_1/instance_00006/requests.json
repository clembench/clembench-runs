Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. The middle row and the middle column form a cross made up entirely of 'X's. The top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners each have a single 'X'. All other positions are empty ('▢').<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns. The middle column has an 'X' in every row. The second and fourth rows have 'X's in the third and fourth columns. The third row is entirely filled with 'X's. There are no 'X's in the first and fifth rows except for the middle column.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any 'X's in the first and fifth rows, except for the middle column? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>",
