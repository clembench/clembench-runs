	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: 1985 hit by heart

	 explanation: The clue "1985 hit by heart" suggests a song title from the band Heart. One of their popular songs from that year is "What About Love" but it has more than 5 letters, however "alone" could fit as it's a song and has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: alone

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that "a", "l", and "o" are incorrect, while "n" and "e" are correct but in the wrong position. Considering the clue "1985 hit by heart", I'll think of another song by Heart that fits the given letters. One of their hits is "Never", but it doesn't fit, however, a 5-letter song title with "n" and "e" could be a good guess.\\ \tt guess: never
