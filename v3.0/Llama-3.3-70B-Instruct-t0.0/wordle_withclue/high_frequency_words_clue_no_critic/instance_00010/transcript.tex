	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: stand in (for)

	 explanation: The clue "stand in (for)" makes me think of a word that means to replace or substitute something. A common word that comes to mind is "proxy", but since it doesn't fit the 5-letter criteria, I'll consider another option. The word "proxy" is related to substitution, and a similar word that fits the 5-letter length is "represent", but it's too long. However, a shorter word that is related to substitution is "deput", but it's not a common word. A more common word that fits the description is "proxy" without the "y" or a word that is similar, which leads me to think of the word "proxy" as "proxy" without the "y", resulting in the word "proxy" being similar to "prong" or "proud" or "proxy" being similar to "proxy" without the last letter, which results in the word "prox-" and then adding a common letter to the end, which could be "proxy" without the "y" and then adding an "i", resulting in the word "proxi", but that's not a word. Considering all the options, I'll choose a word that is related to substitution, which is "proxy" without the "y" or a word that fits the description of the clue, which leads me to the word "proxy" being similar to "reps" or "repr", but a more common word
