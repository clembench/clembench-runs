A common word that comes to mind is \"proxy\", but since it doesn't fit the 5-letter criteria, I'll consider another option. The word \"proxy\" is related to substitution, and a similar word that fits the 5-letter length is \"represent\", but it's too long. However, a shorter word that is related to substitution is \"deput\", but it's not a common word. A more common word that fits the description is \"proxy\" without the \"y\" or a word that is similar, which leads me to think of the word \"proxy\" as \"proxy\" without the \"y\", resulting in the word \"proxy\" being similar to \"prong\" or \"proud\" or \"proxy\" being similar to \"proxy\" without the last letter, which results in the word \"prox-\" and then adding a common letter to the end, which could be \"proxy\" without the \"y\" and then adding an \"i\", resulting in the word \"proxi\", but that's not a word. Considering all the options, I'll choose a word that is related to substitution, which is \"proxy\" without the \"y\" or a word that fits the description of the clue, which leads me to the word \"proxy\" being similar to \"reps\" or \"repr\", but a more common word",
