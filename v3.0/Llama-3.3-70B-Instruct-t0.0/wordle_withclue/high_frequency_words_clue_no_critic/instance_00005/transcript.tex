	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: divine ___

	 explanation: Given that "i" and "g" are in the correct positions, and considering the clue "divine ___", a new guess should maintain the correct "i" and "g" while adjusting the other letters. Since "vigil" was already guessed and received the same feedback, the next guess should explore other words that fit the divine theme and the given letter positions. A possible word that aligns with these criteria and adjusts for the incorrect letters could be a term related to spirituality or the divine.\\ \tt guess: vigil is not correct, so trying a word that fits the "divine" clue and has "i" and "g" in the correct positions, such as "digit" does not fit the divine clue well, so considering another option like "swig" does not fit either, a possible guess could be a word that is directly related to the concept of divinity.\\ \tt guess: swigs does not fit, so trying "wigil" is not a word, so the next guess is \\ \tt guess: vigil was already tried, so trying a new word that has "i" and "g" and is related to "divine" \\ \tt guess: bigly is not a good fit, so trying \\ \tt guess: sigil
