	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: shrewd

	 explanation: The clue "shrewd" implies a word related to being clever or cunning. A common word that comes to mind is "smart", but since it doesn't fit the 5-letter criteria, I'll consider a synonym, "canny" doesn't fit either, however, a word that does is "craft" which is related to being shrewd in a business sense or "slyly" which also doesn't fit, another option could be "sharp" or a word that is closely related to "sharp" which is "shrew".\\ \tt guess: shrew

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters in the guess "shrew" are incorrect, so I need to start fresh. The clue "shrewd" implies a word related to being clever or cunning. A new guess could be a word that is synonymous with "shrewd", such as "canny" doesn't fit, but a word that does fit the 5-letter criteria is "sharp" or a word related to intelligence, like "brain" or "smart" doesn't fit, however "smart" has a synonym "quick" which also doesn't fit, another option is "wise" doesn't fit, but a word that is closely related to "wise" and fits the criteria is "wiser" doesn't fit, however a 5 letter word that is related to being clever is "witty".\\ \tt guess: witty

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that the letter "y" is correct and in the right position, while all other letters in the guess "witty" are incorrect. The clue "shrewd" implies a word related to being clever or cunning. With the correct letter "y" at the end, a new guess could be a word that is synonymous with "shrewd" and ends with the letter "y", such as "crafty" is too long, but a 5-letter word that fits is "flyby" doesn't seem related, however a word that is closely related to being clever and ends with "y" is "slyly" doesn't fit, another option is a word that means having a quick and clever mind, like "brainy" is too long, but a 5-letter word that is related to intelligence and ends with "y" is "city" doesn't seem related, however "city" has a synonym "town" doesn't fit, but a word that is related to a place where clever people meet and ends with "y" is not a good option, a better option is to think of a word that is closely related to "shrewd" and ends with "y", like "foxy".\\ \tt guess: foxy
