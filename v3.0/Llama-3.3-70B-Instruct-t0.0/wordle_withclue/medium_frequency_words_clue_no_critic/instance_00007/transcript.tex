	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: steinbrenner, to the yankees

	 explanation: The clue "steinbrenner, to the yankees" suggests a connection to the New York Yankees baseball team and its former owner George Steinbrenner. A word that comes to mind related to the Yankees or baseball is "bossy", but a more fitting word could be "owner" or a word that describes a person in charge. However, considering the context of baseball and the Yankees, a more specific guess could be related to the team or its management. Given the clue, a possible word related to the Yankees under Steinbrenner could be "owner", but since that's not a direct fit, thinking of a word that describes Steinbrenner's role or a notable aspect of the Yankees during his tenure might be more accurate. A word that is both relevant and has 5 letters could be "owner" or something closely related to the management or a figure in baseball.\\ \tt guess: owner
