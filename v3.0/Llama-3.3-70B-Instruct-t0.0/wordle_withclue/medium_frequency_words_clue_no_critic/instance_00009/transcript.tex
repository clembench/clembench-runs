	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: waffle topping

	 explanation: The clue "waffle topping" makes me think of sweet and tasty ingredients often used as waffle toppings. One common waffle topping is butter, and another is syrup, but a more specific and relevant word that comes to mind is "syrup". However, a more common and relevant 5-letter word related to waffle toppings is "maple", as in maple syrup, a popular waffle topping.\\ \tt guess: maple

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that "m", "a", "l", and "e" are incorrect, while "p" is correct but in the wrong position. Considering the clue "waffle topping" and the presence of "p", I think of other toppings that contain the letter "p". A possible 5-letter word is "peach" or other fruits, but a more relevant word that comes to mind related to waffle toppings is not as clear. However, another common waffle topping is whipped cream or fruit preserves like peach or pear, but none directly give a clear 5-letter word. A more direct guess considering "p" and waffle toppings could be related to "peach" or other fruits, but since "peach" has an "a" which is marked red, I'll consider other options like "pearl" which doesn't fit well, or think about other waffle toppings that might contain a "p". \\ \tt guess: peach

	 explanation: The feedback shows that "p" is still correct but in the wrong position, and all other letters ("e", "a", "c", "h") are incorrect. Given the clue "waffle topping" and the correct letter "p", I'll think of other waffle toppings that might contain "p". A possible topping could be related to nuts or fruits, but since "peach" didn't work out, I'll consider other options. One common waffle topping is powdered sugar, but that doesn't directly give a 5-letter word. However, thinking about sweet toppings, "honey" is not it since it doesn't have a "p", but another sweet treat that comes to mind is "syrup" which was my initial thought, but since "syrup" has some incorrect letters based on previous guesses, I'll try to think of something closer to "syrup" or other sweet waffle toppings that contain "p". A possible guess could be related to "pulp" or other sweet treats, but since none directly fit, I'll consider "plops" which doesn't seem like a real topping, or think about actual toppings that fit the 5-letter pattern and contain "p". \\ \tt guess: pulpit
