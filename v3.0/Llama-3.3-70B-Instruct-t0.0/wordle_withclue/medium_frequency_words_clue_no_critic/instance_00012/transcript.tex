	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like venture capital investments

	 explanation: The clue "like venture capital investments" suggests a word related to finance or risk. A common term associated with venture capital is "risky," but a more fitting word could be "funds" or "money." However, a five-letter word that comes to mind related to investments and risk is "betts" or "bets," which doesn't seem directly related. A better guess considering the context might be a word like "risky" doesn't fit, but "funds" does, yet it's not a perfect match. Considering investments, a word that fits is "funds."\\ \tt guess: funds

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters in "funds" except "s" are incorrect, with "s" being in the wrong position. The clue "like venture capital investments" still points towards financial terms. Considering the "s" at the end and the context, a new guess could be a word related to investments that ends with "s" and is a common term in finance, such as "stocks" or "bonds" but focusing on a five-letter word. A possible word that fits this description and includes the letter "s" is "stocks" doesn't fit the length, so looking at other options like "invest" doesn't fit either, but "money" related terms could work, like "loans."\\ \tt guess: loans

	 explanation: The feedback shows that all letters in "loans" except "s" are incorrect, with "s" again being in the wrong position. The clue "like venture capital investments" continues to suggest a financial context. Given the "s" is present but not correctly placed, and considering investment terms, a possible guess is a word that fits the financial theme and includes "s." Since "funds" and "loans" didn't work out, thinking about other investment-related terms that are five letters long and include "s," a word like "seeds" could be related to startup investments, but it seems less direct. Another option could be "specs" or terms that relate to investment specifics, but a more fitting guess considering common investment terminology could be "stake" or "stock" related terms, yet "stocks" is too long. A five-letter word that could fit is "stems" doesn't seem directly related, so focusing on the clue again, a word that could fit the description of venture capital investments and includes an "s" could be "risks."\\ \tt guess: risks

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that the letters "r," "i," "s," and "k" are all correctly placed, with only the last "s" being incorrect. The clue "like venture capital investments" suggests that the word is related to financial risk or investment risk. Given that "r," "i," "s," and "k" are all in the correct positions, and considering the context of venture capital investments, a logical guess would be to replace the incorrect "s" with a letter that fits the investment or risk theme. A possible word that comes to mind with the letters "r," "i," "s," and "k" and fits the financial risk context is "risk" related terms, but since the last letter needs to be changed, thinking of a word that is closely related to "risks" but without the "s" at the end, a possible guess could be "risk" itself doesn't fit because it's shorter, but adding a different letter at the end could work. Considering the investment theme, a word that fits could be "risky."\\ \tt guess: risky
