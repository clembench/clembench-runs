	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: virile

	 explanation: The clue "virile" suggests a word related to masculinity or strength. A common word associated with these traits is "manly", but since it's not a 5-letter word, I'll consider a related word "male" and add a suffix or prefix to make it 5 letters. One possible word is "manly" without the "y" or "male" with a suffix, but a more suitable guess would be a word that is closely related to "male" and has 5 letters, such as "males".\\ \tt guess: males

	 explanation: With the feedback, I see that "m" and "a" are in the correct position, and "l" is in the word but not in the correct position. The clue "virile" and the presence of "m" and "a" suggest a word related to masculinity. Considering the word "male" and the fact that "l" is yellow, I'll try to rearrange the letters or find a word that fits the given feedback. A possible word that comes to mind is "mails", but since "s" is red, I'll consider alternative words. Another option is to use the "mal" prefix and add letters that fit the virile clue, such as "malts" or "malty" without the "y", but a more suitable guess would be a word that is closely related to "male" and has 5 letters, such as "mails" without the "s" or "male" with a different suffix.\\ \tt guess: maleo
