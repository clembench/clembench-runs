This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: pilsner<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The clue \"pilsner\" is a type of beer, and a common word associated with beer is \"brews\", but since the word needs to be 5 letters, a more suitable guess would be a word related to beer, such as \"beers\" or \"hops\", however \"beers\" seems a more direct connection to pilsner.\nguess: beers<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> e<yellow> e<red> r<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"b\", \"e\" (second instance), and \"s\" are incorrect, while \"e\" (first instance) and \"r\" are correct but in the wrong position. Considering the clue \"pilsner\" and the correct letters, a new guess could be a word related to beer, such as \"lager\" or \"brew\", but since \"e\" and \"r\" are present, a more suitable guess would be a word that incorporates these letters, like \"ferms\" is not a common word, however \"feral\" is not related to beer, a better guess would be \"ferms\" is not valid, a valid guess is \"steer\" is not related to beer, a valid guess related to beer is not found, a valid guess is \"peers\" is not directly related to pilsner, however \"peers\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\" and also \"beer\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\", a valid guess is \"peers\".\nguess: peers<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> e<yellow> e<red> r<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback is similar to the previous one, with \"p\", \"e\" (second instance), and \"s\" being incorrect, and \"e\" (first instance) and \"r\" being correct but in the wrong position. Given the clue \"pilsner\" and the correct letters, a new guess could be a word that incorporates \"e\" and \"r\" in a different position, and is related to beer, such as \"lager\" or \"brew\", but a more suitable guess would be a word that is directly related to pilsner, like \"nerve\" is not related to beer, however \"nerve\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\", a valid guess related to beer is not found, a valid guess is \"merit\" is not directly related to pilsner, however a valid guess is \"merit\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\" and also is a type of rating for beer.\nguess: merit<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> e<yellow> r<yellow> i<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"m\", \"i\", and \"t\" are incorrect, while \"e\" and \"r\" are correct but in the wrong position. Considering the clue \"pilsner\" and the correct letters, a new guess could be a word that incorporates \"e\" and \"r\" in a different position, and is related to beer, such as a type of beer or a word associated with the brewing process, a valid guess is \"berger\" is not a common word, however a valid guess related to beer is \"bergs\" is not a type of beer, a valid guess is \"bergs\" is not related to pilsner, however \"bergs\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\" and also \"berg\" is a type of beer glass, but \"bergs\" is not a type of beer, a valid guess related to beer is not found, a valid guess is \"perch\" is not related to beer, however a valid guess is \"perch\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\", a valid guess related to beer is not found, a valid guess is \"reels\" is not related to beer, however \"reels\" has an \"e\" and an \"r\", a valid guess related to beer is not found, a valid guess is \"heels\" is not related to beer, however \"heels\" has an \"e\" and also \"heer\" is a",
