	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: court activity

	 explanation: The clue "court activity" suggests a word related to a courtroom or a tennis court. Considering the latter, a common activity in a tennis court is a "serve" or a "rally", but a more general term is "trial" which doesn't fit, however "trial" leads to think about words related to court and one word that comes to mind is "judge" doesn't fit, but another word is "court" itself which has 5 letters when considering the word "court".\\ \tt guess: court

The clue "court activity" still suggests a word related to a courtroom or a tennis court. Considering the clue and the feedback, a new guess could be a word that is related to court activities and contains the letter "u". One such word is "jury", but since "u" is in the wrong position in the previous guess, a better guess might be a word where "u" is not at the beginning or the end, a possible word is "abuse" which is related to court.\\ \tt guess: abuse

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that "a", "b", and "e" are incorrect, while "u" and "s" are correct but in the wrong position. The clue "court activity" still suggests a word related to a courtroom or a tennis court. Considering the clue and the feedback, a new guess could be a word that is related to court activities and contains the letters "u" and "s". One such word is "suits" which is related to courtroom attire, or another word could be "trous" which is not a word, but leads to think about "trials" and "lawsuits" and a possible word is "truss" which doesn't fit, but another word that comes to mind is "suits" doesn't fit because of the double "s" and "s" position, a better guess might be a word where "u" and "s" are in different positions, a possible word is "house" doesn't fit because is not directly related to court, but another word is "louse" doesn't fit, and another word is "mouse" doesn't fit, but thinking about court and the letters "u" and "s" a possible word is "abuse" was already tried, so thinking about other options a word that comes to mind is "usury" which is related to court, but is not a common word, a more common word related to court is "jury" was
