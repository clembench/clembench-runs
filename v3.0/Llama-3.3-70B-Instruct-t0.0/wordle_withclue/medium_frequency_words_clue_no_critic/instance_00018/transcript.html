        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: court activity</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 (WordGuesser) to GM (Game Master)" class="msg a-gm" style="">
        <p>explanation: The clue &quot;court activity&quot; suggests a word related to a courtroom or a tennis court. Considering the latter, a common activity in a tennis court is a &quot;serve&quot; or a &quot;rally&quot;, but a more general term is &quot;trial&quot; which doesn&#x27;t fit, however &quot;trial&quot; leads to think about words related to court and one word that comes to mind is &quot;judge&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit, but another word is &quot;court&quot; itself which has 5 letters when considering the word &quot;court&quot;.<br/>guess: court</p>

Considering the clue and the feedback, a new guess could be a word that is related to court activities and contains the letter &quot;u&quot;. One such word is &quot;jury&quot;, but since &quot;u&quot; is in the wrong position in the previous guess, a better guess might be a word where &quot;u&quot; is not at the beginning or the end, a possible word is &quot;abuse&quot; which is related to court.<br/>guess: abuse</p>
