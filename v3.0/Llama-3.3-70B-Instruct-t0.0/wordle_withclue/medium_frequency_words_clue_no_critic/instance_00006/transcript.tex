	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: like algae

	 explanation: The clue "like algae" suggests a word related to greenish aquatic plants. A common word associated with this concept is "seaweed", but since it has 6 letters, I'll consider a 5-letter alternative. The word "green" comes to mind, which fits the description and has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: green

	 explanation: The feedback indicates that all letters in the guess "green" are incorrect, so I'll start fresh with the clue "like algae". Algae are often found in ponds or lakes, which makes me think of the word "weed", but since it's not a 5-letter word, I'll consider a related word "seeds" that is associated with aquatic plants, however, another word that comes to mind is "slime" which is also related to algae.\\ \tt guess: slime

	 explanation: The feedback shows that the letters "s", "l", "i", and "m" are correct and in the right position, which is a strong indication that the word is related to "slime". Since the letter "e" is incorrect, I'll try to replace it with a letter that fits the clue "like algae" and is associated with slime. A possible word that comes to mind is "slime" without the "e" and replacing it with a similar sounding word, which leads me to the word "slimy".\\ \tt guess: slimy
