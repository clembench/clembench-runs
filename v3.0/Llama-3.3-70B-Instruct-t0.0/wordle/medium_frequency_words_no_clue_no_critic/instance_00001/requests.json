This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> e<red> a<yellow> d<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"r\", \"a\", and \"d\" being marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct position, my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different positions while introducing new letters to fill in the gaps, aiming to find a better fit or to get at least one letter in the correct position.\nguess: draft<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: d<green> r<yellow> a<green> f<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Now that \"d\" and \"a\" are in the correct positions and \"r\" is still present but not correctly placed, my next guess will keep \"d\" and \"a\" in their current positions and try to find a better fit for \"r\" while introducing new letters to replace \"f\" and \"t\", which were marked as incorrect.\nguess: drake<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: d<green> r<yellow> a<green> k<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"d\" and \"a\" still correctly placed and \"r\" remaining in the word but not in the right position, my next guess will maintain \"d\" and \"a\" while trying a different position for \"r\" and introducing new letters to replace \"k\" and \"e\", which were incorrect, aiming to utilize common letter combinations to increase the chances of a correct guess.\nguess: drain<|eot_id|>",
