This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that all letters except \"e\" are incorrect, and \"e\" is in the wrong position, so my next guess will be a word that includes \"e\" in a different position and introduces new letters that are commonly used in English words.\nguess: fence<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> e<yellow> n<red> c<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"e\" is still present but not in the correct position, and the other letters are incorrect, so my next guess will focus on placing \"e\" in a different position and introducing new letters, considering the previous attempts' results to avoid repetition.\nguess: bleak<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> e<yellow> a<yellow> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"l\", \"e\", and \"a\" are present in the word but not in the correct positions, which gives a good starting point, so my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different arrangements to find the correct word.\nguess: label<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<green> a<green> b<red> e<green> l<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"l\", \"a\", and \"e\" are in the correct positions, with \"l\" being the first letter, and \"a\" and \"e\" following, so my next guess will build on this, replacing the incorrect \"b\" and last \"l\" with new letters to complete the word.\nguess: lance<|eot_id|>",
