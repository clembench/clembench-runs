This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the letter \"a\" being marked as yellow, it means \"a\" is in the word but not in the correct position, so my next guess will include \"a\" in a different position, and I will introduce new letters that are commonly used in many English words to try and find more correct letters.\nguess: stamp<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<yellow> m<red> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The letter \"a\" is still marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the right position, so I'll try \"a\" in yet another position, and since \"s\", \"t\", \"m\", and \"p\" were incorrect, my next guess will introduce a new set of letters that are frequently used in English words, aiming to find at least one more correct letter.\nguess: awake<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> w<red> a<red> k<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The first \"a\" is still yellow, meaning it's in the word but not in the correct position, and the second \"a\" is red, indicating it's not in that position, so my next guess will place \"a\" in a different position again and introduce new letters, avoiding \"w\", \"k\", and \"e\" since they were marked as red, to try and find more correct letters.\nguess: angel<|eot_id|>",
