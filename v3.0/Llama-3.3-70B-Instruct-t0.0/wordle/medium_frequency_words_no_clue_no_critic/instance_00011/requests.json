This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the letter \"a\" being marked as yellow, it means \"a\" is in the word but not in the correct position, so my next guess will include \"a\" in a different position, and I will introduce new letters that are commonly used in many English words to try and find more correct letters.\nguess: stamp<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> a<yellow> m<red> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Both \"a\" and \"t\" are marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct positions, so my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different positions, and introduce new letters that often appear together with \"a\" and \"t\" in English words to increase the chances of finding more correct letters.\nguess: taste<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<green> s<red> t<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"a\" now marked as green, it means \"a\" is in the correct position, and \"t\" is still marked as yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the right spot, so my next guess will keep \"a\" in the same position and try different positions for \"t\" while introducing new letters that could fit well with \"a\" and \"t\" in a word.\nguess: taunt<|eot_id|>",
