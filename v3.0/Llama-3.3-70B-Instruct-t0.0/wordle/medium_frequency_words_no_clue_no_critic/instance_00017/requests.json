You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> e<red> a<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the letter \"a\" being marked as yellow, it means \"a\" is in the word but not in the correct position, so my next guess will include \"a\" in a different position, and I will introduce new letters that are commonly used in many English words to try and find more correct letters.\nguess: stamp<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<yellow> m<yellow> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Both \"a\" and \"m\" are marked as yellow, indicating they are in the word but not in the correct positions, so my next guess will try to utilize these letters in different positions and introduce new letters that are frequently paired with \"a\" and \"m\" in English words to increase the chances of finding more correct letters or their correct positions.\nguess: amend<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> m<yellow> e<red> n<yellow> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"a\", \"m\", and \"n\" all marked as yellow, my next guess will attempt to place these letters in their correct positions by trying different combinations, and I will also introduce a new letter that is commonly used in words containing these letters to see if I can find a correct placement or an additional correct letter.\nguess: manor<|eot_id|>",
