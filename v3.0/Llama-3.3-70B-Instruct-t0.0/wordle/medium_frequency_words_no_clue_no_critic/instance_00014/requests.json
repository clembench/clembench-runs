This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, my next guess will be a completely new set of letters, choosing a word that is also very common and has a different combination of vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting at least one correct letter.\nguess: bread<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<green> e<red> a<red> d<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"r\" and \"d\" being correct, my next guess will focus on words that contain these letters, preferably in the same positions, and introduce new vowels and consonants to fill in the gaps, aiming to utilize the green letters as anchors.\nguess: gridy<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game.
