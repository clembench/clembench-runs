This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" are incorrect, but the letter \"e\" is correct and in the right position, so I'll build upon this by guessing a new word that ends with \"e\" and introduces new letters.\nguess: glove<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<green> o<red> v<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"g\", \"o\", and \"v\" are incorrect, but \"l\" is correct and in the wrong position, and \"e\" remains correct and in the right position, so my next guess will retain \"l\" and \"e\", and try new letters.\nguess: flute<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> l<green> u<red> t<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"f\" and \"l\" are now both correct and in the right positions, and \"e\" remains correct, while \"u\" and \"t\" are incorrect, so my next guess will build on the correct letters \"f\", \"l\", and \"e\" and introduce new letters to fill the remaining slots.\nguess: flesh<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<green> l<green> e<yellow> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"f\" and \"l\" are still correct and in the right positions, but \"e\" has moved to a wrong position, and \"s\" and \"h\" are incorrect, so my next guess will try to utilize the correct letters \"f\" and \"l\", and the letter \"e\" in a different position, while introducing new letters.\nguess: fleet<|eot_id|>",
