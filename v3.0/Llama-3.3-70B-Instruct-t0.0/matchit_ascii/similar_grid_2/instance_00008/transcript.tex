	 ANSWER: The ▢'s in the third and fourth rows of my grid are only in the first column, there are no additional ▢'s in those rows beyond just the first column, the rest of the squares in those rows are filled with X's.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given that the first column of your grid has a mix of X's and ▢'s, and the rest of the grid, except for the last row, is filled with X's, can you confirm that the number of X's in the first column of your grid is 1, and the number of ▢'s in the first column is 3, with the ▢'s being in the rows below the row with the X in the first column that is part of a completely filled row of X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 ANSWER: Yes, I can confirm that the number of X's in the first column of my grid is 4, and the number of ▢'s in the first column is 1, with the ▢ being in the last row, but considering the description of the grid provided, I realize that my grid matches the description provided, with 4 X's in the first column of the top 4 rows, and the rest of the grid, except for the last row, filled with X's, and the last row being completely empty.\\ \tt DECISION: same grid
