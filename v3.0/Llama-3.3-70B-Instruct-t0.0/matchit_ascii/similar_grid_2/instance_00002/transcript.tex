	 ANSWER: The second row in my grid has a single ▢, but unlike the uniform pattern of X X ▢ X X that you described for your grid, the second row in my grid has the pattern X X ▢ X X, which is similar, but I must correct myself, the actual pattern for the second row in my grid is indeed X X ▢ X X, with the ▢ in the third column, no, the correct pattern is X X ▢ X X with the ▢ in the third column, I made another error, the correct pattern for the second row is indeed X X ▢ X X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision.

Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
