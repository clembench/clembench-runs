Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The ▢'s in my grid are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, with two ▢'s in each of the middle three rows, one on the left and one on the right, and X's in between and on the edges.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are rows in my grid that have only X's, with no ▢'s at all, specifically the first and last rows. Additionally, there are no rows in my grid with only one ▢, all the rows with ▢'s have two ▢'s, one on the left and one on the right, arranged symmetrically.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.
