	 ANSWER: You are correct that I initially described the grid as having only one ▢ in each of the second, third, and fourth rows, but I made a mistake when I described the fourth row, it actually has two ▢'s, one in the second column and one in the fourth column, so the correct pattern is that the second row has one ▢, the third row has one ▢, and the fourth row has two ▢'s, which breaks the "one ▢ per row" pattern I initially described.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given that your grid has a solid border of X's on the edges, and a symmetrical pattern of ▢'s in the middle rows, do you think it's likely that our grids are the same, or are there still some significant differences that could mean they are not identical?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 ANSWER: Given the differences we've discussed, including the asymmetrical and varying placement of ▢'s in your grid, versus the symmetrical and consistent pattern in my grid, I think it's unlikely that our grids are the same.\\ \tt DECISION: different grids
