	 ANSWER: My grid does not have any instances where a single empty square is completely surrounded by filled squares on all four sides, the empty squares are always adjacent to at least one other empty square or the edge of the grid, and regarding the rows, there are rows that have the same number of filled squares as another row, specifically, there are two rows with 3 filled squares and two rows with 2 filled squares are not present but two rows have 3 X's, and the positions of the filled squares in the rows with the same number of filled squares are not identical, they are different, the X's are in different positions in the rows with 3 X's.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are there any instances in your grid where two or more empty squares (▢) are adjacent to each other vertically, forming a vertical sequence of empty squares, and if so, what is the maximum length of such a vertical sequence of empty squares in your grid? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.

	 ANSWER: In my grid, there are instances where two empty squares (▢) are adjacent to each other vertically, but there are no instances where three or more empty squares are adjacent to each other vertically, the maximum length of a vertical sequence of empty squares in my grid is 2, and this occurs in one column where two empty squares are stacked on top of each other, and there are no other columns with more than one empty square adjacent vertically.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any instances where a filled square (X) is isolated, meaning it is not adjacent to any other filled square (X) horizontally or vertically, and if so, how many isolated filled squares are there in your grid?
