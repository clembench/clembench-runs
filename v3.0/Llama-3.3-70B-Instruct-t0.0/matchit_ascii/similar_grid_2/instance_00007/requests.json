Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, my grid does not have a row that consists entirely of blank squares, with no X's present in that row. The top row of my grid contains 2 X's, which are positioned at the edges of the row, one at the start and one at the end.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The second row of my grid contains 2 X's, and they are not positioned in a similar way to the X's in the second row of your grid, as they are closer to the center and to each other. There are no X's in my grid that are completely isolated, meaning surrounded on all four sides by blank squares, as all X's have at least one adjacent X or are at the edge of the grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?
