        <p>ANSWER: No, the arrangement of X&#x27;s and ▢&#x27;s in the second and third rows of my grid is not the same as the arrangement of X&#x27;s and ▢&#x27;s in the second and third rows of your grid, the second row of my grid has two ▢&#x27;s at the first and second positions, followed by three X&#x27;s, whereas the second row of your grid is completely filled with X&#x27;s, and the third row of my grid has two ▢&#x27;s at the first and last positions, with an X in the middle, which is similar to the third row of your grid. As for patterns or symmetries, my grid does not have any rotational symmetry, but it does have reflection symmetry around the middle column, since the first and last rows are identical, and the second and fourth rows are not identical but have a similar pattern of X&#x27;s and ▢&#x27;s, however, the grid as a whole does not have perfect reflection symmetry due to the arrangement of X&#x27;s and ▢&#x27;s in the second and third rows.<br/>Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write &quot;DECISION: same grid&quot; if you think they are the same grid or &quot;DECISION: different grids&quot; if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<br/></p>
