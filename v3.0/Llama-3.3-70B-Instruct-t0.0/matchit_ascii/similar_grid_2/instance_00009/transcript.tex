	 ANSWER: Yes, the two ▢'s in the third row of my grid are symmetrically arranged around the middle column of the grid, with an X in the middle position of that row, and there are no other ▢'s in my grid besides the ones in the third row, the rest of the grid is filled with X's, except for the two ▢'s in the third row, which are at the first and last positions of that row, and the X in the middle position of the third row.\\ \tt QUESTION: Is the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the second and third rows of your grid the same as the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the second and third rows of my grid, considering the positions of the ▢'s and X's that you described earlier?\\ \tt QUESTION: Are there any specific patterns or symmetries in the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in your grid, such as rotational symmetry, reflection symmetry, or any other type of symmetry, that are not immediately apparent from the descriptions we have exchanged so far? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.

	 ANSWER: No, the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the second and third rows of my grid is not the same as the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the second and third rows of your grid, the second row of my grid has two ▢'s at the first and second positions, followed by three X's, whereas the second row of your grid is completely filled with X's, and the third row of my grid has two ▢'s at the first and last positions, with an X in the middle, which is similar to the third row of your grid. As for patterns or symmetries, my grid does not have any rotational symmetry, but it does have reflection symmetry around the middle column, since the first and last rows are identical, and the second and fourth rows are not identical but have a similar pattern of X's and ▢'s, however, the grid as a whole does not have perfect reflection symmetry due to the arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the second and third rows.
