The two ▢'s in the second row of my grid are adjacent to each other, and they are at the first and second positions of the row, and the X's in the second row are adjacent to the ▢'s, they are at the last three positions of the row, so the ▢'s and the X's in the second row are separated by being at different parts of the row, but they are adjacent in the sense that there are no other ▢'s between the ▢'s and the X's are at the end of the row, the ▢'s are at the beginning of the row.\nQUESTION: Are the two ▢'s in the third row of your grid, which you mentioned are at the first and last positions of that row, symmetrically arranged around the middle column of the grid, with an X in the middle position of that row, and are there any other ▢'s in your grid besides the ones in the third row?
