	 ANSWER: Yes, there is a row in my grid, other than the first row, where the number of filled squares (X's) is less than 4, specifically the third row, which has only 2 X's at the end, and also the second row has only 3 X's, so both the second and third rows have less than 4 filled squares.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
