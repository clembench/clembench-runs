	 ANSWER: No, my grid does not have any perfect symmetry, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as the distribution of X's and ▢'s is not identical when reflected or rotated, although there are some limited patterns and repetitions, the overall arrangement of X's and ▢'s does not exhibit mirror symmetry or rotational symmetry, and the presence of X's in specific columns and rows breaks any potential symmetry.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
