Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, my grid does not have any perfect symmetry, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as the distribution of X's and ▢'s is not identical when reflected or rotated, although there are some limited patterns and repetitions, the overall arrangement of X's and ▢'s does not exhibit mirror symmetry or rotational symmetry, and the presence of X's in specific columns and rows breaks any potential symmetry.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow come to a decision.
