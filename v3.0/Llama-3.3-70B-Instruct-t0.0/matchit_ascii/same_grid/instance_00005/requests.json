Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: My grid has rows where the empty squares are isolated, meaning they are not adjacent to any other empty squares in the same row, and also rows where the empty squares are paired together, so there is a mix of both isolated and paired empty squares in different rows of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow come to a decision.
