	 ANSWER: My grid has rows where the empty squares are isolated, meaning they are not adjacent to any other empty squares in the same row, and also rows where the empty squares are paired together, so there is a mix of both isolated and paired empty squares in different rows of my grid.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
