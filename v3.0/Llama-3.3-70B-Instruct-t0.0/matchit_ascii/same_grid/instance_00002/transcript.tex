	 ANSWER: No, there is nothing, no matter how minor, that I haven't mentioned yet about my grid that could potentially distinguish it from your grid, as our conversation has thoroughly covered all aspects, including the arrangement of X's and ▢'s, row by row, and no hidden patterns, errors in description, or other distinguishing characteristics have been omitted from my descriptions and answers.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
