	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has the same total number of filled squares, including both the "X" symbols and any filled squares in the first column, as your grid, with 4 filled squares in the first column and 16 "X" symbols in the top 4 rows, excluding the first column, resulting in a total of 20 filled squares.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
