Regarding the dimensions and overall structure, yes, my grid is also a 5x5 grid with the third row being the distinctive one, and the rows and columns are positioned relative to each other in the same way as described for your grid.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.

Additionally, there are no other unique features or patterns in my grid beyond the symmetrical arrangement of X's and ▢'s in the third row, with the X's filling all the other rows and columns uniformly, except for the two ▢'s in the third row.\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid, excluding the third row, arranged in a perfect fill, meaning that every cell in the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows is filled with an X, with no gaps or empty cells?
