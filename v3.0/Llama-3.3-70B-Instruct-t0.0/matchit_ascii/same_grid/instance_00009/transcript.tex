	 ANSWER: Based on the information shared, it seems likely that our grids are identical, given the matching descriptions of the symmetrical arrangement in the third row, the perfect fill of X's in the other rows, and the use of the ▢ symbol for the blank squares. Regarding the dimensions and overall structure, yes, my grid is also a 5x5 grid with the third row being the distinctive one, and the rows and columns are positioned relative to each other in the same way as described for your grid.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
