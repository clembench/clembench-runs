	 ANSWER: Yes, the individual ▢'s in my grid, particularly those in the same column, are identical in terms of their position and arrangement, meaning that if you were to superimpose your grid over mine, the ▢'s would perfectly align and match, with no deviations or discrepancies in their placement, which further suggests that our grids are likely identical.\\ \tt QUESTION: Given the high degree of similarity and matching patterns between our grids, is it possible to conclude that our grids are indeed the same, or are there still any potential differences or uncertainties that could be explored to confirm their identity?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
