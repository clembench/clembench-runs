Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has one row that is completely empty, which is the first row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any columns where all the squares are filled (X), and if so, how many such columns are there?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has four columns where all the squares are filled (X), which are the second, third, fourth, and fifth columns, since the first column has empty squares in all rows except the second, fourth, and fifth rows are empty in the first column but the rest of the columns have all squares filled.\nQUESTION: Are the filled squares (X) in the third row of your grid located at the very end of the row, meaning they occupy the fourth and fifth columns? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the filled squares (X) in the third row of my grid are located at the very end of the row, meaning they occupy the fourth and fifth columns.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the empty squares (▢) in the second, fourth, and fifth rows of your grid all located in the same column, specifically the first column?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the empty squares (▢) in the second, fourth, and fifth rows of my grid are all located in the same column, specifically the first column.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDECISION: same grid<|eot_id|>",
