        <p>ANSWER: The X&#x27;s in my grid are primarily located along the edges, but they also occupy some inner cells, and their distribution is not entirely random, as they seem to be forming a sort of diagonal boundary that separates the X&#x27;s from the ▢&#x27;s, with the ▢&#x27;s being more concentrated in the bottom-right corner and the X&#x27;s being more prevalent in the top-left area, and there is a noticeable diagonal line of X&#x27;s that stretches from the top-left to the bottom-right, but with some ▢&#x27;s interrupting this line.</p>
