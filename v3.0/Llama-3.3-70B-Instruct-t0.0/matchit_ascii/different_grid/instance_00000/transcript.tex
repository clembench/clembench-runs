	 ANSWER: The first row is the only row in my grid with all ▢'s, as the other rows have a mix of X's and ▢'s, and the arrangement of ▢'s and X's in the other rows is such that the ▢'s are mostly concentrated in the first column and the X's are concentrated in the rest of the columns, with the exception of the second row which has four X's at the end, and the third row which has two X's at the end, and the fourth and fifth rows which have four X's each, with the ▢'s being only in the first column of these rows.\\ \tt QUESTION: How many ▢'s are in the second row of your grid, and are they all concentrated in the first column, or are they scattered throughout the row?
