Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The X's in my grid are indeed limited to only the second and fourth columns, but only in the middle three rows, and the first, third, and fifth columns in those rows are filled with blank squares, while the first and last rows are completely filled with blank squares, with no X's at all. \nQUESTION: Does your grid have any completely blank rows, with no X's, similar to the top and bottom rows in my grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid completely surrounding the diagonal line of blank squares, meaning that every row has X's on either side of the blank square, with no blank squares adjacent to the edges of the grid except for the diagonal blank squares themselves?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: My grid does not have any completely blank rows with no X's, every row has a mix of X's and a single blank square, and the X's are surrounding the blank squares, with every blank square having X's on either side, except for the edges of the grid, where the blank square is adjacent to the edge, and there are no other blank squares adjacent to the edges of the grid except for the diagonal blank squares themselves.\nQUESTION: Are the blank squares in the corners of your grid part of a larger solid border of blank squares that surrounds the entire grid, or are they isolated blank squares with X's adjacent to them on the edges of the grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The blank squares in the corners of my grid are part of a larger solid border of blank squares that surrounds the entire grid, with the top and bottom rows being completely filled with blank squares, and the first and last columns also being completely filled with blank squares, effectively creating a border around the inner X-filled area.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a symmetrical pattern, where the arrangement of X's and blank squares is mirrored on either side of the central column or row, or is the pattern asymmetrical?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The middle row of my grid has an X in the second column and an X in the fourth column, with blank squares in the other columns, and this arrangement is consistent with the middle three rows, which all have X's in the second and fourth columns, and the specific arrangement of X's in the second and fourth columns is the same in all three middle rows, with no blank squares in those columns, and this creates a consistent pattern of alternating X's in those columns across the middle three rows.\nQUESTION: Does the diagonal line of blank squares in your grid intersect with the middle row of the grid, and if so, does it affect the arrangement of X's and blank squares in that row, or is the diagonal line positioned in a way that avoids the middle row altogether?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow come to a decision.
