	 ANSWER: Yes, there are several pairs of adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically) in my grid where one square is filled (X) and the other square is empty (▢), and after counting, I found that there are a total of 12 such pairs in my grid, with 6 pairs being horizontal and 6 pairs being vertical.\\ \tt QUESTION: You mentioned that the X's in the third and fourth position of the middle column are part of a larger group of X's that are together, does this larger group of X's extend to the rows above or below the third row, which you mentioned is completely filled?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 ANSWER: Yes, the larger group of X's extends to the rows above and below the third row, specifically to the second and fourth rows, where the X's in the middle column are part of a larger group of 2 X's that are together horizontally in those rows.\\ \tt DECISION: different grids
