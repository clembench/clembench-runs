        <p>ANSWER: The stair-step pattern of ▢&#x27;s in my grid is consistent and predictable, with no irregularities or exceptions, and the pattern holds true throughout the entire grid, with each row having one more ▢ than the row above it, and the X&#x27;s filling in the rest of the space, and there are no rows or columns where the ▢&#x27;s are shifted or the X&#x27;s are interrupted, and the pattern is uniform and consistent, with the ▢&#x27;s always being to the left of the X&#x27;s in each row, and the X&#x27;s always being to the right of the ▢&#x27;s, and below the ▢&#x27;s in the rows above. Additionally, there are no rows or columns in my grid where the number of ▢&#x27;s is greater than the number of X&#x27;s, and the X&#x27;s are always more numerous than the ▢&#x27;s in every row and column, with the exception of the fact that the number of ▢&#x27;s increases as you move down the rows, and the number of X&#x27;s decreases as you move down the rows, but the X&#x27;s are always more numerous than the ▢&#x27;s in every row, and the relative frequencies of ▢&#x27;s and X&#x27;s vary across different parts of the grid, with the X&#x27;s being more frequent in the top rows and the ▢&#x27;s being more frequent in the bottom rows, but the X&#x27;s are always more numerous overall.<br/>Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write &quot;DECISION: same grid&quot; if you think they are the same grid or &quot;DECISION: different grids&quot; if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<br/></p>
