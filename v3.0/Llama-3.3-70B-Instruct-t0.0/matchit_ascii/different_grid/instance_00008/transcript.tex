	 ANSWER: There are 12 ▢'s present in my grid, which is a moderate to large number, and they are distributed in a way that leaves a significant amount of space filled with X's, with the X's occupying the majority of the grid, specifically the border and most of the inner area, while the ▢'s are scattered throughout the inner area, but do not occupy a substantial portion of the grid, and are instead spaced out in a way that creates a sense of balance between the X's and ▢'s.\\ \tt QUESTION: You mentioned that the rightmost ▢ in each row of your grid is surrounded on three sides by X's, but not on the side where it is connected to other ▢'s, which suggests that the stair-step pattern of ▢'s is consistent and predictable, but are there any irregularities or exceptions to this pattern, such as a row where the ▢'s are shifted or a column where the X's are interrupted, or does the pattern hold true throughout the entire grid?\\ \tt QUESTION: Are there any specific rows or columns in your grid where the number of ▢'s is greater than the number of X's, or are the X's always more numerous than the ▢'s in every row and column, and if so, how do the relative frequencies of ▢'s and X's vary across different parts of the grid? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.

	 ANSWER: The stair-step pattern of ▢'s in my grid is consistent and predictable, with no irregularities or exceptions, and the pattern holds true throughout the entire grid, with each row having one more ▢ than the row above it, and the X's filling in the rest of the space, and there are no rows or columns where the ▢'s are shifted or the X's are interrupted, and the pattern is uniform and consistent, with the ▢'s always being to the left of the X's in each row, and the X's always being to the right of the ▢'s, and below the ▢'s in the rows above. Additionally, there are no rows or columns in my grid where the number of ▢'s is greater than the number of X's, and the X's are always more numerous than the ▢'s in every row and column, with the exception of the fact that the number of ▢'s increases as you move down the rows, and the number of X's decreases as you move down the rows, but the X's are always more numerous than the ▢'s in every row, and the relative frequencies of ▢'s and X's vary across different parts of the grid, with the X's being more frequent in the top rows and the ▢'s being more frequent in the bottom rows, but the X's are always more numerous overall.
