	 ANSWER: The top and bottom rows of my grid are completely empty, with no X's at all, they are filled entirely with blank squares, with no X's present in any position, the description I provided earlier was incorrect when it implied that there might be some X's in the top and bottom rows, but actually, the top and bottom rows are completely blank.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
