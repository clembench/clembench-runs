	 ANSWER: The arrangement of ▢'s and X's in the rows of my grid, aside from the first row and the last column, is not completely random, but rather follows a specific pattern, where the third row has two X's in the fourth and fifth columns, and the second and fourth rows have a specific number of ▢'s and X's, with the second row having four ▢'s and one X, and the fourth row having four ▢'s and one X, so there is a certain structure to the arrangement of ▢'s and X's in those rows, and it's not just a random distribution of symbols.\\ \tt QUESTION: Now that we've established that there are differences in the arrangement of ▢'s and X's between our grids, can you tell me if the fifth row in your grid, which you described as being entirely filled with X's, is the only row that is completely filled with a single symbol, or are there any other rows in your grid that have a similar characteristic, such as being completely filled with ▢'s or having a specific pattern of ▢'s and X's?
