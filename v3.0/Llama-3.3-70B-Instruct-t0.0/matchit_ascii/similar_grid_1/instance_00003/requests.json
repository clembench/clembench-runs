Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the X's in your grid limited to the top row, the middle column, and possibly other specific areas, or are there any X's scattered randomly or in other patterns throughout the rest of the grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The X's in my grid are not scattered randomly, but are instead limited to the top row and the middle column, with no other X's outside of these areas, and the rest of the grid is filled with ▢'s in a symmetrical pattern around the middle column.\nQUESTION: You mentioned that the bottom row of your grid is completely filled with X's, but what about the row above it, does it have any ▢'s, or is it also mostly or entirely filled with X's? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The row above the bottom row in my grid, which is the fourth row, has X's in the middle three columns, but it also has ▢'s in the first and last columns, so it is not entirely filled with X's, whereas the bottom row is completely filled with X's.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: You mentioned that the first and last columns of your grid have ▢'s on all but the top row, which implies that the top row is an exception, but you also mentioned that the top row is completely filled with X's, so does that mean that the first and last columns do have X's in the top row, or are there any ▢'s in the top row at all?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, the first and last columns of my grid do have X's in the top row, and there are no ▢'s in the top row at all, it is a solid row of X's from the first column to the last column, which is why the first and last columns are exceptions to the otherwise mostly ▢'s in those columns.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.

Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.
