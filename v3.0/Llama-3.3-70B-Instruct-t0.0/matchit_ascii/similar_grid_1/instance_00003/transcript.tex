	 ANSWER: Yes, the first and last columns of my grid do have X's in the top row, and there are no ▢'s in the top row at all, it is a solid row of X's from the first column to the last column, which is why the first and last columns are exceptions to the otherwise mostly ▢'s in those columns.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
