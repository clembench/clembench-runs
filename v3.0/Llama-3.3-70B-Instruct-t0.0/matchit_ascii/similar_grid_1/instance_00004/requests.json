ANSWER: No, my grid does not have any columns where all the cells are ▢'s, as each column contains at least one X.\nQUESTION: Are there any columns in your grid where the X's are placed at the top and bottom, with ▢'s in the middle three rows, creating a kind of \"frame\" effect with the X's at the edges of the grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, my grid has columns where the X's are placed at the top and bottom, with ▢'s in the middle three rows, which matches the \"frame\" effect you described, and this pattern occurs in the first and last columns of my grid.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a row where there are two consecutive X's, and if so, is this row located at the top, middle, or bottom part of the grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

ANSWER: No, the X's in my grid do not create a vertical symmetry, as the left and right halves of the grid are not mirror images of each other when folded in half vertically, due to the unique placement of X's and ▢'s in each column.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have a specific number of X's that is the same in each row, or does the number of X's vary from row to row, and if it varies, is there a particular pattern or sequence to the number of X's in each row?
