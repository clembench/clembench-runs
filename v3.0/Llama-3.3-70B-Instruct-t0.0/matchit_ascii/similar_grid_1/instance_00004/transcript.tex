	 ANSWER: The number of X's in my grid varies from row to row, and there is a specific pattern to the number of X's in each row, with some rows having 2 X's, some having 3 X's, and the number of X's being consistent with the pattern shown in the original grid description, but not following a simple arithmetic sequence.\\ \tt QUESTION: Does your grid have any rows where the X's are placed at the edges, with ▢'s filling the inner cells, and if so, are these rows located at the top, bottom, or somewhere in the middle of the grid?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 ANSWER: Yes, my grid has rows where the X's are placed at the edges, with ▢'s filling the inner cells, and these rows are located at the top and bottom of the grid, as well as the fifth row having X's at the edges but with two X's at the end.\\ \tt DECISION: same grid
