Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are rows in my grid where all the inner cells are ▢'s, with no X's in between them, specifically the first and last rows, and also the fifth row if considering the pattern, all have inner cells as ▢'s with X's only on the borders.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

There are no rows without any X's inside, except for those on the border, but there are columns where this is the case. The X's inside the grid are limited and seem to follow a specific pattern rather than being completely random, with one row having an X in the middle and another row having two X's that are adjacent. \nQUESTION: Are the inner X's in your grid limited to just one or two rows, or are they spread across more rows, and do any of the inner X's appear in the same column as each other?\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any instances where two X's are directly adjacent to each other, either horizontally or vertically, in the inner area, not including the border X's?

Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The X's inside my grid, not on the border, are not placed symmetrically, and their placement appears to be deliberate but not following a simple symmetry. There are no rows without any X's inside, except for those on the border, but there are columns where this is the case. The X's inside the grid are limited and seem to follow a specific pattern rather than being completely random, with one row having an X in the middle and another row having two X's that are adjacent. \nQUESTION: Are the inner X's in your grid limited to just one or two rows, or are they spread across more rows, and do any of the inner X's appear in the same column as each other?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Regarding the second question, yes, my grid does have instances where two X's are directly adjacent to each other, specifically horizontally, in the inner area, not including the border X's, as seen in the second row where there are two adjacent X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any instances in your grid where an inner X is completely surrounded by empty squares, having no adjacent X's either horizontally or vertically, and if so, how many such instances exist in your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is an instance in my grid where an inner X is completely surrounded by empty squares, having no adjacent X's either horizontally or vertically. This instance occurs once in the third row, where the single inner X is surrounded by ▢'s on all four sides. \nQUESTION: Does your grid have the same number of inner X's as my grid, and are the positions of the inner X's in your grid similar to the ones in my description, particularly the row with an X in the middle and the row with two adjacent X's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

Specifically, my grid does not have a row with a single X in the middle that is surrounded by ▢'s on all four sides as you described for the third row. Additionally, the row with two adjacent X's in my grid is present, but the overall arrangement and number of inner X's differ from your grid, including the specific instances you mentioned for the third and other rows.\nQUESTION: Considering the rows and columns without any inner X's, as you mentioned there are columns with this characteristic, are these columns completely empty of inner X's throughout the entire grid, meaning no inner X's appear in these columns at all, or are there specific rows where inner X's do appear in these otherwise empty columns? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The columns I mentioned as having no inner X's, except for the border X's, indeed have no inner X's throughout the entire grid, meaning no inner X's appear in these columns at all, not even in a single row. These columns are completely empty of inner X's, with only the border X's present at the top and bottom. \nQUESTION: Given the differences in the number and arrangement of inner X's between our grids, are there any specific patterns or features in your grid that are preserved or consistent, such as the presence of inner X's in specific columns or rows, or any notable symmetries or asymmetries in the arrangement of the inner X's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow come to a decision.
