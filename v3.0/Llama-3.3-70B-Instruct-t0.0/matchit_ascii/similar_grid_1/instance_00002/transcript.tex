	 ANSWER: The columns I mentioned as having no inner X's, except for the border X's, indeed have no inner X's throughout the entire grid, meaning no inner X's appear in these columns at all, not even in a single row. These columns are completely empty of inner X's, with only the border X's present at the top and bottom. \\ \tt QUESTION: Given the differences in the number and arrangement of inner X's between our grids, are there any specific patterns or features in your grid that are preserved or consistent, such as the presence of inner X's in specific columns or rows, or any notable symmetries or asymmetries in the arrangement of the inner X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
