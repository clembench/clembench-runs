        <p>ANSWER: The X&#x27;s inside my grid, not on the border, are not placed symmetrically, and their placement appears to be deliberate but not following a simple symmetry. There are no rows without any X&#x27;s inside, except for those on the border, but there are columns where this is the case. The X&#x27;s inside the grid are limited and seem to follow a specific pattern rather than being completely random, with one row having an X in the middle and another row having two X&#x27;s that are adjacent. <br/>QUESTION: Are the inner X&#x27;s in your grid limited to just one or two rows, or are they spread across more rows, and do any of the inner X&#x27;s appear in the same column as each other?</p>
