	 ANSWER: In my grid, there are no rows where the ▢ is positioned at the same column as the ▢ in the row directly above or below it, the ▢ always moves to a different column in each subsequent row, and since the ▢ moves down the columns, each row has the ▢ in a unique column, with no column having the ▢ in more than one row.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
