	 ANSWER: The second and fourth rows of my grid each have four blank squares, and they are contiguous, filling the last four columns of those rows, with a single X in the first column of each row, so the blank squares are separated from the X by being in different columns, and it seems that this arrangement might match the arrangement of ▢'s in the corresponding rows of your grid, given that you mentioned the ▢'s are mostly concentrated in the middle three columns, but I'm not sure if the exact positions match.\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the first and last rows of your grid, which are completely filled with X's, a unique feature of your grid, or could this also be a possible arrangement in my grid, given that my original description mentioned the first column being filled with X's, but didn't explicitly state that the first row was completely filled with X's?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
