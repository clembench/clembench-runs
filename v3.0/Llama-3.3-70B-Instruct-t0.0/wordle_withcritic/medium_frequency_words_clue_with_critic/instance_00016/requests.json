The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter.

And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: shrewd<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The word \"shrewd\" means having keen discernment and good judgment, which is often associated with being clever or cunning. A word that comes to mind related to this concept is \"smart\", but since it has only 5 letters, it could be a potential fit.\nguess: smart<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the given guess \"smart\" has the same number of letters as required and is related to the concept of being clever, which aligns with the meaning of \"shrewd\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with the guess \"smart\" and its relation to being clever, the next step is to consider other words that convey a similar meaning. A word that is synonymous with \"smart\" and also has 5 letters is \"slyly\", but a more common 5-letter word related to cleverness is \"sharp\" and another one is \"craft\", however \"sharp\" seems to be a better fit.\nguess: sharp<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> a<yellow> r<red> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that \"a\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters being red, the next guess should utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" is \"wager\", but another option could be \"awake\" or \"aware\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive.\nguess: awake<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"awake\" incorporates the letter \"a\" which is indicated as a correct letter in the wrong position, and it also aligns with the concept of being perceptive or clever, which is related to the clue \"shrewd\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"awake\" and the clue \"shrewd\", the next guess should continue to utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters that fit the concept of being clever or perceptive. A word that aligns with this concept and has 5 letters is \"aware\", which also includes the letter \"a\" and conveys a sense of being sharp or astute.\nguess: aware<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> w<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that only the first \"a\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters being red, the next guess should utilize the letter \"a\" in a different position and explore other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" in a potentially correct position is \"craft\", but another option could be \"brash\" or \"slash\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive, however \"brash\" seems to be a better fit given the letter \"a\" placement.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"brash\" utilizes the letter \"a\" in a different position, as suggested by the feedback, and it also conveys a sense of being perceptive or clever, aligning with the clue \"shrewd\", and considering the previous feedback, \"brash\" seems like a plausible fit.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"brash\" and considering it as a plausible fit, the next step is to assess if \"brash\" could indeed be the target word or if it needs further adjustment. Since \"brash\" aligns well with the clue \"shrewd\" and utilizes the letter \"a\" in a potentially correct position based on the feedback, it's reasonable to consider \"brash\" as a strong candidate. However, without explicit confirmation, another word that also fits the description and is similar to \"brash\" in conveying cleverness is \"brush\", but given the strength of \"brash\" as a candidate, it might be worth exploring minor adjustments or closely related words.\nguess: brush<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> u<red> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that all letters in \"brush\" are red, indicating none of them are in the correct word, and considering the previous agreement with \"brash\", it seems that \"brash\" itself might be worth re-examining as a potential solution since the feedback on \"brush\" does not provide any new letters to work with. The clue \"shrewd\" and the previous feedback suggest that \"brash\" could indeed be a strong fit, and without any new information to contradict this, it's reasonable to revisit \"brash\" as a possible answer.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|>",

A word that comes to mind related to this concept is \"smart\", but since it has only 5 letters, it could be a potential fit.\nguess: smart<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the given guess \"smart\" has the same number of letters as required and is related to the concept of being clever, which aligns with the meaning of \"shrewd\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with the guess \"smart\" and its relation to being clever, the next step is to consider other words that convey a similar meaning. A word that is synonymous with \"smart\" and also has 5 letters is \"slyly\", but a more common 5-letter word related to cleverness is \"sharp\" and another one is \"craft\", however \"sharp\" seems to be a better fit.\nguess: sharp<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> a<yellow> r<red> p<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that \"a\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters being red, the next guess should utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" is \"wager\", but another option could be \"awake\" or \"aware\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive.\nguess: awake<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"awake\" incorporates the letter \"a\" which is indicated as a correct letter in the wrong position, and it also aligns with the concept of being perceptive or clever, which is related to the clue \"shrewd\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"awake\" and the clue \"shrewd\", the next guess should continue to utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters that fit the concept of being clever or perceptive. A word that aligns with this concept and has 5 letters is \"aware\", which also includes the letter \"a\" and conveys a sense of being sharp or astute.\nguess: aware<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> w<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that only the first \"a\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters being red, the next guess should utilize the letter \"a\" in a different position and explore other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" in a potentially correct position is \"craft\", but another option could be \"brash\" or \"slash\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive, however \"brash\" seems to be a better fit given the letter \"a\" placement.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"brash\" utilizes the letter \"a\" in a different position, as suggested by the feedback, and it also conveys a sense of being perceptive or clever, aligning with the clue \"shrewd\", and considering the previous feedback, \"brash\" seems like a plausible fit.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"brash\" and considering it as a plausible fit, the next step is to assess if \"brash\" could indeed be the target word or if it needs further adjustment. Since \"brash\" aligns well with the clue \"shrewd\" and utilizes the letter \"a\" in a potentially correct position based on the feedback, it's reasonable to consider \"brash\" as a strong candidate. However, without explicit confirmation, another word that also fits the description and is similar to \"brash\" in conveying cleverness is \"brush\", but given the strength of \"brash\" as a candidate, it might be worth exploring minor adjustments or closely related words.\nguess: brush<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> u<red> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that all letters in \"brush\" are red, indicating none of them are in the correct word, and considering the previous agreement with \"brash\", it seems that \"brash\" itself might be worth re-examining as a potential solution since the feedback on \"brush\" does not provide any new letters to work with. The clue \"shrewd\" and the previous feedback suggest that \"brash\" could indeed be a strong fit, and without any new information to contradict this, it's reasonable to revisit \"brash\" as a possible answer.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: given the lack of new information from the feedback on \"brush\" and the previous consideration of \"brash\" as a plausible fit, it's reasonable to stick with \"brash\" as it aligns with the clue \"shrewd\" and no new evidence contradicts its potential as a solution.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the continued agreement with \"brash\" and the lack of any contradictory evidence, it seems that \"brash\" is a very strong candidate for the solution. The clue \"shrewd\" aligns well with the meaning of \"brash\", which can imply a certain level of cleverness or astuteness, and without any feedback indicating that the letters in \"brash\" are incorrect, it's reasonable to conclude that \"brash\" could indeed be the correct answer.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|>",

Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" is \"wager\", but another option could be \"awake\" or \"aware\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive.\nguess: awake<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"awake\" incorporates the letter \"a\" which is indicated as a correct letter in the wrong position, and it also aligns with the concept of being perceptive or clever, which is related to the clue \"shrewd\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"awake\" and the clue \"shrewd\", the next guess should continue to utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters that fit the concept of being clever or perceptive. A word that aligns with this concept and has 5 letters is \"aware\", which also includes the letter \"a\" and conveys a sense of being sharp or astute.\nguess: aware<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> w<red> a<red> r<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that only the first \"a\" is yellow, indicating it's in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters being red, the next guess should utilize the letter \"a\" in a different position and explore other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need for a new set of letters, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" in a potentially correct position is \"craft\", but another option could be \"brash\" or \"slash\" since they also convey a sense of cleverness or being perceptive, however \"brash\" seems to be a better fit given the letter \"a\" placement.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"brash\" utilizes the letter \"a\" in a different position, as suggested by the feedback, and it also conveys a sense of being perceptive or clever, aligning with the clue \"shrewd\", and considering the previous feedback, \"brash\" seems like a plausible fit.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"brash\" and considering it as a plausible fit, the next step is to assess if \"brash\" could indeed be the target word or if it needs further adjustment. Since \"brash\" aligns well with the clue \"shrewd\" and utilizes the letter \"a\" in a potentially correct position based on the feedback, it's reasonable to consider \"brash\" as a strong candidate. However, without explicit confirmation, another word that also fits the description and is similar to \"brash\" in conveying cleverness is \"brush\", but given the strength of \"brash\" as a candidate, it might be worth exploring minor adjustments or closely related words.\nguess: brush<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> u<red> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that all letters in \"brush\" are red, indicating none of them are in the correct word, and considering the previous agreement with \"brash\", it seems that \"brash\" itself might be worth re-examining as a potential solution since the feedback on \"brush\" does not provide any new letters to work with. The clue \"shrewd\" and the previous feedback suggest that \"brash\" could indeed be a strong fit, and without any new information to contradict this, it's reasonable to revisit \"brash\" as a possible answer.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: given the lack of new information from the feedback on \"brush\" and the previous consideration of \"brash\" as a plausible fit, it's reasonable to stick with \"brash\" as it aligns with the clue \"shrewd\" and no new evidence contradicts its potential as a solution.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the continued agreement with \"brash\" and the lack of any contradictory evidence, it seems that \"brash\" is a very strong candidate for the solution. The clue \"shrewd\" aligns well with the meaning of \"brash\", which can imply a certain level of cleverness or astuteness, and without any feedback indicating that the letters in \"brash\" are incorrect, it's reasonable to conclude that \"brash\" could indeed be the correct answer.\nguess: brash<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> a<yellow> s<red> h<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the new feedback that \"a\" is yellow, indicating it is in the word but not in the correct position, and all other letters in \"brash\" being red, the next guess should focus on utilizing the letter \"a\" in a different position while exploring other letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need to incorporate \"a\" correctly, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" is \"savvy\", which conveys a sense of being clever or perceptive, aligning with the clue.\nguess: savvy<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"savvy\" incorporates the letter \"a\" in a different position, as suggested by the feedback, and it also aligns with the concept of being clever or perceptive, which is related to the clue \"shrewd\", making \"savvy\" a plausible fit given the new information.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"savvy\" and its alignment with the clue \"shrewd\", the next step is to consider if \"savvy\" could indeed be the target word. Since \"savvy\" fits the description, includes the letter \"a\" in a potentially correct position based on the feedback, and conveys a sense of cleverness or perceptiveness, it's reasonable to consider \"savvy\" as a strong candidate. Without any explicit contradictory evidence, and given the positive alignment with the clue and the feedback, \"savvy\" appears to be a likely solution.\nguess: savvy<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> a<green> v<red> v<red> y<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the feedback that \"a\" and \"y\" are green, indicating they are in the correct positions, and \"s\", \"v\", \"v\" being red, the next guess should focus on keeping \"a\" and \"y\" in their positions while replacing the incorrect letters. Considering the clue \"shrewd\" and the need to incorporate \"a\" and \"y\" correctly, a word that fits the description and includes \"a\" and \"y\" in the same positions is \"shady\", which conveys a sense of cleverness or cunning, aligning with the clue.\nguess: shady<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: shrewd\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"shady\" keeps the letters \"a\" and \"y\" in the same positions as indicated by the green feedback, and it also aligns with the concept of being clever or cunning, which is related to the clue \"shrewd\", making \"shady\" a strong fit given the correct placement of \"a\" and \"y\".\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the agreement with \"shady\" and its strong alignment with the clue \"shrewd\", as well as the correct placement of \"a\" and \"y\" as indicated by the feedback, it seems that \"shady\" is a very likely solution. The word \"shady\" not only fits the given letters but also conveys a sense of cleverness or cunning, which matches the meaning of \"shrewd\". Without any further contradictory evidence, it's reasonable to conclude that \"shady\" could indeed be the correct answer.\nguess: shady<|eot_id|>",
