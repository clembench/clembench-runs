You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: shrewd",

    "Given the agreement with the guess \"smart\" and its relation to being clever, the next step is to consider other words that convey a similar meaning.

    "Given the agreement with \"awake\" and the clue \"shrewd\", the next guess should continue to utilize the letter \"a\" and explore other letters that fit the concept of being clever or perceptive. A word that aligns with this concept and has 5 letters is \"aware\", which also includes the letter \"a\" and conveys a sense of being sharp or astute.",
    "Given the agreement with \"brash\" and considering it as a plausible fit, the next step is to assess if \"brash\" could indeed be the target word or if it needs further adjustment. Since \"brash\" aligns well with the clue \"shrewd\" and utilizes the letter \"a\" in a potentially correct position based on the feedback, it's reasonable to consider \"brash\" as a strong candidate. However, without explicit confirmation, another word that also fits the description and is similar to \"brash\" in conveying cleverness is \"brush\", but given the strength of \"brash\" as a candidate, it might be worth exploring minor adjustments or closely related words.",
    "Given the continued agreement with \"brash\" and the lack of any contradictory evidence, it seems that \"brash\" is a very strong candidate for the solution. The clue \"shrewd\" aligns well with the meaning of \"brash\", which can imply a certain level of cleverness or astuteness, and without any feedback indicating that the letters in \"brash\" are incorrect, it's reasonable to conclude that \"brash\" could indeed be the correct answer.",
