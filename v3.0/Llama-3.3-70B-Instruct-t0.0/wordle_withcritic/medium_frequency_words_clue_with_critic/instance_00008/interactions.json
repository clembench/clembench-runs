You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: make current",

  "Guesser Explanations": [
    "Considering the clue \"make current\" and the previous agreement with \"ample\", a new guess could be a word that is directly related to the concept of electricity or updating, and a valid 5-letter word that fits this description is \"update\" without the last two letters, which results in a word that is closely related to the concept of making something current, and a possible guess is a word that is associated with the flow of electricity, such as a word that sounds similar to \"ample\" but is more directly related to the concept of current.",
    "Given the agreement with the guess \"newer\" and its relation to making something current, a new guess could be a word that is even more directly associated with the concept of updating or modernizing, and considering the clue \"make current\", a possible guess is a word that is synonymous with \"newer\" or closely related to the idea of being up-to-date, and a 5-letter word that fits this description is \"update\" without the last two letters, but since \"newer\" is already a good fit, a more refined guess would be to consider words that are closely related to \"newer\" and also fit the given feedback, and one possible word is \"newer\" itself or a word that is very similar.",
    "Given the strong agreement with the guess \"renew\" and its perfect fit with the clue \"make current\", as well as the correct placement of the double \"e\"s and the rearrangement of the letters \"n\", \"w\", and \"r\", it seems that \"renew\" is a very likely candidate for the target word, and considering that it meets all the criteria and feedback provided, a reasonable next step would be to confirm this guess or make a minor adjustment if necessary, but given the strength of the agreement and the fit with the clue, the most logical guess is to stick with \"renew\"."
