        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: &quot;snowy white&quot;<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br/>1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own<br/>2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: make current</p>

        <p>explanation: The phrase &quot;make current&quot; could be related to updating or modernizing something, and one word that comes to mind is &quot;update&quot;, but since it has 6 letters, a 5-letter alternative could be &quot;amend&quot; or a word related to electricity, such as &quot;amply&quot; or simply &quot;amper&quot; is not a word, however &quot;amper&quot; is close to &quot;amply&quot; and &quot;amend&quot; is not directly related to electricity, a better guess would be a word that is related to electricity, such as &quot;amply&quot; without the last letter, which results in &quot;ample&quot;.<br/>guess: ample</p>
    </div>

    <div speaker="GM (Game Master) to Player 2 (WordCritic)" class="msg gm-b" style="">
        <p>I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.<br/><br/>For example, if the clue is &quot;snow white&quot; and the guess is &quot;apple&quot;, you will get the information like this:<br/>clue: snow white<br/>explanation: the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.<br/><br/>If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.<br/><br/>Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.<br/><br/>Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:<br/>explanation: your reason for doing so<br/>agreement: yes or no<br/><br/>Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin!<br/><br/>clue: make current<br/>explanation: The phrase &quot;make current&quot; could be related to updating or modernizing something, and one word that comes to mind is &quot;update&quot;, but since it has 6 letters, a 5-letter alternative could be &quot;amend&quot; or a word related to electricity, such as &quot;amply&quot; or simply &quot;amper&quot; is not a word, however &quot;amper&quot; is close to &quot;amply&quot; and &quot;amend&quot; is not directly related to electricity, a better guess would be a word that is related to electricity, such as &quot;amply&quot; without the last letter, which results in &quot;ample&quot;.<br/>guess: ample</p>

        <p>explanation: the given guess &quot;ample&quot; seems to be related to the clue &quot;make current&quot; as it can be associated with electricity, and the explanation provided attempts to justify the guess by connecting it to the concept of updating or modernizing something, and also provides a reasonable connection to electricity.<br/>agreement: yes</p>

        <p>explanation: Given the agreement with the guess &quot;ample&quot; and its relation to electricity, a more direct connection to &quot;make current&quot; could be a word that is closely associated with the concept of electrical current, such as &quot;amper&quot; being part of &quot;ampere&quot;, a unit of electric current, but since &quot;amper&quot; is not a valid word, a better guess would be a word that is directly related to making something current in the context of electricity, which leads to considering words like &quot;amply&quot; again or alternatives that fit the 5-letter criteria, and one possible word that is closely related to the concept of current is &quot;amper&quot; without the &quot;r&quot; at the end and adding a letter that makes it a valid word, however a more suitable guess would be to consider the word &quot;update&quot; without the last two letters and replacing them with letters that make it related to electricity.<br/>guess: ampup</p>
