        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: &quot;snowy white&quot;<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br/>1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own<br/>2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: passenger ship</p>

        <p>explanation: A common term for a passenger ship is a liner, but since the word needs to be 5 letters, I&#x27;ll consider other options. A vessel that carries passengers is often referred to as a boat, but a more specific type of passenger ship is a ferry or a liner. However, a simple 5-letter word that comes to mind related to passenger ships is &quot;liner&quot; doesn&#x27;t fit, so I&#x27;ll guess a word that is related to ships and has 5 letters: &quot;steer&quot; is not a ship, but to &quot;sail&quot; or &quot;cabin&quot; could be related, and &quot;cabin&quot; is not the ship itself but part of it.<br/>guess: cabin</p>

        <p>I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.<br/><br/>For example, if the clue is &quot;snow white&quot; and the guess is &quot;apple&quot;, you will get the information like this:<br/>clue: snow white<br/>explanation: the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.<br/><br/>If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.<br/><br/>Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.<br/><br/>Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:<br/>explanation: your reason for doing so<br/>agreement: yes or no<br/><br/>Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin!<br/><br/>clue: passenger ship<br/>explanation: A common term for a passenger ship is a liner, but since the word needs to be 5 letters, I&#x27;ll consider other options.

        <p>explanation: Given the agreement that &quot;cabin&quot; is a plausible option because it&#x27;s a part of a passenger ship, the next step is to consider if there are other words that are more directly related to passenger ships. Since &quot;cabin&quot; is already a strong candidate, the next guess could be a word that is also closely associated with passenger ships. A common term for a large passenger ship is a &quot;liner&quot;, but another word that fits the 5-letter criteria and is directly related to passenger ships could be &quot;ships&quot; itself or a synonym. However, considering the direct relation and common terminology, &quot;liner&quot; seems like a strong candidate, but it doesn&#x27;t fit the length. Another option could be &quot;vessel&quot;, but it&#x27;s not exactly 5 letters. Considering the parts of a ship or the experience of being on one, &quot;cabin&quot; remains a strong guess, but exploring other ship-related terms could yield a better fit. <br/>guess: ferry</p>

        <p>explanation: With the feedback from the guess &quot;ferry&quot;, it&#x27;s clear that the letters &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; are not in the correct positions or are not part of the target word, as indicated by the red color. The letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are marked yellow, meaning they are part of the word but not in the correct positions. Given this information and the clue that the word is related to a &quot;passenger ship&quot;, and considering the previous agreement that &quot;cabin&quot; is a plausible option, the next guess should incorporate the yellow letters (&quot;e&quot; and &quot;r&quot;) in different positions and avoid the red letters (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, and &quot;y&quot;). A possible word that fits this criteria and is related to passenger ships could be a synonym or a word that describes a part of the ship where passengers are found, such as &quot;berth&quot;.<br/>guess: berth</p>

        <p>explanation: Given the agreement that &quot;berth&quot; is a plausible option because it incorporates the yellow letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;r&quot; correctly, avoids the red letters, and is directly related to passenger ships, the next step is to refine the guess based on the clue and the feedback. Since &quot;berth&quot; refers to a specific part of a ship and fits the criteria well, considering other words that are closely related to the overall concept of a passenger ship is necessary. The clue &quot;passenger ship&quot; suggests looking for a word that is either a synonym for such a vessel or a word that describes its function or a significant part of it. Given that &quot;berth&quot; is a strong candidate and considering the need to guess a word that is a direct representation of a passenger ship, exploring synonyms or related terms that fit the 5-letter length is essential. A possible word that fits this description and is related to ships could be &quot;cabin&quot;, which was previously guessed and agreed upon as a plausible option, or another term that directly refers to a type of passenger ship.<br/>guess: liner</p>
