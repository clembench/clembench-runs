You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.

  "Guesser Explanations": [
    "Considering the previous guess \"anger\" was agreed upon due to its relation to being annoyed, which aligns with one meaning of \"tick off\", the next guess should be a valid 5-letter word. Reflecting on the clue \"tick off\" and its dual meaning of both annoying someone and checking off a list, a new approach is to think of words that might fit either definition. A word that could relate to the action of marking or checking something, and is a valid English word, is \"stamp\".",
    "Given the agreement with the guess \"steam\" and its alignment with the provided feedback and the clue \"tick off\", the next step is to refine the guess further. The word \"steam\" fits the given letters and their positions, but it's essential to ensure it's the best fit for the clue. Considering the dual meaning of \"tick off\" as both to annoy and to mark off, and the fact that \"steam\" can imply a state of being heated or annoyed, it seems like a plausible solution. However, exploring other options that might fit the \"tick off\" clue more closely, especially in the context of marking or checking something, is necessary. A word that could fit this context and utilizes the correct letters is \"stick\", but since \"steam\" was agreed upon, a closer examination of words related to \"steam\" or its implications might yield a better result. A word that aligns with the concept of annoyance or irritation, similar to \"steam\" implying heated emotion, and fits the given letter pattern could be \"stain\" or another word that matches the pattern and clue more accurately.",
    "Given the repeated agreement with the guess \"steam\" and its strong alignment with the provided feedback and the clue \"tick off\", it seems that \"steam\" is a very likely solution. The word \"steam\" not only fits the given letter pattern and positions but also conceptually aligns with the idea of something being heated or annoyed, which can be related to the phrase \"tick off\". With no new information suggesting an alternative and the previous guesses and feedback supporting \"steam\", it's reasonable to consider \"steam\" as a potential final answer."
