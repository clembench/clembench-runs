        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: &quot;snowy white&quot;<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br/>1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own<br/>2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: tick off</p>

        <p>explanation: The phrase &quot;tick off&quot; can mean to annoy or irritate someone, and it can also refer to the act of checking or marking something on a list. A word that comes to mind related to this phrase is &quot;irate&quot;, but since it doesn&#x27;t fit the 5-letter criteria, I&#x27;ll consider a different word. A 5-letter word that is related to the concept of being annoyed is &quot;anger&quot;.<br/>guess: anger</p>

        <p>I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.<br/><br/>For example, if the clue is &quot;snow white&quot; and the guess is &quot;apple&quot;, you will get the information like this:<br/>clue: snow white<br/>explanation: the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.<br/><br/>If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.<br/><br/>Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.<br/><br/>Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:<br/>explanation: your reason for doing so<br/>agreement: yes or no<br/><br/>Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin!<br/><br/>clue: tick off<br/>explanation: The phrase &quot;tick off&quot; can mean to annoy or irritate someone, and it can also refer to the act of checking or marking something on a list.

        <p>explanation: Given the agreement with the guess &quot;anger&quot; and its relation to the phrase &quot;tick off&quot;, the next step is to consider words that are similar or related to &quot;anger&quot; but also fit the description of &quot;tick off&quot; in other ways. Another meaning of &quot;tick off&quot; is to mark or check something on a list, which leads to the word &quot;check&quot; or other related terms. However, since &quot;anger&quot; was agreed upon, exploring synonyms or related words to &quot;anger&quot; that fit the 5-letter criteria could be beneficial. A word that is related to annoyance but also could fit the marking or checking context is &quot;irrit&quot;.<br/>guess: irrit</p>

        <p>explanation: Considering the previous guess &quot;anger&quot; was agreed upon due to its relation to being annoyed, which aligns with one meaning of &quot;tick off&quot;, the next guess should be a valid 5-letter word. Reflecting on the clue &quot;tick off&quot; and its dual meaning of both annoying someone and checking off a list, a new approach is to think of words that might fit either definition. A word that could relate to the action of marking or checking something, and is a valid English word, is &quot;stamp&quot;.<br/>guess: stamp</p>

        <p>explanation: Given the agreement with the guess &quot;steam&quot; and its alignment with the provided feedback and the clue &quot;tick off&quot;, the next step is to refine the guess further. The word &quot;steam&quot; fits the given letters and their positions, but it&#x27;s essential to ensure it&#x27;s the best fit for the clue. Considering the dual meaning of &quot;tick off&quot; as both to annoy and to mark off, and the fact that &quot;steam&quot; can imply a state of being heated or annoyed, it seems like a plausible solution. However, exploring other options that might fit the &quot;tick off&quot; clue more closely, especially in the context of marking or checking something, is necessary. A word that could fit this context and utilizes the correct letters is &quot;stick&quot;, but since &quot;steam&quot; was agreed upon, a closer examination of words related to &quot;steam&quot; or its implications might yield a better result. A word that aligns with the concept of annoyance or irritation, similar to &quot;steam&quot; implying heated emotion, and fits the given letter pattern could be &quot;stain&quot; or another word that matches the pattern and clue more accurately.<br/>guess: stain</p>

Given that &quot;steam&quot; was a previously agreed-upon guess that fits the pattern and clue more closely than &quot;stain&quot;, and considering the feedback, it seems prudent to revisit and refine guesses similar to &quot;steam&quot;. The letters &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;m&quot; were previously identified as part of the correct solution, with &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in the correct positions.
