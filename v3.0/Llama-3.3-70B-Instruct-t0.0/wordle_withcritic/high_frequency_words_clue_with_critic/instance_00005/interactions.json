You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: divine ___",

Given the disagreement with \"digit\" and considering the need for a word that both fits the feedback and relates to the divine theme, we should look for a 5-letter word that includes \"i\" and \"g\" in different positions and is associated with divinity. A possible approach is to revisit previous guesses that were related to the divine theme and see if any variations could fit the given feedback. Since \"being\" was a strong candidate and \"i\" and \"g\" are in the word, a word that could fit is something closely related to \"being\" but with \"i\" and \"g\" in different positions, or another word that directly relates to the divine and includes these letters.\nguess: divine",

  "Guesser Explanations": [
    "Given the agreement with the guess \"being\" and its association with the concept of divinity, the next step is to consider other words that are closely related to \"divine\". One such word is \"bless\", which is often used in a divine context, but it's shorter than 5 letters. A 5-letter word that fits well with the divine theme could be \"bless\" extended to \"blest\" or another word that is directly related to divinity, such as \"being\" was. Considering the divine context, another word that comes to mind is \"godly\", which directly relates to the divine.",
    "With the agreement on \"angel\" and considering the clue \"divine ___\", it's clear that words related to spiritual or heavenly beings are on the right track. The feedback on \"godly\" showed \"g\" in a wrong position, and \"angel\" fits the divine theme perfectly. However, to explore other possibilities that might fit the \"divine ___\" clue and the given feedback, another word that comes to mind is \"angel\" itself or something closely related. Given the divine context, a word that is synonymous or closely related to \"angel\" could be \"spirit\", but it doesn't directly include \"g\". Considering the direct relation to divinity and the inclusion of \"g\", \"angel\" seems like a strong candidate, but let's consider a variation that could also fit the given feedback and clue, such as \"angels\" without the's' or a word that sounds similar.",
    "Given the agreement on \"being\" and considering the clue \"divine ___\" along with the feedback that \"g\" is in the correct position in the word \"angel\", it seems that \"being\" could indeed be a strong candidate for the word. The word \"being\" relates well to the concept of divinity, and with the \"g\" in the correct position as indicated by the feedback on \"angel\", it's plausible that \"being\" is the word we're looking for. Since \"being\" has been a consistent guess that fits the divine theme and now aligns with the feedback, the next step is to consider if there are any other words that could also fit this pattern, but given the information, \"being\" seems like a very likely candidate."
