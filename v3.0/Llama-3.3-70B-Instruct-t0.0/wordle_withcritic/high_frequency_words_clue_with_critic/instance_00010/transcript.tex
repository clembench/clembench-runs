	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: stand in (for)

	 I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, if the clue is "snow white" and the guess is "apple", you will get the information like this:\\ \tt clue: snow white\\ \tt explanation: the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.\\ \tt \\ \tt If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\\ \tt explanation: your reason for doing so\\ \tt agreement: yes or no\\ \tt \\ \tt Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin!\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: stand in (for)\\ \tt explanation: The phrase "stand in (for)" makes me think of a substitute or replacement, which leads me to consider words related to acting or representation.

	 explanation: Given the agreement with "proxy", I'll explore other words that convey a similar meaning of substitution or representation. Another word that fits this context is "deput", but it's not a common term. A more suitable option could be "agent", as an agent acts on behalf of someone or something, aligning with the idea of standing in for. However, considering the exact length and common usage, "proxy" seems a strong candidate, but to further explore, a synonym for proxy is "agent", yet a more direct and commonly used term in this context is actually "proxy" itself or words closely related to it, such as "represent" is too long, so looking at shorter forms, "proxy" remains a strong guess, but let's consider "reps" as in representatives, which also stand in for others, but given the full word is needed, "proxy" fits well.\\ \tt guess: proxy

	 explanation: With the feedback that "p", "x", and "y" are incorrect (red) and "r" and "o" are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), I need to rethink the word. Since "proxy" had the right concept but wrong letters, I'll look for a word that fits the clue "stand in (for)" and incorporates "r" and "o" in different positions. A word that comes to mind related to standing in or representing is "roast", but it doesn't quite fit the context of substitution. Considering other options, "orals" doesn't fit, but "rover" does imply a form of substitution or replacement in certain contexts, though it's a bit of a stretch. A more fitting word could be one that directly relates to acting on behalf of someone, such as "represent", but it's too long. Given the constraint of 5 letters and the need to include "r" and "o", let's consider words that directly imply standing in for something, which leads to thinking about roles or positions, hence "roles" could be a possibility.\\ \tt guess: roles

	 explanation: Given the agreement with "roles" and considering the clue "stand in (for)", I'll further explore words that relate to acting, representing, or substituting. The word "roles" itself is a strong candidate because it directly relates to parts or characters that someone can stand in for, especially in theatrical contexts. However, to ensure I'm not missing a more fitting word, I'll consider synonyms or related terms. Another word that comes to mind is "relay", which implies passing on or standing in for something, but it doesn't perfectly fit the theatrical or representational context as strongly as "roles" does. Since "roles" aligns well with the clue and incorporates the correct letters in potentially correct positions, it seems like a solid choice to stick with or slightly modify. Given no strong reason to deviate, "roles" remains a logical guess.\\ \tt guess: roles

	 explanation: With the new feedback, "o" and "e" are in the correct positions (green), while "r" is correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and "l" and "s" are incorrect (red). Given this, I need to adjust the word to fit the correct positions of "o" and "e" and find a new position for "r". The clue "stand in (for)" still points towards representation or substitution. Considering the correct placement of "o" and "e" and the need to reposition "r", a word that fits this pattern and relates to the clue could be "repoe" is not a word, so looking at other combinations that keep "o" and "e" in their correct positions and utilize "r" in a different spot, I think about words that mean to stand in for something, which leads me to consider "rope" doesn't fit as "r" is not in the right spot, but a word that does fit the given letters and their positions, and also aligns with the concept of standing in, could be a word that implies a substitute or replacement, hence thinking of a term that directly relates to acting on behalf of, I come across "proxy" was already guessed, so looking for something similar, "repine" doesn't fit, but "repose" doesn't align with the clue well, yet a word that does is actually "replace" is too
