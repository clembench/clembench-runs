Considering the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\", a possible song is \"Never\" which doesn't fit, but another hit is \"What About Love\" doesn't fit the given letters, however \"alone\" doesn't have an \"e\" in the correct position but does have an \"e\" and considering other songs, \"magic\" has an \"e\" in the second position in the word \"magic\" man, but doesn't fit the \"r\" in the correct position, a song with \"e\" and \"r\" is needed.\nguess: never<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\nguess_agreement: no\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"never\" does not match the given feedback as \"e\" is in the correct position in the guess, but the letters \"n\", \"v\" are not indicated in the feedback, and the position of \"r\" is also not correct according to the feedback.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\" and the feedback where \"e\" is correct and in the right position, \"r\" is correct but in the wrong position, and considering the disagreement with \"never\", a new guess is needed. Looking at Heart's 1985 discography, a possible fit is a word that contains \"e\" and \"r\" in different positions. One of Heart's hits in 1985 was \"What About Love\" and another was \"These Dreams\", but neither directly fits the given letters. However, considering the \"e\" in the correct position and \"r\" in a different position, a possible guess could be a word related to music or love, such as \"lover\" or another word that fits the given letters.\nguess: lover<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<red> o<red> v<green> e<green> r<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With the new feedback, \"l\" and \"o\" are incorrect, but \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\" are correct and in the right positions.

Given that \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\" are at the end, a word that fits is \"lover\" is close but the first two letters are incorrect, another possibility is a word that ends with \"ver\" and has \"e\" in the correct position, such as \"sever\" or \"believer\" doesn't fit, but a simpler word could be \"mover\" or another word that fits the given letters and clue.\nguess: mover<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\nguess_agreement: no\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"mover\" matches the given feedback as it contains the correct letters \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\" in the right positions, and considering the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\", a possible related word could be \"mover\" or a song title, but no direct connection to a 1985 hit by Heart is established, however, the word fits the given letters.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Given the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\" and the feedback where \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\" are correct and in the right positions, and considering the disagreement with \"mover\" due to lack of direct connection to a 1985 hit by Heart, another possible guess is needed.

You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.
