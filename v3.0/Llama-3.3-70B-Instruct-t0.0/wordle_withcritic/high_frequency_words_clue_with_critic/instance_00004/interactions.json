You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart",

    "Since the guess \"heart\" is agreed upon and it matches the clue directly, the next step is to consider if there are other songs by Heart in 1985 that could fit, but given the direct mention, it seems \"heart\" could indeed be the target word or very close to it.",
    "Given the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\" and the feedback where \"e\" is correct and in the right position, \"r\" is correct but in the wrong position, and considering the disagreement with \"never\", a new guess is needed. Looking at Heart's 1985 discography, a possible fit is a word that contains \"e\" and \"r\" in different positions. One of Heart's hits in 1985 was \"What About Love\" and another was \"These Dreams\", but neither directly fits the given letters. However, considering the \"e\" in the correct position and \"r\" in a different position, a possible guess could be a word related to music or love, such as \"lover\" or another word that fits the given letters.",
    "Given the clue \"1985 hit by Heart\" and the feedback where \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\" are correct and in the right positions, and considering the disagreement with \"mover\" due to lack of direct connection to a 1985 hit by Heart, another possible guess is needed. Looking at Heart's 1985 discography, one of their hits was \"What About Love\" and another was \"These Dreams\", but neither directly fits the given letters. However, considering the correct letters \"v\", \"e\", and \"r\", a possible guess could be a word related to music or love, such as a song that has these letters, and one possible song is \"What About Love\" doesn't fit, but another song by Heart in 1985 is not directly found, however \"mover\" is a possible word, another word that fits the given letters is \"shaver\" doesn't fit, but a simpler word could be \"lover\" was already guessed, so another word that ends with \"ver\" and has \"e\" in the correct position could be the answer."
