The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\nPlease respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nexplanation: your reason for doing so\nagreement: yes or no\n\nPlease note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nclue: comatose\nexplanation: The word \"comatose\" is related to a state of deep unconsciousness, and a word that comes to mind related to sleep or unconsciousness is \"sleep\", but since it has only 5 letters, it seems like a good starting point.\nguess: sleep<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: the guess \"sleep\" seems to be related to the clue \"comatose\" as both are associated with a state of unconsciousness, and it meets the 5-letter criteria.\nagreement: yes<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue: comatose\nexplanation: With the feedback that all letters in \"swoon\" except \"n\" are incorrect, and considering the previous agreement with \"sleep\" and the clue \"comatose\", the next guess should include \"n\" and be related to unconsciousness, a possible word is \"night\" which is associated with sleep and meets the 5-letter criteria.\nguess: night\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nagreement: yes or no<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: the guess \"night\" seems plausible as it includes the letter \"n\" and is related to sleep or unconsciousness, aligning with the clue \"comatose\" and the previous guess \"sleep\", and it meets the 5-letter criteria.\nagreement: yes<|eot_id|>",

You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red).
