Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Is the background or the cells of your grid a uniform color or pattern, or is there any variation?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: The background or the cells of my grid are a uniform color or pattern, with no variation.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>",
