Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ ▢ X X ▢\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X ▢<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with a border of empty cells, and an internal pattern of Xs forming a cross with a gap in the middle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: 5x5 grid with a border of empty cells, and an internal pattern of Xs forming a cross with a gap in the middle.\nQUESTION: Are there any additional Xs or empty cells within the internal pattern that differ from the described cross with a gap in the middle? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, there are no additional Xs or empty cells within the internal pattern that differ from the described cross with a gap in the middle.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Is the gap in the middle of the cross exactly one cell wide and one cell tall, forming a perfect intersection where the horizontal and vertical lines of Xs meet?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: Yes, the gap in the middle of the cross is exactly one cell wide and one cell tall, forming a perfect intersection where the horizontal and vertical lines of Xs meet.\nQUESTION: Does the internal pattern of Xs in your grid have any variations in the placement of the Xs along the cross, such as being shifted up, down, left, or right? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, the internal pattern of Xs in my grid does not have any variations in the placement of the Xs along the cross; they are aligned perfectly as described.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Are all the cells outside the internal cross pattern, but inside the border, empty in your grid?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: Yes, all the cells outside the internal cross pattern, but inside the border, are empty in my grid.\nQUESTION: Is the border of your grid consistently one cell wide all around, with no variations or breaks? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, the border of my grid is consistently one cell wide all around, with no variations or breaks.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: Does your grid contain any other symbols or characters besides Xs and empty cells?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: No, my grid contains no other symbols or characters besides Xs and empty cells.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nDECISION: same grid<|im_end|>",
