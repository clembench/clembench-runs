The pattern is as follows: First row - X X ▢ X ▢, Second row - X X ▢ X X, Third row - X X X X X, Fourth row - X X ▢ X X, Fifth row - X X ▢ ▢ X.\nQUESTION: Does your grid have any empty squares (▢) outside the central column? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: Yes, there are empty squares (▢) outside the central column in the first and fifth rows.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: In your grid, are there any rows where the pattern of Xs and empty squares (▢) is not symmetrical around the central column?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: No, every row in my grid is symmetrical around the central column.\nQUESTION: In your grid, are there any rows that contain more than one empty square (▢) outside the central column? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nANSWER: No, there are no rows that contain more than one empty square (▢) outside the central column.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nQUESTION: In your grid, which rows contain an empty square (▢) in the first or last column?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nANSWER: The first and fifth rows contain an empty square (▢) in the first or last column.\nQUESTION: In your grid, does the second or fourth row contain an empty square (▢) in the second or fourth column?
