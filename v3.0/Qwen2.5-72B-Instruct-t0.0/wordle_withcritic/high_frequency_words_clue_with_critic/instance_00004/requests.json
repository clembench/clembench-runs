Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The clue mentions a hit from 1985, and \"heart\" could be a reference to the band or the emotion. A popular song from that year was \"Take My Breath Away\" by Berlin, but since we need a five-letter word, I'll consider \"heart\" itself as a potential guess.\nguess: heart<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"heart\" fits the clue well, as it can refer to both the band Heart and the emotion, and it is a five-letter word. however, without guess feedback, i cannot confirm if it is the correct answer.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Since \"heart\" fits the clue and is a valid five-letter word, and there was no feedback to suggest otherwise, I will stick with \"heart\" for now.\nguess: heart<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: h<red> e<green> a<red> r<yellow> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: From the feedback, we know that 'e' is in the correct position, and 'r' is in the word but in the wrong position. We need to find a word that fits these criteria and relates to the clue about a 1985 hit by heart.\nguess: erode<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\nguess_agreement: no\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"erode\" fits the feedback provided, with 'e' in the correct position and 'r' present but in the wrong position. however, it does not seem to directly relate to the 1985 hit by heart clue.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given the feedback and the need to relate to the 1985 hit by Heart, I will focus on words that fit the pattern and are more likely to be related to music or the band Heart. The word \"ear\" is already partially formed, so I will try to build on that.\nguess: earld<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Since \"earld\" is not a valid word, I will reconsider the feedback and the clue. The word must contain 'e' in the second position and 'r' in a different position. A more fitting word that relates to music and the band Heart could be \"lear.\"\nguess: learl<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: \"Learl\" is also not a valid word. Given the feedback and the clue, I need to find a valid word that fits the pattern and relates to the 1985 hit by Heart. The word \"lear\" is close, but I need to replace the last letter with something that makes sense. The word \"learn\" fits the pattern and is a valid word.\nguess: learn<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: l<red> e<green> a<red> r<yellow> n<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that 'e' is in the correct position, 'r' and 'n' are in the word but in the wrong positions. I need to rearrange these letters to form a valid word that fits the clue. The word \"near\" seems to fit the pattern and the context of a 1985 hit by Heart.\nguess: nears<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nclue: 1985 hit by heart\nguess_agreement: yes\nagreement_explanation: the guess \"nears\" fits the feedback with 'e' in the correct position, and 'r' and 'n' present but in the wrong positions. it also fits the context of a 1985 hit by heart, as \"these dreams\" by heart includes the word \"near\" in its lyrics, making \"nears\" a plausible guess.\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nexplanation: Given the feedback and the clue, \"nears\" fits well. However, since \"nears\" is not a common word and the feedback suggests a slight adjustment, I will try \"near\" as it is a valid word and fits the pattern.\nguess: near<|im_end|>",
