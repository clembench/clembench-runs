You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.",

    "The feedback shows that 'r' and 'e' are in the correct positions, and 'n' is also in the word but needs to be moved. I will keep 'r' and 'e' fixed and try to place 'n' in a different position.",
    "Since 'renet' is not a valid word, I will try another combination, keeping 'r' and 'e' in their correct positions and placing 'n' in a different spot. I will also consider a different vowel to replace 't'.",
    "Since 'reinn' is not a valid word, I will try another combination, keeping 'r', 'e', and both 'n's in their correct positions and moving 'i' to the second-to-last position.",
    "Since 'reinn' is not a valid word, I will try a different approach. I will keep 'r', 'e', and both 'n's in their correct positions and place 'i' in the third position, forming a valid English word."
