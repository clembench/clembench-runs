A common word associated with this phrase is \"list.\" The word \"list\" has 4 letters, but since the target word has 5 letters, I'll consider other related words. One possible word is \"cross,\" but it's not a perfect fit. Another option is \"strike,\" which has 6 letters, but I can try to shorten it to 5 letters by removing the last letter, resulting in the word \"strip.\" However, \"strip\" is not directly related to the phrase \"tick off.\" A more suitable option is the word \"strike\" without the last letter, but with a different letter in the middle, resulting in the word \"strik\" which is not a word. However, I can try to shorten \"strike\" to 5 letters by removing the last letter and replacing the middle letter with a different letter, resulting in the word \"stirk\" which is not a word.
