This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since \"s\" is the only yellow letter, it means the word contains \"s\" but not in the correct position. I will try to find a word that has \"s\" in a different position.\nguess: bless<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<green> e<red> s<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"l\" and \"s\" being yellow, it means both letters are in the word but not in the correct position. I will try to find a word that has both \"l\" and \"s\" in different positions.\nguess: slabs<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<green> a<red> b<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since \"s\" and \"l\" are now green, it means they are in the correct positions. I will try to find a word that keeps the correct positions of \"s\" and \"l\" and uses the remaining letters to form a valid word.\nguess: slink<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<green> i<green> n<red> k<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: With \"s\", \"l\", and \"i\" being green, it means they are in the correct positions.
