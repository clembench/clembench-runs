This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since 'o' is green, it's likely in the correct position. 'E' is yellow, so it's in the word but not in the correct position. I'll try to use these letters in my next guess.\nguess: globe<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<red> o<yellow> b<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: 'O' is still yellow, suggesting it's in the word but not in the correct position. 'E' is also yellow, so it's still in the word but not in the correct position. I'll try to use these letters in my next guess and avoid the letters that are consistently red.\nguess: moles<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<green> l<red> e<green> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: 'O' is now green, so it's in the correct position. 'E' is also green, so it's in the correct position. With this new information, I'll try to use the correct letters in my next guess and avoid the letters that are consistently red.\nguess: boast<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> o<green> a<red> s<red> t<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: 'O' is still green, so it's in the correct position.
