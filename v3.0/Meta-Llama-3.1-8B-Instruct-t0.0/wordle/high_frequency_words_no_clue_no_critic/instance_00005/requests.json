This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is often used in everyday conversations.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Since \"h\" is yellow, it means the word contains \"h\" but not in the correct position. I will keep \"h\" in my next guess. The other letters \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are all red, indicating they are not in the word, so I will exclude them.\nguess: thumb<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> h<yellow> u<red> m<red> b<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: Both \"t\" and \"h\" are yellow, which means they are in the word but not in the correct positions. I will keep both \"t\" and \"h\" in my next guess. The letters \"u\", \"m\", and \"b\" are all red, indicating they are not in the word, so I will exclude them.\nguess: thall<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYour guess is not a valid word for this game.
