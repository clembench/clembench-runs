Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of empty squares and X's, where the X's are located in the top two rows and bottom two rows, and there are no X's in the third row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of filled and empty squares, containing a pair of X's in the third row, and no other filled squares.\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the first or second column of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are X's in the second column of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid.

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
