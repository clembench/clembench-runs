Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X X<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s, where the ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid in a seemingly random pattern, with the exception of the bottom-left corner, where a ▢ is placed in the corner.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of X's and ▢'s, where the ▢'s are scattered throughout the grid in a seemingly random pattern, with some rows and columns having more ▢'s than others.\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows or columns in your grid that contain only ▢'s or only X's?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no rows or columns in my grid that contain only ▢'s or only X's.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the top row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the bottom row of your grid?<|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|><|eot_id|>",
