Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The empty squares in the bottom row of my grid are arranged randomly.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any X's in the first row of your grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are X's in the first row of my grid.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the first row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, there are no ▢'s in the first row of my grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the ▢'s in your grid limited to the first, third, and fifth rows, similar to my grid?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, the ▢'s in my grid are not limited to the first, third, and fifth rows.\nQUESTION: Are there any ▢'s in the last row of your grid? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there are ▢'s in the last row of your grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are the ▢'s in your grid all isolated, meaning they do not appear next to each other in any row or column?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: No, the ▢'s in my grid are not all isolated, but in my grid the ▢'s are in the first, third, and fifth rows.\nNow come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDECISION: different grids<|eot_id|>",
