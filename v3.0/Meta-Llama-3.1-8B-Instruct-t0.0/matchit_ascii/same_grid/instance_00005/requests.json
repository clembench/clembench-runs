Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\n▢ X X X ▢\n▢ ▢ X X ▢\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\n▢ X X ▢ ▢\n▢ X X X ▢<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of filled and empty squares, featuring a symmetrical pattern of filled squares on the left and right sides, with a single empty square in the middle row.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: A 5x5 grid with a mix of filled and empty squares, featuring a symmetrical pattern of filled squares on the left and right sides, with a single empty square in the middle row.\nQUESTION: Are the filled squares in your grid aligned with the edges of the grid, or are they offset from the edges? Start your answer with \"ANSWER:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: The filled squares in my grid are aligned with the edges of the grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNow ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my grid that may be different to your grid. Start with \"QUESTION:\" and do not add anything else.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nQUESTION: Are there any rows in your grid that contain three filled squares in a row?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nANSWER: Yes, there is a row in my grid that contains three filled squares in a row.\nQUESTION: Are there any filled squares in your grid that are directly above or below another filled square?

What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write \"DECISION: same grid\" if you think they are the same grid or \"DECISION: different grids\" if you think they are different grids.
