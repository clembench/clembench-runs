You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: club, suv, van, measles, aids, sword, scooter, flu, gun.\nYour opponent's team words are: minister, imam, plum, silver, archbishop, tangerine, copper, reverend.\nDistractor words are: violet, spade, italy, portugal, shears, indigo, gold.\nThe kill words are: mechanic. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like club, suv, van, measles, aids, sword, scooter, flu, gun. The goal is to come up with a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without using any of the words themselves or parts of them. Also, the clue can't be a distractor or kill word.\n\nFirst, I need to look for common themes or associations among the team's words. Let's list them again: club, suv, van, measles, aids, sword, scooter, flu, gun. Hmm. Let's see. \n\nLooking at the vehicles: club, suv, van, scooter. Wait, club is a place, but maybe \"club\" here refers to a vehicle? Or maybe it's a different meaning. SUV, van, scooter are all vehicles. So maybe \"vehicle\" is a theme for some. But club could be a different category. Let's check other words. Measles, aids, flu are diseases. Sword and gun are weapons. So there are multiple categories here: vehicles, diseases, weapons. \n\nThe challenge is to find a single word that connects several of these. Let's see. For diseases: measles, aids, flu. Maybe \"virus\"? But aids is caused by HIV, which is a virus, but measles is a virus too, flu is a virus. But \"virus\" might",
