You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: back, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda.\nYour opponent's team words are: copper, fist, titanium, sheep, horse, grenade, steel, bronze.\nDistractor words are: car, trailer, aluminum, oxygen, cave, dill, sage.\nThe kill words are: walnut. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like back, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nBack, scooter, ankle, cottonmouth, head, bus, rat, rv, anaconda.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Maybe something related to movement? Scooter and bus are vehicles. RV is a vehicle too. But back and head are body parts. Ankle is a body part. Rat and cottonmouth (a type of snake) are animals. Anaconda is a snake. Wait, cottonmouth is a type of snake, so maybe reptiles? But rat is a rodent. So maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, think of parts of vehicles. Scooter, bus, RV. Maybe \"vehicle\" but that's too broad. Or maybe \"ride\"? Like ride a scooter, ride a bus, ride an RV. But \"ride\" might not cover all. Back could be part of a vehicle seat? Not sure.\n\nBody parts: back, ankle, head. Rat and snake (cottonmouth, anaconda) – maybe animals? But rat is a rodent, snake is reptile. Not sure. Maybe",
