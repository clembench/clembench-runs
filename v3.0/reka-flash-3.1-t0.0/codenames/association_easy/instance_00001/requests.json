If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: wasp, wrench, awl, celery, moth, sander, chisel, kale, hornet.\nYour opponent's team words are: son, desk, chest, nephew, pants, nightstand, shirt, underwear.\nDistractor words are: parakeet, taser, finch, hammer, shotgun, mockingbird, penguin.\nThe kill words are: mumps. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like wasp, wrench, awl, celery, moth, sander, chisel, kale, hornet. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nWasp, wrench, awl, celery, moth, sander, chisel, kale, hornet.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Some of these are insects (wasp, moth, hornet). Others are tools (wrench, awl, chisel, sander). Then there's celery and kale, which are vegetables. Wait, maybe the vegetables are a separate group. Let's check:\n\nInsects: wasp, moth, hornet. Tools: wrench, awl, chisel, sander. Vegetables: celery, kale. Are there any other overlaps? Maybe not. So maybe the clue can target either the insects, the tools, or the vegetables. But the vegetables are only two words, so maybe better to go for insects or tools.\n\nLooking at the tools: wrench, awl, chisel, sander. What do they have in common? They are all hand tools, but maybe more specifically, they are all used for cutting or shaping. Alternatively, maybe they are all tools that",
