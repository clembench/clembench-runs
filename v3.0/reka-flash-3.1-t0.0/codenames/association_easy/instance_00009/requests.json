If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: wool, suede, satin, nuclear, alcohol, club, fleece, machete, bomb.\nYour opponent's team words are: quartz, glacier, scotland, island, peru, opal, cliff, ocean.\nDistractor words are: wagon, century, hour, green, king, millisecond, suv.\nThe kill words are: carbon. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like wool, suede, satin, nuclear, alcohol, club, fleece, machete, bomb. The opponent's words are quartz, glacier, scotland, island, peru, opal, cliff, ocean. Distractors are wagon, century, hour, green, king, millisecond, suv. The kill word is carbon.\n\nFirst, I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of the user's team words as possible. The clue can't be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them. Let's look at the user's words again: wool, suede, satin, nuclear, alcohol, club, fleece, machete, bomb.\n\nLooking for common themes. Wool, suede, satin, fleece are all fabrics. Nuclear and alcohol are substances, but maybe not directly related. Club could be a place or a weapon. Machete is a tool. Bomb is explosive. Hmm. Maybe the fabrics are the main group here. Let's see: wool, suede, satin, fleece. That's four words. If I can find a clue that relates to these four, that's a good start. \n\nWhat's the common word for these fabrics? Maybe \"fiber\" but that's too generic. \"Textile\" is another possibility, but maybe not. Alternatively, think of the material they're made from. Wool is from sheep,",
