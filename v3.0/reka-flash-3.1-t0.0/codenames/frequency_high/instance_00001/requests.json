You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: water, lawyer, coffee, life, apartment, lot, birthday, rock, box.\nYour opponent's team words are: moment, horse, minute, place, clothes, bar, house, baby.\nDistractor words are: kids, hair, building, case, captain, class, miles.\nThe kill words are: day. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like water, lawyer, coffee, life, apartment, lot, birthday, rock, box. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again: water, lawyer, coffee, life, apartment, lot, birthday, rock, box. Hmm. What do these have in common? Maybe something related to their uses or properties. \n\nWater is a liquid, coffee is a drink, life is abstract, apartment is a place, lot could be a quantity or a place, birthday is an event, rock is a mineral, box is a container. Lawyer is a profession. Not obvious. Maybe think of categories. \n\nWait, maybe \"container\"? Box is a container. What about others? Apartment is a container of sorts? Maybe not. Coffee and water are liquids, but containers are boxes. Hmm. Not enough. \n\nAnother angle: professions. Lawyer is a profession. Are there others? No. Maybe \"event\"? Birthday is an event. What else? Maybe \"place\"? Apartment, lot, house (but house is opponent's word). Not sure. \n\nWait, \"water\" and \"coffee\" are both beverages. \"Life\" could be a stretch. \"Rock\" is a type of music genre",
