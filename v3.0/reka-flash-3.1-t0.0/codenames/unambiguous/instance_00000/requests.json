If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: lighthouse, piranha, blazer, epilepsy, councilman, merger, riddance, tanker, graveyard.\nYour opponent's team words are: storeroom, affliction, bathrobe, cactus, thug, allergy, buzzer, lobotomy.\nDistractor words are: underwear, bathtub, spider, tornado, opponent, broker, greed.\nThe kill words are: adultery. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like lighthouse, piranha, blazer, epilepsy, councilman, merger, riddance, tanker, graveyard. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Lighthouse is a structure that guides ships. Piranha is a type of fish. Blazer is a type of jacket. Epilepsy is a medical condition. Councilman is a political position. Merger is a business term. Riddance means the removal of something. Tanker is a ship used for transporting liquids. Graveyard is a place where people are buried.\n\nLooking for connections: Lighthouse and tanker are both related to water or transportation. Piranha is a predator in water. Blazer might relate to clothing, but maybe not. Epilepsy is a medical term, councilman is political, merger is business. Riddance is abstract. Graveyard is a place. Maybe something related to water? Let's see: lighthouse, piranha, tanker. But blazer doesn't fit. Epilepsy, councilman, merger, riddance, graveyard don't. Maybe another angle.\n\nWait, \"blazer\" could be part of a team's uniform, like a sports jacket. But how does that connect? Maybe",
