If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: petroleum, pooch, morale, guile, puck, enzyme, adultery, cavalry, inventor.\nYour opponent's team words are: chimp, opponent, drifter, census, vial, courtroom, physicist, condom.\nDistractor words are: brat, motorcade, assailant, slipper, ultimatum, hypocrite, broker.\nThe kill words are: checkup. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like petroleum, pooch, morale, guile, puck, enzyme, adultery, cavalry, inventor. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the team words. Let's list them again: petroleum, pooch, morale, guile, puck, enzyme, adultery, cavalry, inventor. Hmm. Let's see if there are any obvious connections. \n\nPetroleum is a fossil fuel, right? So maybe something related to energy sources. But how does that connect to other words? Pooch is a dog. Morale is about spirit. Guile is trickiness. Puck is a puck, like in hockey. Enzyme is a biochemical. Adultery is cheating. Cavalry is soldiers on horseback. Inventor is someone who creates new things.\n\nLooking for a common thread. Let's think of categories. Maybe elements of nature? Petroleum is natural, but pooch is an animal. Morale is abstract. Guile is abstract. Puck is an object. Enzyme is science. Adultery is social. Cavalry is military. Inventor is human. Not obvious.\n\nWait, maybe think of parts of words. Petroleum has \"petro\" which is short for petroleum. But the clue can't contain",
