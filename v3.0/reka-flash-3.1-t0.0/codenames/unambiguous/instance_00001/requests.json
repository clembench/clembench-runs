If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: spider, periscope, titanium, laser, buzzer, geisha, spinach, cactus, ruse.\nYour opponent's team words are: serenity, overcoat, dusk, toothpick, melon, campus, walrus, potassium.\nDistractor words are: puck, ammo, cavalry, bayou, courtroom, luncheon, penguin.\nThe kill words are: bridegroom. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like spider, periscope, titanium, laser, buzzer, geisha, spinach, cactus, ruse. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Spider and geisha might be tricky. Spider is an animal, geisha is a cultural role. Titanium is a metal, laser is a technology term, buzzer is an object. Spinach and cactus are both plants. Periscope is a tool, ruse is a trick.\n\nLooking for overlaps: Maybe something related to tools or inventions? Periscope, titanium, laser, buzzer. Titanium is a strong metal, used in various things. Laser could be part of technology. Periscope uses reflection, maybe optics. Buzzer is an alert device. Hmm. Maybe \"optic\" relates to periscope and laser? But optic is a single word. Let's check: periscope uses optics, laser is light-based. Titanium is a metal, maybe not. Buzzer is electronic. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Spinach and cactus are both plants, but maybe \"vegetable\"? But spinach is a veg, cactus is a plant but sometimes considered a vegetable. However, the clue can't be \"vegetable\" if cactus isn",
