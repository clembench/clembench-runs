If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: serenity, vigilante, bathtub, daybreak, apartment, snowman, prairie, drugstore, stairway.\nYour opponent's team words are: psychopath, statute, mutt, enzyme, pond, census, hepatitis, egghead.\nDistractor words are: stewardess, blimp, appetizer, pharmacist, prom, geisha, shaman.\nThe kill words are: cowardice. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like serenity, vigilante, bathtub, daybreak, apartment, snowman, prairie, drugstore, stairway. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nSerenity – calm, peaceful.\nVigilante – someone who takes justice into their own hands, maybe related to watching or protecting.\nBathtub – a place for relaxing, water.\nDaybreak – morning, start of the day.\nApartment – a type of dwelling.\nSnowman – cold, winter, made of snow.\nPrairie – a large grassy plain, outdoors.\nDrugstore – a place to buy medicines and over-the-counter drugs.\nStairway – a structure for moving between floors.\n\nLooking for connections. Serenity and bathtub both relate to relaxation. Daybreak and prairie might be about mornings or nature. Apartment and drugstore are places. Snowman and stairway? Not sure. Vigilante is more about action. Maybe something like \"home\" for apartment, bathtub, maybe prairie? No, prairie is outdoors. Wait, apartment is a home, bathtub is part of a home. Drugstore is a commercial place. Snowman is a winter figure. Stairway is part",
