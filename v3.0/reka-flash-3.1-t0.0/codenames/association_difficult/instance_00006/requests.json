If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: mint, turkey, masher, yard, daffodil, bicycle, aunt, rosemary, onion.\nYour opponent's team words are: kilometer, meter, goose, tractor, rose, badminton, nephew, oregano.\nDistractor words are: tulip, peony, millimeter, grater, track, ostrich, father.\nThe kill words are: bowling. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like mint, turkey, masher, yard, daffodil, bicycle, aunt, rosemary, onion. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nmint, turkey, masher, yard, daffodil, bicycle, aunt, rosemary, onion.\n\nHmm. Let's see. Mint and rosemary are herbs. Turkey is a bird. Daffodil is a flower. Yard could relate to a garden or a place. Masher might be a kitchen tool. Bicycle is a vehicle. Aunt is a family member. Onion is a vegetable.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe kitchen tools? Masher and maybe onion (if thinking of chopping). But mint and rosemary are herbs, not kitchen tools. Turkey is a food. Daffodil is a plant. Yard could be a garden. Bicycle is transportation. Aunt is family. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe family? Aunt is family, but the others don't fit. Maybe cooking? Turkey, masher, onion, mint, rosemary. That's five words. Let's check: turkey (food), masher (kitchen tool for mashing), onion (vegetable), mint and rosemary (herbs used",
