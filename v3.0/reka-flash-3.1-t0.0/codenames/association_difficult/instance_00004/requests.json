You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: cedar, deacon, polyester, swan, gymnastics, france, birch, nitrogen, hat.\nYour opponent's team words are: hockey, mercury, peru, wool, swallow, christmas, bishop, nuclear.\nDistractor words are: ostrich, volleyball, korea, pine, pants, archbishop, acid.\nThe kill words are: coal. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like cedar, deacon, polyester, swan, gymnastics, france, birch, nitrogen, hat. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Cedar and birch are both types of trees. France is a country. Nitrogen is a chemical element. Gymnastics is a sport. Deacon is a religious role. Swan is a bird. Polyester is a synthetic material. Hat is an item of clothing. Hmm, not obvious connections here.\n\nWait, maybe some of these words can be associated with other categories. Let's see:\n\n- Cedar and birch: trees. Maybe \"wood\" but that's a distractor? Wait, the distractors are ostrich, volleyball, korea, pine, pants, archbishop, acid. Pine is a distractor, but cedar and birch are trees. If I use \"wood,\" but \"wood\" isn't in the lists. Wait, the clue can't be a word in the lists. Let me check the user's team words again. The user's team words are cedar, deacon, polyester, swan, gymnastics, france, birch, nitrogen, hat. None of these are \"wood,\" so maybe \"wood\" is a possible clue.",
