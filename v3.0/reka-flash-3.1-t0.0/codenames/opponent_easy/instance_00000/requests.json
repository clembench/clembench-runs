You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: marble, octopus, stadium, fish, cover, hospital, microscope, knight, berlin.\nYour opponent's team words are: fly, crane, turkey, copper, line, square, cell, tooth.\nDistractor words are: england, bell, degree, foot, wake, bill, state.\nThe kill words are: mammoth. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like marble, octopus, stadium, fish, cover, hospital, microscope, knight, Berlin. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's go through each word:\n\n- Marble: Could be stone, sculpture, art, etc.\n- Octopus: Sea creature, tentacles, squid.\n- Stadium: Sports venue, crowd, events.\n- Fish: Water, aquatic, swim.\n- Cover: Conceal, hide, protect.\n- Hospital: Medical, heal, sick.\n- Microscope: Science, magnify, observe.\n- Knight: Medieval, armor, sword.\n- Berlin: City, Germany, history.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe something related to tools or professions? Microscope and hospital relate to science/medicine. Knight is historical. Berlin is a place. Marble and octopus are more about objects/nature. Stadium and fish are places/animals. Cover is an action. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"glass\"? Let's see. Microscope uses glass lenses. Stadium might have glass structures? Not sure. Marble is stone, not glass. Octopus is an animal. Fish in aquariums might be in glass tanks. Hospital might have glass windows. Knight... no. Berlin? No. Cover? Maybe not",
