If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: square, bermuda, amazon, cycle, snowman, tower, dragon, robot, platypus.\nYour opponent's team words are: swing, dwarf, air, boom, doctor, file, disease, dress.\nDistractor words are: hand, engine, apple, fork, thief, pie, embassy.\nThe kill words are: shark. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like square, bermuda, amazon, cycle, snowman, tower, dragon, robot, platypus. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes or associations among the team words. Let's list them again: square, bermuda, amazon, cycle, snowman, tower, dragon, robot, platypus. \n\nLooking at these, some are places (square, bermuda, amazon), some are objects (cycle, tower), mythical creatures (dragon), animals (platypus, snowman?), robots (robot). Wait, snowman is a creature made of snow, so maybe not mythical. Hmm.\n\nPossible themes: Geography (bermuda, amazon, square?), but square is a shape. Maybe not. Alternatively, think of categories like \"mythical creatures\" but dragon is the only one. \"Inventions\" – cycle, robot, tower? Not sure. \"Weather\" – snowman, but others? Maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think of each word's possible associations. Square could be a chess piece, a shape, a public square. Bermuda is a triangle-shaped region, also known for the Bermuda Triangle. Amazon could be the river, the company, the rainforest. Cycle",
