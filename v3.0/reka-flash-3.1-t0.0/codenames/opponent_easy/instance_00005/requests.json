You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: india, watch, vacuum, draft, himalayas, marble, pie, bug, helicopter.\nYour opponent's team words are: fork, deck, china, organ, card, thief, mint, spike.\nDistractor words are: server, wall, car, cycle, shakespeare, ice, duck.\nThe kill words are: buffalo. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like India, watch, vacuum, draft, Himalayas, marble, pie, bug, helicopter. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. India and Himalayas are both geographical locations in Asia. Marble is a material, maybe related to sculpture or architecture. Watch could be a timepiece or something to observe. Vacuum is a cleaning appliance. Draft might refer to air movement or a document. Pie is food. Bug could be an insect or a computer error. Helicopter is a vehicle.\n\nHmm, maybe something related to natural phenomena? Or maybe materials? Let's see. Marble is a stone, Himalayas are mountains. India is a country. Maybe \"stone\"? But does that connect to others? Watch uses a stone (quartz?), but maybe not. Vacuum is about air, not stone. Draft could be a draft of a document, not stone. Pie is food. Bug and helicopter don't fit. Maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: \"natural\"? India has natural resources, Himalayas are natural. Marble is natural stone. But watch, vacuum, draft, pie, bug, helicopter are man-made or not natural. Maybe not the best.\n\nWait, \"draft\" can also mean a current of air. So maybe \"air\"?",
