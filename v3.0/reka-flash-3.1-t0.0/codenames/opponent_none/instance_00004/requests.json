If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: note, bell, hawk, antarctica, shadow, dragon, bank, ship, phoenix.\nYour opponent's team words are: file, park, straw, tie, film, england, horn, mexico.\nDistractor words are: whip, model, brush, bar, swing, capital, day.\nThe kill words are: club. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like note, bell, hawk, antarctica, shadow, dragon, bank, ship, phoenix. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes or associations among the team words. Let's list them again: note, bell, hawk, antarctica, shadow, dragon, bank, ship, phoenix. Hmm. Let's see:\n\n- Note: Could relate to music (note), writing, or something else.\n- Bell: Sound, church, time (like a bell tower), or maybe a bicycle bell.\n- Hawk: Bird of prey, maybe also a brand name (Hawk Electronics?), or something related to hunting.\n- Antarctica: The continent, cold, penguins, maybe exploration.\n- Shadow: Dark, following someone, or in photography.\n- Dragon: Mythical creature, fire, maybe games or books.\n- Bank: Financial institution, river bank, or the side of a river.\n- Ship: Transportation, sailing, maritime.\n- Phoenix: Mythical bird that rises from ashes, rebirth.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe something related to mythology? Dragon and phoenix are both mythical. But how about other words? Shadow could be part of a myth, but not sure. Antarctica is a real place. Bank and ship are",
