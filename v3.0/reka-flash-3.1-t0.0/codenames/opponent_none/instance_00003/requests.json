You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: sound, fair, teacher, band, dragon, cast, star, africa, crown.\nYour opponent's team words are: pass, march, pole, watch, fan, compound, ice, straw.\nDistractor words are: battery, seal, london, helicopter, deck, luck, bar.\nThe kill words are: box. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like sound, fair, teacher, band, dragon, cast, star, africa, crown. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nSound: Maybe related to music, hearing, etc. But how does that connect to others?\nFair: Could be justice, market, event. Maybe not obvious.\nTeacher: Education, school, students.\nBand: Music group, or a strip of material. Also a military unit.\nDragon: Mythical creature, fire-breathing.\nCast: To throw, or a group of actors, or a medical cast.\nStar: Celestial body, famous person, in movies.\nAfrica: Continent.\nCrown: Headwear, monarchy, jewelry.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Let's see:\n\n- Band and cast both relate to groups (musical band, acting cast).\n- Star and crown could relate to royalty (star as a symbol, crown as literal).\n- Africa might be tricky. Maybe something like \"continent\" but that's too generic. Or maybe \"wildlife\" but that's not in the list.\n- Teacher and cast? Not sure. Teacher is about education, cast is about acting or throwing.\n- Sound and band (music), but maybe not directly.\n",
