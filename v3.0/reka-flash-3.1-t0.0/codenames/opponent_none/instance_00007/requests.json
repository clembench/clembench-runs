You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: bond, tie, moon, string, czech, row, casino, concert, link.\nYour opponent's team words are: bark, beat, platypus, pyramid, hotel, alien, robin, centaur.\nDistractor words are: pass, belt, leprechaun, star, eye, tag, mug.\nThe kill words are: ninja. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like bond, tie, moon, string, czech, row, casino, concert, link. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Bond and tie are both about connecting things. String and link also relate to connecting or tying. Moon might be a stretch, but maybe something related to celestial? Czech could be tricky. Row is about being in a line or arguing. Casino and concert are both places or events. Hmm.\n\nWait, bond, tie, string, link all involve connections. Moon... maybe not. Czech is a country. Row could be a line or conflict. Casino and concert are different. Maybe \"connect\" is too generic. Let's see. Bond (as in connect), tie, string, link. That's four. What else? Maybe \"knot\"? But knot is a part of a string. Wait, the clue can't contain parts of the target words. So \"knot\" is part of \"string\"? No, \"knot\" is a separate word but part of the string's usage. Maybe not. Alternatively, \"tie\" is a knot, but the clue can't be \"knot\" because it's part of \"string\"? Wait, the rule says the clue cannot contain parts of",
