You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: hospital, mine, rock, play, satellite, tap, bear, atlantis, canada.\nYour opponent's team words are: shop, boom, palm, jet, spider, police, scientist, horseshoe.\nDistractor words are: snow, contract, yard, horse, plate, lab, bark, racket.\nThe kill words are:. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like hospital, mine, rock, play, satellite, tap, bear, atlantis, canada. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Hospital and mine both involve digging or extraction. Rock is a material used in mining. Tap could relate to water sources, maybe a mine's water tap? Bear might be a stretch, but maybe something like \"grizzly\" but that's a type of bear. Atlantis is a mythical city under water. Canada is a country with natural resources. Satellite is in space. Play could be a stretch, maybe \"game\" but that's not here. Rock as a musical genre? Not sure. \n\nWait, \"mine\" can also mean a trap, but that's more like a landmine. Hospital and mine (the place) both involve digging. Rock is a mineral found in mines. Tap could be a water tap, maybe related to mines? Atlantis is underwater. Canada has natural resources. Satellite is in space. Bear could be associated with \"grizzly\" but that's not in the list. Maybe \"grill\" but that's not here. \n\nAlternatively, think of \"gravel\" but that's not in the list. Wait, \"rock\" and \"mine\" are both related to",
