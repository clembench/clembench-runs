If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack.\nYour opponent's team words are: boom, squash, count, pit, shock, pawn, hitch, nip.\nDistractor words are: pipe, strand, strip, crash, spill, rib, vault.\nThe kill words are: fry. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes or associations among the team words. Let's list them again: slack, glare, beetle, blow, stall, plot, cramp, rush, smack. Hmm. Let's see:\n\n- Slack: could relate to relaxation, not tight, maybe verbs like let go.\n- Glare: intense look, maybe eyes, brightness.\n- Beetle: insect, maybe bugs, or something that crawls.\n- Blow: wind, hit, loud noise.\n- Stall: stop, delay, or a place where horses are kept.\n- Plot: plan, story, or a garden plot.\n- Cramp: muscle pain, tightness.\n- Rush: hurry, flow, water current.\n- Smack: hit with force, sound.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe \"tight\"? Slack is the opposite of tight. Cramp is tightness. But does that work? Let's see. Are there other words? Maybe \"stop\" for stall, but stall can also mean a place. Hmm. \"Blow\" and \"rush\" might relate to force or movement. \"Smack\" is a hit.",
