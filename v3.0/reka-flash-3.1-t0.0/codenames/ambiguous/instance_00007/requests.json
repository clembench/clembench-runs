If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: lash, fly, jar, fry, slack, stalk, jam, buff, stick.\nYour opponent's team words are: grave, bluff, strand, blow, bull, bolt, settle, vault.\nDistractor words are: trace, spill, scale, pit, lime, beetle, squash.\nThe kill words are: pool. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: lash, fly, jar, fry, slack, stalk, jam, buff, stick. The opponent's words are grave, bluff, strand, blow, bull, bolt, settle, vault. Distractors are trace, spill, scale, pit, lime, beetle, squash. The kill word is pool.\n\nFirst, I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of the user's team words as possible. The clue can't be any of the listed words or contain parts of them. Let's look at the user's words again: lash, fly, jar, fry, slack, stalk, jam, buff, stick.\n\nLooking for common themes. Let's see:\n\n- Lash: Could relate to hitting, whipping, maybe \"whip\" but that's a part of lash. Maybe \"strike\"? But not sure.\n- Fly: Insect, or to fly as in move through air. Maybe \"air\" but that's too vague.\n- Jar: Container, or the sound. Maybe \"sound\" but not sure.\n- Fry: Cooking method, or fly (as in fried fly). Maybe \"cook\" but not all words fit.\n- Slack: Lack of tension, or to slacken. Maybe \"loose\" but not all.\n- Stalk: To follow secretly, or the plant stalk. Maybe \"follow\" but not all.\n",
