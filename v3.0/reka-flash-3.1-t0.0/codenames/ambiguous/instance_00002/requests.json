If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: poop, beetle, squash, peep, pink, meter, rush, plot, rocket.\nYour opponent's team words are: pump, gag, flush, bowl, stick, pawn, sap, repair.\nDistractor words are: corn, scale, lean, nag, stem, box, clip.\nThe kill words are: weed. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: poop, beetle, squash, peep, pink, meter, rush, plot, rocket. The opponent's words are pump, gag, flush, bowl, stick, pawn, sap, repair. Distractors are corn, scale, lean, nag, stem, box, clip. The kill word is weed.\n\nFirst, I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of the user's team words as possible. The clue can't be any of the listed words or contain parts of them. Let's look at the user's words again: poop, beetle, squash, peep, pink, meter, rush, plot, rocket.\n\nLooking for common themes. Let's see:\n\n- Poop: Maybe related to animals, waste, but not sure.\n- Beetle: Insect, maybe part of a larger category.\n- Squash: Could be a type of vegetable, or the action of squashing.\n- Peep: Sound, like a bird or a quick look.\n- Pink: Color, or maybe a type of flower.\n- Meter: Measuring device, like speedometer or water meter.\n- Rush: Speed, urgency, or a type of plant.\n- Plot: Storyline, garden plot, or a plan.\n- Rocket: Space vehicle, projectile.\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a common theme. Maybe \"sound\"? Peep",
