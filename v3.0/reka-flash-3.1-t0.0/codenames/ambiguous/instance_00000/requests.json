You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: buffer, slack, glare, peep, rack, repair, swarm, stalk, peel.\nYour opponent's team words are: scrub, paste, host, fry, spell, rock, pawn, tip.\nDistractor words are: pool, pad, strip, shock, rush, rag, fold.\nThe kill words are: drone. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like buffer, slack, glare, peep, rack, repair, swarm, stalk, peel. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each word and see possible connections. Let's list them out:\n\nBuffer: Could relate to something that buffers or absorbs, like a cushion. But maybe other angles? Like in computing, a buffer is a temporary storage area. Not sure.\n\nSlack: Could be the opposite of tension, or the messaging app. Maybe \"slack\" as in having extra time? Or \"slack\" as in a loose part.\n\nGlare: Bright light, intense stare, maybe something that reflects light.\n\nPeep: To look quickly, a small hole, or a bird. Maybe \"peep\" as in a small sound.\n\nRack: A structure to hold things, like a coat rack. Or rack in math (like a set of numbers). Or rack as in pain (racked with pain). Or in poker, a rack of cards? Not sure.\n\nRepair: Fixing something, mending.\n\nSwarm: A group of insects, like bees.\n\nStalk: To follow secretly, or the part of a plant below the flower.\n\nPeel: Remove the outer layer, like an orange.\n\nLooking for common themes",
