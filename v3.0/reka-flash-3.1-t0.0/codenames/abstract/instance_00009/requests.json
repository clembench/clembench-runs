If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: impunity, sexism, refutation, faithfulness, goodness, reconsideration, vindication, selectivity, repentance.\nYour opponent's team words are: communicability, likelihood, interconnection, ability, imprecision, discernment, coercion, modularity.\nDistractor words are: insentient, resourcefulness, veracity, exclusivity, savagery, symbolism, adage.\nThe kill words are: formality. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like impunity, sexism, refutation, faithfulness, goodness, reconsideration, vindication, selectivity, repentance. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nImpunity: getting away with something without punishment.\nSexism: discrimination based on gender.\nRefutation: disproving something.\nFaithfulness: being loyal or faithful.\nGoodness: moral quality of being virtuous.\nReconsideration: thinking again about a decision.\nVindication: proving someone is right or justified.\nSelectivity: choosing carefully; not accepting everything.\nRepentance: feeling remorse or regret.\n\nLooking for connections. Some of these words relate to morality, justice, ethics. Words like faithfulness, goodness, repentance are about moral behavior. Impunity, vindication, refutation might relate to justice or legal aspects. Sexism and selectivity could be about fairness or discrimination. Reconsideration is about changing one's mind.\n\nWait, maybe \"moral\" is a possible clue? Let's check. Does \"moral\" relate to all the user's words? Impunity could be seen as a moral issue. Sexism is definitely moral. Refutation might be more about argumentation. Faithfulness,",
