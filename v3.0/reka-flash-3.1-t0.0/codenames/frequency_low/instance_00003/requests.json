If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite.\nYour opponent's team words are: hurdler, assassinator, emotionality, liquidness, bagpiper, deinstitutionalization, housewifery, perpetration.\nDistractor words are: bandmaster, ladylove, customizer, defenseman, narrowness, hotelkeeper, neckband.\nThe kill words are: seacoast. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has nine words: eggroll, scrubwoman, plantain, banquette, muddiness, unchallenging, moviemaker, hypersensitivity, typewrite. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each word to see possible connections. Let's list them again:\n\n1. eggroll - Maybe something related to food, rolling, or cooking?\n2. scrubwoman - Could be cleaning, a person, or maybe \"woman\" as a clue?\n3. plantain - A type of banana, maybe related to food or tropical?\n4. banquette - Furniture, seating?\n5. muddiness - Related to mud, wetness, or something slippery?\n6. unchallenging - Opposite of challenging, maybe easy?\n7. moviemaker - Film industry, director, actor?\n8. hypersensitivity - Allergy, sensitive, overreaction?\n9. typewrite - Writing, old technology, keyboard?\n\nLooking for common themes. Let's see:\n\n- Eggroll and plantain are both food items. Maybe \"food\" but that's too broad. Alternatively, maybe \"asian\" since eggroll is common in Asian cuisine, plantain is a tropical fruit. But \"asian\" might not cover all.\n\n- Scr",
