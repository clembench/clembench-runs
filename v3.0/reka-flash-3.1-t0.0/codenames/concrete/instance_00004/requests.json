You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: thermometer, bikini, ear, canister, armchair, island, videocassette, snowsuit, blackbird.\nYour opponent's team words are: necktie, bulb, blender, walrus, burger, rafter, tail, spear.\nDistractor words are: mirror, yacht, bird, footstool, rattlesnake, teapot, daffodil.\nThe kill words are: escalator. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like thermometer, bikini, ear, canister, armchair, island, videocassette, snowsuit, blackbird. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words themselves or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes or associations. Let's go through each word:\n\nThermometer: Measures temperature, maybe related to heat or cold. But how else? Maybe \"measure\" but that's too generic. Or \"glass\" since thermometers are often glass tubes. But glass is a distractor word? Wait, no, the distractors are mirror, yacht, bird, footstool, rattlesnake, teapot, daffodil. So glass isn't a distractor. But thermometer's main parts are glass, mercury, etc. Maybe \"glass\" could work, but does it relate to others?\n\nBikini: A type of clothing, maybe \"swimwear\" but that's two words. Or \"fabric\"? Not sure. Bikini is also associated with beaches, sun, maybe \"bathing\" but again, two words. Alternatively, \"strap\" but that's part of it. Hmm.\n\nEar: Part of the body. Maybe \"hearing\" but that's two words. Or \"auricle\"? No, that's too technical. Maybe",
