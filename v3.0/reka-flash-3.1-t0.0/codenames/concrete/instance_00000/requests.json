You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: kite, horn, strawberry, coat, rope, handgun, gorilla, hotdog, donkey.\nYour opponent's team words are: pantyhose, maggot, chipmunk, margarita, cotton, hair, cave, snowplow.\nDistractor words are: seesaw, stroller, snowsuit, envelope, jeans, suitcase, hairnet.\nThe kill words are: lawnmower. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like kite, horn, strawberry, coat, rope, handgun, gorilla, hotdog, donkey. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Kite and hotdog both have \"hot\" in them, but that might be too obvious. Wait, maybe not. Let's see. Kite is flown in the sky, maybe something related to flying? But horn is part of an animal, like a cow's horn. Strawberry is a fruit. Coat is clothing. Rope is an object. Handgun is a weapon. Gorilla is an animal. Hotdog is food. Donkey is an animal.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Maybe something related to animals? Gorilla, donkey, horn (animal part), maybe coat (as in animal coat?), but coat here is clothing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe food items: strawberry, hotdog. But how to connect them? Maybe \"snack\"? But strawberry isn't a snack, though. Or \"red\"? Strawberry is red, but that might not cover others.\n\nWait, another angle: parts of the body. Horn is a body part. Gorilla has a face, but not sure. Donkey's ears? Not sure. Maybe not. How about \"animal\"? Gorilla",
