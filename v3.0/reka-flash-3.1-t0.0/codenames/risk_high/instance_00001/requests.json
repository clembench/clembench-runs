You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: spine, missile, luck, ground, moon, train, string, line, post.\nYour opponent's team words are: stadium, sub, dinosaur, nut, olive, witch, chair, lemon.\nDistractor words are: greece, strike, satellite.\nThe kill words are: shark, shot, tag, cloak, tablet. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: spine, missile, luck, ground, moon, train, string, line, post. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\nSpine, missile, luck, ground, moon, train, string, line, post.\n\nLooking for connections. Spine and line? Maybe. Spine is part of the body, line could be a line of people or a straight line. Missile and line? Maybe trajectory? But that's not a single word. Train and line? Trains run on lines. String and line? Both are lines. Post and line? Like a post and line in a fence or telephone line. Ground and line? Maybe ground line in sports? Moon and line? Lunar eclipse has a line? Not sure. Luck... Hmm, how does luck connect? Maybe \"chance\" but that's not a single word. Wait, maybe \"line\" is a common thread here. Let's check:\n\nSpine: Maybe the spinal line? Or a line in a book? Not sure. Missile: Maybe a line of fire? Train: Trains on lines. String: Lines of string. Post: Post and line (like a post and line fence). Ground: Ground line",
