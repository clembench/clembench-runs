You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: pitch, gold, well, cook, australia, line, pass, turkey, palm.\nYour opponent's team words are: fork, centaur, telescope, shakespeare, press, whip, foot, kangaroo.\nDistractor words are: plastic, rome, server.\nThe kill words are: watch, pool, stock, swing, part. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: pitch, gold, well, cook, australia, line, pass, turkey, palm. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them. Also, the clue can't be a distractor or kill word.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\npitch: could be the act of pitching a ball, or the substance used in roofing. Maybe also the verb to pitch a tent.\ngold: precious metal, Olympic sport (golf?), or the color.\nwell: a water well, or doing well.\ncook: the person, the action, or cooking equipment.\naustralia: the country, kangaroos, maybe the continent.\nline: a row of things, a phone line, a queue.\npass: to hand over, a football pass, to pass a test.\nturkey: the bird, the country, or the holiday meal.\npalm: the tree, the hand's palm, or palm reading.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Let's see:\n\n- Australia and kangaroo are opponent's words, so not relevant here. Distractors are plastic, Rome, server. Kill words are watch, pool, stock, swing, part. So the clue can't be any of those.\n\nLooking for possible connections. Let's see:\n\n",
