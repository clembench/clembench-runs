You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: round, time, racket, trunk, ketchup, millionaire, capital, circle, back.\nYour opponent's team words are: worm, tooth, torch, board, spy, ground, card, watch.\nDistractor words are: eagle, olympus, lion.\nThe kill words are: suit, paper, post, missile, pipe. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: round, time, racket, trunk, ketchup, millionaire, capital, circle, back. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's list out the team words again to see patterns. Round and circle are both shapes. Time and back might be related to directions or concepts. Racket could be a sports item, trunk is part of a car or an animal, ketchup is a condiment, millionaire is a person, capital is a city or a financial term. Hmm, not obvious connections.\n\nLooking for overlaps. Round and circle are definitely shapes. Time could relate to circular (like a clock), but maybe not. Back might relate to circular in some contexts? Racket—maybe \"net\" as in tennis, but that's not in the list. Trunk—maybe \"car\" but that's not here. Ketchup is a red sauce, maybe \"color\"? Millionaire could relate to \"money\" or \"wealth\". Capital as a city or as a financial term. \n\nWait, \"round\" and \"circle\" are both shapes. \"Time\" could be a \"loop\" or \"cycle\", but maybe not. \"Back\" could be part of a circle? Not sure. \"Capital\" as a city might relate to \"round\"",
