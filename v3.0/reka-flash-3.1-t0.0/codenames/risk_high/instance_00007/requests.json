You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: pipe, file, bow, mouth, watch, force, shoe, lock, embassy.\nYour opponent's team words are: mass, jam, switch, pole, hood, spring, limousine, engine.\nDistractor words are: duck, server, london.\nThe kill words are: train, calf, bank, bar, soul. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: pipe, file, bow, mouth, watch, force, shoe, lock, embassy. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes. Let's list out the words again:\n\npipe, file, bow, mouth, watch, force, shoe, lock, embassy.\n\nLooking for connections. Pipe and lock both have something to do with mechanisms or tools. File is a tool, maybe. Bow could be a bow and arrow or the front of a ship. Mouth is obvious. Watch is a timepiece. Force could be physical force or military. Shoe is footwear. Embassy is a diplomatic building.\n\nHmm. Maybe something related to tools? Pipe, file, lock, shoe, watch, force (maybe not). Alternatively, maybe parts of the body? Mouth is a body part. Shoe is part of the body. Maybe not. \n\nWait, pipe and lock are both things you put keys in? Or maybe pipe and lock are both mechanical? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of homonyms or different meanings. For example, \"bow\" can be a weapon or the front part of a ship. \"Pipe\" can be a tube or a musical instrument. \"File\" can be a tool or a computer file. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother angle",
