You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: swing, calf, horn, cell, stream, spine, bar, fair, straw.\nYour opponent's team words are: cycle, poison, wave, hood, compound, alien, olive, missile.\nDistractor words are: suit, bell, embassy, bear, point, state, shakespeare.\nThe kill words are: whip. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words: swing, calf, horn, cell, stream, spine, bar, fair, straw. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, I'll look for common themes or associations. Let's list out the words again:\n\nSwing: Could relate to movement, like a pendulum, or maybe a swing set. But maybe other meanings? Like swinging a bat in baseball.\n\nCalf: Part of the leg, or the young of a cow. Maybe \"baby\" but that's too vague.\n\nHorn: The part of an animal, or a musical instrument, or a car horn. Also, \"horn\" as in a shape like a spiral.\n\nCell: A prison cell, a cell in biology, a phone cell. Or \"cell\" as in a small room.\n\nStream: Water flowing, a stream of consciousness, or a stream as in a video stream.\n\nSpine: The backbone, or the spine of a book.\n\nBar: A counter, a bar of soap, a bar of music (like a measure), or a bar as in a nightclub.\n\nFair: An event, fair weather, fair trade, or \"fair\" as in just.\n\nStraw: The plant, a straw for drinking, or straw as in straw hat.\n\nLooking for overlaps.
