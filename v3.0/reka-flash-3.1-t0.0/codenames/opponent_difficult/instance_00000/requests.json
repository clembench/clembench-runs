You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: missile, button, cap, time, novel, straw, server, himalayas, spy.\nYour opponent's team words are: ice, car, shot, piano, lion, bank, fork, strike.\nDistractor words are: beach, gold, bridge, whip, pumpkin, change, bill.\nThe kill words are: space. <sep> assistant:",

The user's team has words like missile, button, cap, time, novel, straw, server, himalayas, spy. I need to find a single-word clue that relates to as many of these as possible without being one of the words or containing parts of them.\n\nFirst, let's look for common themes. Missile and spy both relate to espionage or military. Button and cap could be parts of a uniform or clothing. Time and novel might be abstract. Straw could be a material or something you drink from. Server is a computer term. Himalayas is a mountain range. Hmm, maybe not obvious.\n\nWait, missile and spy both involve some form of targeting or surveillance. Button and cap—maybe something like \"gear\" or \"uniform\"? But \"gear\" might not fit. Alternatively, \"button\" could relate to a button on a device, but cap is a hat. Maybe \"accessory\"? But that's too vague.\n\nTime and novel—maybe \"story\"? A novel is a story, but time is more abstract. Maybe \"measure\"? Time is measured, but novel isn't. Not sure.\n\nStraw and server: straw is for drinking, server is for providing. Maybe \"supply\"? Not quite. Server could be related to \"network\" or \"tech\", straw is more everyday.\n\nHimalayas is a place. Spy might be in a high place? Maybe \"heights\"? But",
