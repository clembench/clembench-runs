My task is to describe it in a way that someone else can compare with their grid. Let me start by visualizing the grid.\n\nFirst, let's break down each row:\n\nRow 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: X X ▢ ▢ X\nRow 3: X ▢ X ▢ X\nRow 4: X ▢ ▢ X X\nRow 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n\nSo each row starts and ends with X, and the middle positions vary. The challenge is to describe this structure clearly. Maybe I can note the positions of the Xs and ▢s. Alternatively, describe the pattern in terms of symmetry or specific shapes.\n\nLooking at the grid, the first and last rows are similar, with Xs at the ends and three ▢s in between. The second row has two Xs at the start, then two ▢s, then an X. The third row alternates X and ▢, but let's check: X, then ▢, then X, then ▢, then X. Wait, no. Wait, the third row is X ▢ X ▢ X. So positions 1,3,5 are X, and 2,4 are �",
