The user provided a grid that looks like a 5x5 grid with some X's and a ▢. Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe first row is X X X X ▢. So that's four X's followed by a ▢. Then the second row is X X X ▢ X. So three X's, a ▢, then an X. Third row: X X ▢ X X. Two X's, a ▢, two X's. Fourth row: X ▢ X X X. One X, a ▢, three X's. Fifth row: ▢ X X X X. A ▢ followed by four X's.\n\nWait, let me check each row again to make sure I didn't mix up the positions. Let's count each character per row:\n\nRow 1: X, X, X, X, ▢\nRow 2: X, X, X, ▢, X\nRow 3: X, X, ▢, X, X\nRow 4: X, ▢, X, X, X\nRow 5: ▢, X, X, X, X\n\nYes, that's correct. Each row has five elements. The ▢ is in different positions in each row. Let me note the positions of the ▢ in each row. Starting from the top:\n\nRow",
