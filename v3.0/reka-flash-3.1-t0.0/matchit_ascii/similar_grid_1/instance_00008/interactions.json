Wait, let me count again. First row: positions 1,2,3,4,5. The third position is X. Second row same. Third row is all empty. Fourth and fifth rows again third position X. So the X's form a vertical line in the third column, except the third row is empty. So it's like a vertical line but missing the middle one. So positions (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3). Wait, no, the third row is all empty. So the X's are in rows 1,2,4,5, column 3. So that's four X's in a vertical line but skipping the third row. So like a broken vertical line. So",
