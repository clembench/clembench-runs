The user provided a 5x5 grid with some Xs and empty spaces. My task is to describe it in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly. I'll start by looking at each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢. So that's three empty squares, then an X, then two more empty. Wait, no, let me count again. Each row has five elements. The first row is two empty, then X, then two empty? Wait, no. Let me check again. The first row is written as \"▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\". So positions 1: ▢, 2: ▢, 3: X, 4: ▢, 5: ▢. So the X is in the third position of the first row.\n\nSecond row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. So positions 1: ▢, 2: X, 3: X, 4: ▢, 5: ▢. So two Xs starting from the second position.\n\nThird row: X X X X X. That's all Xs. So the entire third row is filled.\n\nFourth row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. Similar to the second row but shifted. Position 2 and 3 are Xs.\n\nFifth row:",
