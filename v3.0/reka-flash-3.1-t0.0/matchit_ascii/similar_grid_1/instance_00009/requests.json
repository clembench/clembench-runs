The user provided a grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe grid has 5 rows. Let's break it down row by row:\n\n1st row: X X X X X – all X's.\n2nd row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – starts with X, then four ▢'s.\n3rd row: X X X ▢ ▢ – first three X's, then two ▢'s.\n4th row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – similar to the second row, X followed by four ▢'s.\n5th row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – same as the fourth row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first row is all X's. The second and fourth rows start with X and then have four ▢'s. The third row has three X's followed by two ▢'s. The fifth row is the same as the fourth. Wait, but the user wrote the fifth row as X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢, which is X followed by four ▢'s. So rows 2,4,5 are similar but row 3 is different.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nRow 1: 5 X's.\n\nRow 2: X followed by four ▢'s.\n\nRow",
