	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me visualize it first.\\ \tt \\ \tt The grid has 5 rows. Let's break it down row by row:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1st row: X X X X X – all X's.\\ \tt 2nd row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – starts with X, then four ▢'s.\\ \tt 3rd row: X X X ▢ ▢ – first three X's, then two ▢'s.\\ \tt 4th row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – similar to the second row, X followed by four ▢'s.\\ \tt 5th row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ – same as the fourth row.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the pattern seems to be that the first row is all X's. The second and fourth rows start with X and then have four ▢'s. The third row has three X's followed by two ▢'s. The fifth row is the same as the fourth. Wait, but the user wrote the fifth row as X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢, which is X followed by four ▢'s. So rows 2,4,5 are similar but row 3 is different.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me check again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: 5 X's.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: X followed by four ▢'s.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row
