The grid looks like a diagonal of Xs from the bottom-left to the top-right. Let me check each row:\n\nFirst row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X → So the last column has an X.\nSecond row: ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢ → The fourth column has an X.\nThird row: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ → The third column has an X.\nFourth row: ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢ → The second column has an X.\nFifth row: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ → The first column has an X.\n\nWait, that's a diagonal from the fifth row first column to the first row fifth column? Wait, no. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: Columns 1-4 are empty, column 5 is X.\nRow 2: Columns 1-3 empty, column 4 X, column 5 empty.\nRow 3: Columns 1-2 empty, column 3 X, others empty.\nRow 4: Columns 1 empty, column 2 X, others empty.\nRow 5: Column 1 X, others empty.\n\nSo the positions of Xs are (1,5), (2,4), (",
