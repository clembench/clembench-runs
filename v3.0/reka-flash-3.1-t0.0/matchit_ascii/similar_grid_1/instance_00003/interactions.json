Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. Let me write it out row by row:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 3: ▢ X X X ▢\nRow 4: ▢ X X X ▢\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the first two rows have an X in the third column. Then rows 3 and 4 have X's starting from the second column up to the fourth. The fifth row is all X's.\n\nI need to describe this in a way that someone else can reconstruct. Maybe mention the positions of the X's. Alternatively, describe the shape. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the pattern: the first two rows have a single X in the middle. Then rows 3 and 4 have a horizontal line of X's starting from the second to fourth columns. The fifth row is a full row of X's. So it's like a diamond shape with a horizontal bar in the middle and a full bottom row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe count the number of X's in each row. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1 X\nRow 2: 1 X\nRow 3:",
