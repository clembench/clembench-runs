	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ X ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a 5x5 grid with some X's and empty squares (▢). My task is to describe it in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly. I'll start by looking at each row one by one.\\ \tt \\ \tt First row: ▢ X X X ▢. So the first and fifth positions are empty, and the middle three are X's. That's straightforward.\\ \tt \\ \tt Second row: ▢ ▢ X X ▢. Here, the first two and last positions are empty, and the third and fourth are X's.\\ \tt \\ \tt Third row: ▢ X ▢ X ▢. The pattern here is empty, X, empty, X, empty. So alternating X's starting from the second position.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fourth row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. First position is empty, second and third are X's, then two empty at the end.\\ \tt \\ \tt Fifth row: ▢ X X X ▢. Similar to the first row but shifted. First and last empty, middle three X's.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't mix up any positions. Let's index them from 1 to 5 for each row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: Positions 1: ▢, 2: X, 3: X, 4: X, 5: ▢. Correct.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: 1
