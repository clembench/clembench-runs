The user provided a grid with five rows and five columns. Each cell is either a blank (▢) or an X. My task is to describe this grid in a way that someone else can understand and compare it to their own grid.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the grid.

Let me check each row for X positions.\n\nRow 1: All blanks. So positions 1-5 are empty.\n\nRow 2: The first cell is blank, then four Xs. So positions 2-5 are Xs.\n\nRow 3: First three are blanks, then two Xs. Positions 4-5 are Xs.\n\nRow 4: First cell blank, then four Xs. Positions 2-5 are Xs.\n\nRow 5: First cell blank, then four Xs. Positions 2-5 are Xs.\n\nWait, but looking at rows 4 and 5, they both start with a blank and then four Xs. So",
