The first four rows are all filled with X's, and the fifth row has some ▢ symbols. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's input:\n\nX X X X X  \nX X X X X  \n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢  \nX X X X X  \nX X X X X  \n\nSo, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all X's. The third row has two ▢, then an X, then two more ▢. Wait, let me count the columns. Each row has five elements. So row 3 is positions 1: ▢, 2: ▢, 3: X, 4: ▢, 5: ▢. So the third row has X in the middle and ▢s on the sides.\n\nSo the description needs to clearly state that. Maybe start by saying it's a 5x5 grid. Then mention the positions of the ▢s. Alternatively, describe each row. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nFirst, confirm the grid size. The user's grid has 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So 5x5 grid. Then, rows 1, 2, 4, 5 are all X's. Row 3 has ▢ in columns",
