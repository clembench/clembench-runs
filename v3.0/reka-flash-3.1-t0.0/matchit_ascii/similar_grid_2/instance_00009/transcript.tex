	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X X X X X

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a grid with five rows. The first four rows are all filled with X's, and the fifth row has some ▢ symbols. Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the user's input:\\ \tt \\ \tt X X X X X  \\ \tt X X X X X  \\ \tt ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢  \\ \tt X X X X X  \\ \tt X X X X X  \\ \tt \\ \tt So, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all X's. The third row has two ▢, then an X, then two more ▢. Wait, let me count the columns. Each row has five elements. So row 3 is positions 1: ▢, 2: ▢, 3: X, 4: ▢, 5: ▢. So the third row has X in the middle and ▢s on the sides.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the description needs to clearly state that. Maybe start by saying it's a 5x5 grid. Then mention the positions of the ▢s. Alternatively, describe each row. Let me structure it step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, confirm the grid size. The user's grid has 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So 5x5 grid. Then, rows 1, 2, 4, 5 are all X's. Row 3 has ▢ in columns
