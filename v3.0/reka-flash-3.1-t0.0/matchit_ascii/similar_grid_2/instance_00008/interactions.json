The first four rows each have four X's, but the first cell in each of those rows is a ▢. The fifth row is all ▢s.\n\nWait, let me check again. The user's grid is:\n\n▢ X X X X  \n▢ X X X X  \n▢ X X X X  \n▢ X X X X  \n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢  \n\nSo each of the first four rows starts with a ▢ followed by four X's. The fifth row is five ▢s. So the grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. The first four rows have a pattern of ▢ followed by four X's. The fifth row is all empty squares.\n\nNow, the user is asking me to describe my grid. Wait, no. Wait, the user says: \"This is your grid:\" and then shows that grid. Wait, maybe I'm confused.
