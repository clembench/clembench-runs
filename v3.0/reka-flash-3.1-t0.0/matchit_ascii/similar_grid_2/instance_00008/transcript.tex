The first four rows each have four X's, but the first cell in each of those rows is a ▢. The fifth row is all ▢s.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, let me check again. The user's grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ X X X X  \\ \tt ▢ X X X X  \\ \tt ▢ X X X X  \\ \tt ▢ X X X X  \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢  \\ \tt \\ \tt So each of the first four rows starts with a ▢ followed by four X's. The fifth row is five ▢s. So the grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. The first four rows have a pattern of ▢ followed by four X's. The fifth row is all empty squares.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, the user is asking me to describe my grid. Wait, no. Wait, the user says: "This is your grid:" and then shows that grid. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me read the original problem again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user says: "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game. The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same. Please describe your grid first.
