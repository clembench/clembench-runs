The goal is to describe it in a way that someone else can compare with their own grid.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the grid. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right:\n\nRow 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: ▢ X ▢ X ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nLooking at this, the Xs form a sort of diagonal pattern. The first and last rows have Xs at the corners. The second row has Xs in the second and fourth positions. Then rows 3, 4, and 5 each have an X in the third position. Wait, rows 3, 4, and 5 all have X in the middle? Let me check again.\n\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ → middle is X\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ → same\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ → same\n\nSo rows 3,4,5 each have an X in the third",
