Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X X X X\nX X ▢ X X\nX X ▢ X X",

The first two and last two positions in each row are X's, and the third position is a ▢. Wait, let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: Positions 1,2,4,5 are X, position 3 is ▢. Wait, no, the first row is written as X X ▢ X X. So positions 1: X, 2: X, 3: ▢, 4: X, 5: X. Similarly for row 2. Row 3 is all X's. Then rows 4 and 5 are the same as rows 1 and 2.\n\nSo the pattern is that in rows 1, 2, 4, 5, the third column is a ▢, and the rest are X's. Row 3 is all X's. So the grid has a vertical line of ▢ in the third column for the first two and last two rows, and the middle row",
