The user provided a grid with five rows. The first row is all X's: X X X X X. Then the next four rows have three X's in the middle and the rest are ▢. Let me count each row.\n\nFirst row: five X's. Second row: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are ▢, and position 3 is X. Wait, no. Wait, the second row is written as \"▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\". So that's five elements. So positions 1 and 2 are ▢, position 3 is X, positions 4 and 5 are ▢. Same for the third, fourth, and fifth rows. So each of those rows has an X in the third position and ▢ elsewhere.\n\nSo the grid is 5x5. The first row is all X's. Rows 2-5 have X in the center (third column) and ▢ elsewhere. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\n\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n\nSo the description should mention the size (5x5",
