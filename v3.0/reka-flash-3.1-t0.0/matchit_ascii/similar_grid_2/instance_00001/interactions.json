Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe first line is \"X X X X X\" which I assume are five X's in a row. Then the next lines are \"X ▢ X ▢ X\", repeating that for the third and fourth lines. The last line is again five X's. So the pattern seems to be a border of X's around the edges, and inside, there's a checkerboard pattern of X's and ▢s. Wait, let me check again.\n\nFirst row: all X's. Second row: X, then ▢, X, ▢, X. Third row same as second. Fourth row same. Fifth row all X's. So the outermost layer is solid X's, and the inner 3x3 area (rows 2-4 and columns 2-4) alternates between X and ▢ in a checkerboard. Wait, but in the given grid, the inner part is two X's and two ▢s alternately. Let me count:\n\nRow 2: X ▢ X ▢ X. So positions 1,3,5 are X and 2,4 are ▢. Similarly for row 3 and 4.
