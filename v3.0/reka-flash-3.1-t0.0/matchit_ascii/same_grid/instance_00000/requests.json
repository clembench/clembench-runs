The user provided a grid that looks like a 5x5 grid with some Xs and ▢s. Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe first row is all Xs: X X X X X. Then the second row starts with an X followed by four ▢s. The third row has three Xs and two ▢s. The fourth row is similar to the second, X followed by four ▢s. The fifth row is all Xs again. \n\nHmm, so the pattern seems to be that the outer rows (first and fifth) are completely filled with Xs. The second and fourth rows start and end with Xs but have ▢s in between. The third row has three Xs in the middle and two ▢s on the ends. Wait, let me check again. Third row: X X X ▢ ▢. So positions 1-3 are X, 4-5 are ▢. Similarly, second and fourth rows: X followed by four ▢s. Wait, no, second row is X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢. So position 1 is X, 2-5 are ▢. Same for the fourth row. \n\nSo the grid is symmetric vertically and horizontally? Let me see. The first and fifth rows are the same. Second and fourth rows are the same. Third row is in",
