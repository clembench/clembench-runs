Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\n▢ X ▢ X ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X",

Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: ▢ X ▢ X ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ X ▢ X ▢\nRow 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n\nHmm, this looks like a cross shape with a smaller cross in the center. The outer ring is all X's, and the inner part has a cross as well. Let me check each row and column to confirm symmetry. \n\nLooking at rows:\n- Row 1 and Row 5 are the same, just mirrored.\n- Row 2 and Row 4 are the same, mirrored.\n- Row 3 is the middle row, symmetric.\n\nColumns should mirror too. Let's check column 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X. Column 5 is the same. Column 2: ▢, X, ▢, X, ▢. Column 4 is the same. Column 3 is ▢, ▢, X, ▢, ▢, which is symmetric. So the grid is symmetric both horizontally and vertically.\n\nAnother way to describe it: a 5x",
