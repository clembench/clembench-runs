The first four rows are all filled with X's, and the fifth row has some ▢ symbols. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's input:\n\nX X X X X  \nX X X X X  \n▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢  \nX X X X X  \nX X X X X  \n\nSo, rows 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all X's. The third row has two ▢, then an X, then two more ▢. Wait, let me count the columns. Each row has five elements. So row 3 is positions 1: ▢, 2: ▢, 3: X, 4: ▢, 5: ▢. So the third row has X in the middle and ▢s on the sides.\n\nSo the description needs to clearly state that the first, second, fourth, and fifth rows are all X's, and the third row has ▢ in positions 1,2,4,5 and X in position 3. Alternatively, maybe using a more concise way. Maybe mention the positions of the ▢s. Alternatively, describe the grid structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants a textual representation. But the instruction says to describe the grid, not to reproduce it. So perhaps a verbal description.",
