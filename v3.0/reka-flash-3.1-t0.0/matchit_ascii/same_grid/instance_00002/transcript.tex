	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a grid with X's and ▢ symbols. Let me look at it again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 2: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 3: X X X X X\\ \tt Row 4: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 5: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, so each row has five elements. The first two and last two positions in each row are X's, and the third position is a ▢. Wait, let me check each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: Positions 1,2,4,5 are X, position 3 is ▢. Wait, no, the first row is written as X X ▢ X X. So positions 1: X, 2: X, 3: ▢, 4: X, 5: X. Similarly for row 2. Row 3 is all X's. Then rows 4 and 5 are the same as rows 1 and 2.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the pattern is that in rows 1, 2, 4, 5, the third column is a ▢, and the rest are X's. Row 3 is all X's. So the grid has a vertical line of ▢ in the third column for the first two and last two rows, and the middle row
