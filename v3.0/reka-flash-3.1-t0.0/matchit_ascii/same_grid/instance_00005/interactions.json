My task is to describe it in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly. I'll start by looking at each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: ▢ X X X ▢. So the first and fifth positions are empty, and the middle three are X's. That's straightforward.\n\nSecond row: ▢ ▢ X X ▢. Here, the first two and last positions are empty, and the third and fourth are X's.\n\nThird row: ▢ X ▢ X ▢. The pattern here is empty, X, empty, X, empty. So alternating X's starting from the second position.\n\nFourth row: ▢ X X ▢ ▢. First position is empty, second and third are X's, then two empty at the end.\n\nFifth row: ▢ X X X ▢. Similar to the first row but shifted. First and last empty, middle three X's.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't mix up any positions. Let's index them from 1 to 5 for each row.\n\nRow 1: Positions 1: ▢, 2: X, 3: X, 4: X, 5: ▢. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 1",
