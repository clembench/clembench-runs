	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X

The grid they provided is a 5x5 grid where the first four rows have an X followed by four empty squares (▢), and the fifth row is all Xs.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user says "This is your grid," but then they show a grid. Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the original message again. Oh, right, the user is participating in a collaborative guessing game. They provided a grid, and I need to describe it. Wait, no, the user says "This is your grid," but then they show a grid. Wait, maybe the user is the one providing their grid, and I need to describe it? Or is the user asking me to describe my own grid? Let me read the instructions again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user says: "Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description..." So the user is telling me to describe my grid. But then they show a grid: "This is your grid: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X X X X X". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the grid they provided:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X ▢ ▢
