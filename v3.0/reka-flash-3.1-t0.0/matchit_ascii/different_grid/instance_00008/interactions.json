Now start your short grid description with \"DESCRIPTION:\" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX X ▢ X X\nX ▢ X ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X",

Let me count the rows and columns. Each row seems to have five elements. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 2: X X ▢ X X\nRow 3: X ▢ X ▢ X\nRow 4: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\nRow 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\n\nSo it's a 5x5 grid. The first and fifth rows are the same: X in the first and last positions, and ▢ in the middle three. The second row starts and ends with X, has X in the second position, then ▢, then X. Wait, no, let me check again. Row 2: X X ▢ X X. So positions 1 and 2 are X, position 3 is ▢, positions 4 and 5 are X. Then row 3: X ▢ X ▢ X. So positions 1 and 5 are X, position 3 is X, others are ▢. Rows 4 and 5 are the same as row 1: X in first and last, ▢ in the middle three.\n\nHmm. So the pattern seems to have a border of X's around",
