	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X\\ \tt ▢ X X X X

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a grid with five rows and five columns. Each cell is either a blank (▢) or an X. My task is to describe this grid in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at each row and note the positions of the Xs. Let's go row by row.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: All five cells are blank. So, "▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢".\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: The second row starts with a blank, followed by four Xs. So, "▢ X X X X".\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3: The third row has three blanks and then two Xs. Wait, let me check again. The third row is "▢ ▢ ▢ X X". So positions 4 and 5 are Xs.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 4: All four Xs starting from the second position? Wait, the fourth row is "▢ X X X X". So first cell is blank, then four Xs. Wait, but there are five cells. Let me count: ▢ (1), X (2), X (3), X (4), X (5). So yes, first is blank, then four Xs.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 5: Similarly, "▢ X X X X". Same as row 4? Wait, the user's grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row
