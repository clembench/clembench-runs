My task is to describe this grid in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row and note the positions of the Xs. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 1: All five cells are blank. So, \"▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\".\n\nRow 2: The second row starts with a blank, followed by four Xs. So, \"▢ X X X X\".\n\nRow 3: The third row has three blanks and then two Xs. Wait, let me check again. The third row is \"▢ ▢ ▢ X X\". So positions 4 and 5 are Xs.\n\nRow 4: All four Xs starting from the second position? Wait, the fourth row is \"▢ X X X X\". So first cell is blank, then four Xs. Wait, but there are five cells. Let me count: ▢ (1), X (2), X (3), X (4), X (5). So yes, first is blank, then four Xs.\n\nRow 5: Similarly, \"▢ X X X X\". Same as row 4? Wait, the user's grid is:\n\nRow",
