Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe grid is 5x5, right? Let's break it down row by row. The first row starts with an X, then three ▢, and ends with another X. The second row is the same: X followed by three ▢ and X. The third row is all Xs: X X X X X. Then the fourth and fifth rows mirror the first two, with X, three ▢, X again.\n\nSo, the pattern is a horizontal bar in the middle row (third row) that's completely filled with Xs, and the rows above and below have Xs at the ends with ▢ in the middle three positions. That makes a cross shape where the vertical part is the middle column? Wait, no. Wait, the middle row is all Xs, so that's a horizontal line. The rows above and below have Xs on the ends, so that's vertical lines. So combining them, it's a plus sign (+) made of Xs, with the middle row being the horizontal line and the middle column being the vertical line. But in this case, the vertical lines are only in the first and fifth columns of the top and bottom rows. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the first row is X ▢ ▢ ▢",
