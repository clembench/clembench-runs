The user provided a grid with X's and ▢'s. Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe grid has 5 rows. Let's break it down row by row:\n\n1st row: X X X X X – all X's.\n2nd row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X – four ▢'s and one X at the end.\n3rd row: ▢ ▢ X X X – two ▢'s followed by three X's.\n4th row: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X – similar to the second row, four ▢'s and one X.\n5th row: X X X X X – same as the first row, all X's.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first and fifth rows are all X's. The second and fourth rows have four ▢'s and one X each, but in different positions. The third row has two ▢'s and three X's. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the second row is ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X – so the X is at the end. The fourth row is ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X – same as the second? Or maybe the X is at the beginning? Wait, the user wrote:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X for the second row. So positions 1",
