Let me visualize it first.\n\nThe first row is ▢ followed by four X's. So, position (1,1) is the circle, and the rest are X's. The second row starts with an X, then a ▢, and three X's. So (2,2) is the circle. Third row: X, X, ▢, X, X. That's (3,3). Fourth row: X, X, X, ▢, X. So (4,4). Fifth row: all X's except the last one, which is ▢. Wait, no, the fifth row is X X X X ▢. So (5,5) is the circle. \n\nWait, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\n▢ X X X X  \nX ▢ X X X  \nX X ▢ X X  \nX X X ▢ X  \nX X X X ▢  \n\nYes, each row has a circle in the diagonal positions. So it's a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. Each row i has the circle in column i. So row 1, column 1; row 2, column 2; etc. So the grid is a 5x5 diagonal matrix with circles and",
