The goal is to compare it with another grid they have, but I can't see it. So I need to describe my grid in a way that's clear enough for them to check for differences.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure. The grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. The first row starts and ends with X, and the middle three are ▢. The second row starts with X, then three ▢, and ends with two X's. Wait, no, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X  \nX ▢ ▢ X X  \nX ▢ X ▢ X  \nX X ▢ ▢ X  \nX ▢ ▢ ▢ X  \n\nSo each line is a row. Let me parse each row:\n\nRow 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X  \nRow 2: X, ▢, ▢, X, X  \nRow 3: X, ▢, X, ▢, X  \nRow 4: X, X, ▢, ▢, X  \nRow 5: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X  \n\nHmm, interesting. So the first and fifth rows are the same: X in the corners and",
