	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a 5x5 grid with X's and ▢'s. The goal is to compare it with another grid they have, but I can't see it. So I need to describe my grid in a way that's clear enough for them to check for differences.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I'll look at the structure. The grid is 5 rows by 5 columns. The first row starts and ends with X, and the middle three are ▢. The second row starts with X, then three ▢, and ends with two X's. Wait, no, let me check again. The user wrote:\\ \tt \\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X  \\ \tt X ▢ ▢ X X  \\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X  \\ \tt X X ▢ ▢ X  \\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X  \\ \tt \\ \tt So each line is a row. Let me parse each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X  \\ \tt Row 2: X, ▢, ▢, X, X  \\ \tt Row 3: X, ▢, X, ▢, X  \\ \tt Row 4: X, X, ▢, ▢, X  \\ \tt Row 5: X, ▢, ▢, ▢, X  \\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, interesting. So the first and fifth rows are the same: X in the corners and
