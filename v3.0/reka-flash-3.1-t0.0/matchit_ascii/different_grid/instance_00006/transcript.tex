	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt X X ▢ X X\\ \tt X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X X X ▢

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a 5x5 grid with some Xs and empty squares. The task is to describe it in a way that someone else can compare with their own grid. Let me look at the structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the grid is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt Row 2: X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt Row 3: X X ▢ X X\\ \tt Row 4: X ▢ X ▢ X\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ X X X ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, so each row alternates between starting and ending with empty squares. Let me check each row:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1 starts and ends with empty, then has three Xs in the middle. So positions 1 and 5 are empty, 2-4 are X.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2 starts with X, then empty, X, empty, X. So positions 1,3,5 are X, 2 and 4 are empty.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3 is similar to row 1 but shifted? Wait, row 3 is X X ▢ X X. So positions 1,2,4,5 are X, and position 3 is empty. Wait, no: X X ▢ X X would be positions 1: X, 2: X, 3: empty, 4: X, 5: X. So
