The user provided a 5x5 grid with some Xs and empty squares. The task is to describe it in a way that someone else can compare with their own grid. Let me look at the structure.\n\nFirst, the grid is:\n\nRow 1: ▢ X X X ▢\nRow 2: X ▢ X ▢ X\nRow 3: X X ▢ X X\nRow 4: X ▢ X ▢ X\nRow 5: ▢ X X X ▢\n\nHmm, so each row alternates between starting and ending with empty squares. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1 starts and ends with empty, then has three Xs in the middle. So positions 1 and 5 are empty, 2-4 are X.\n\nRow 2 starts with X, then empty, X, empty, X. So positions 1,3,5 are X, 2 and 4 are empty.\n\nRow 3 is similar to row 1 but shifted? Wait, row 3 is X X ▢ X X. So positions 1,2,4,5 are X, and position 3 is empty. Wait, no: X X ▢ X X would be positions 1: X, 2: X, 3: empty, 4: X, 5: X. So",
