	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else. This is your grid:\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt X ▢ ▢ ▢ X

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let me try to figure out how to describe this grid properly. The user provided a 5x5 grid with X's and ▢'s. The goal is to describe it in a way that someone else can visualize it correctly. Let me look at the grid again:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ X X X\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ X ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt Row 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ X\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, so each row starts and ends with X, and the middle three positions vary. Let me check each row step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: The first and fifth elements are X, the rest are ▢. So positions 1 and 5 are X, others are ▢.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 2: Second and fifth are X, others ▢. Wait, no. Let's count: Row 2 is ▢ X ▢ ▢ X. So positions 2 and 5 are X, others ▢.\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ X X X. So positions 3,4,5 are X? Wait, no. Let's see: the third row is ▢ ▢ X X X. So positions 3,4,5 are X? Wait, no. Wait, the third row is ▢ (
