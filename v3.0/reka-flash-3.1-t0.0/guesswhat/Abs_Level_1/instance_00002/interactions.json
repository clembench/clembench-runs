The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['son', 'stepbrother', 'fever', 'sty', 'windsurfing', 'paragliding', 'optician', 'neurosurgeon']",

The list is: son, stepbrother, fever, sty, windsurfing, paragliding, optician, neurosurgeon.\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or groupings. Let's see. The words can be divided into different types. For example, some are family relations, others are medical terms, some are sports or activities, and others are professions or body parts.\n\nLooking at the list: son and stepbrother are family members. Fever and sty are medical terms (fever is a symptom, sty is a small sore on the eyelid). Windsurfing and paragliding are sports or activities. Optician and neurosurgeon are professions (optician is someone who makes or fits glasses, neurosurgeon is a type of surgeon specializing in the nervous system).\n\nSo maybe the target is in one of these categories. Let's see how many words are in each category. Family: 2, medical: 2, sports: 2, professions: 2. So four categories, each with two words. If I can narrow it down to a category first, then maybe ask about specifics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the target is a noun, which all of them are. Not helpful. Let's think of other characteristics. Let's see:\n\n- Son: male child, family",
