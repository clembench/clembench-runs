Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['postman', 'actor', 'flatmate', 'bos', 'dietician', 'nurse', 'name', 'infinitive'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is: postman, actor, flatmate, bos, dietician, nurse, name, infinitive.\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- postman: a job title, male, delivers mail.\n- actor: profession, entertains.\n- flatmate: someone who lives with you, not a job.\n- bos: abbreviation, maybe \"boss\" or \"best of something\"? But in the list, it's probably \"boss\" short for boss.\n- dietician: profession related to diet.\n- nurse: healthcare profession.\n- name: a word for a person's identity.\n- infinitive: a grammatical form in verbs.\n\nHmm. The challenge is that some are professions (postman, actor, dietician, nurse, bos?), others are relationships (flatmate), and some are abstract (name, infinitive). Maybe I can categorize them.\n\nFirst question: Is the target word a profession? Let's see. If yes, then possible words are postman, actor, dietician, nurse, bos. If no, then flatmate, name, infinitive. Let's check if \"bos\" is a profession. \"Bos\" is short for boss, which is a job. So if the answer is yes",
