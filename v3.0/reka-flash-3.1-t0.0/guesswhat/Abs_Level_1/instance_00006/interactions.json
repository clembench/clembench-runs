The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['birthday', 'marriage', 'laud', 'afternoon', 'optometrist', 'podiatry', 'spot', 'sweating']",

The list is: birthday, marriage, laud, afternoon, optometrist, podiatry, spot, sweating.\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. The words are a mix of nouns. Some are events (birthday, marriage), some are times (afternoon), others are professions (optometrist, podiatry), and some are nouns like spot, laud, sweating.\n\nMaybe start by categorizing them. Let's see:\n\n- Events: birthday, marriage\n- Time: afternoon\n- Professions: optometrist, podiatry\n- Objects/Actions: laud, spot, sweating\n\nHmm. Maybe ask if the word is a type of event. So first question: \"Is the target word a type of event?\" If yes, then birthday or marriage. If no, then the others.\n\nWait, but the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. But I can ask about categories. So maybe that's allowed.\n\nSo first question: \"Is the target word a type of event?\" Possible answers: yes (birthday, marriage) or no (the rest). Let's see. If yes, then next question could be between those two. If",
