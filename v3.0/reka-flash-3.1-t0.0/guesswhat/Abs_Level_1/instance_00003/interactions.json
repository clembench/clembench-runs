The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['lunchtime', 'evening', 'fainting', 'swelling', 'paganism', 'wiccan', 'knight', 'sir']",

The list is ['lunchtime', 'evening', 'fainting','swelling', 'paganism', 'wiccan', 'knight','sir'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. The words are all nouns except maybe some verbs. Let's check each word:\n\n- lunchtime: noun, time of lunch\n- evening: noun, part of the day\n- fainting: noun, the act of fainting (could be a gerund)\n- swelling: noun, the act of swelling\n- paganism: noun, religion\n- wiccan: noun, someone who practices Wicca (gerund or adjective)\n- knight: noun, historical warrior\n- sir: noun, title for a man\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nTime-related: lunchtime, evening\nHealth-related: fainting, swelling\nReligion: paganism, wiccan\nTitles/roles: knight, sir\n\nSo maybe first question: Is the target related to time? That could split into lunchtime/evening vs others. Let's try that.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target related to a part of the day? Possible answers: lunchtime, evening. If yes, then next question could be between those",
