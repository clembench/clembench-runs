Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['schizophrenia','sociopath', 'acquaintance', 'employee', 'parsec', 'pitch', 'lying', 'annoying'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The rules say I can't ask about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does it start with a vowel?\" or \"How many letters does it have?\" That complicates things a bit because usually, those are the first questions in a guessing game.\n\nFirst, I should look at the list of words: ['schizophrenia','sociopath', 'acquaintance', 'employee', 'parsec', 'pitch', 'lying', 'annoying']. Let me categorize them to see if there's a common theme or something else I can use. \n\nLooking at the words, some are medical terms (schizophrenia, sociopath), some are nouns (acquaintance, employee, parsec, pitch, lying, annoying). Wait, \"lying\" and \"annoying\" are verbs and adjectives, respectively. The others are nouns. Maybe I can start by asking if the target is a noun. That might split the list into two groups. Let's check: \n\nMedical terms: schizophrenia (noun), sociopath (noun). \nOther nouns: acquaintance, employee, parsec, pitch. \nVerbs/adjectives: lying, annoying. \n\nSo if I ask \"Is the target a noun?\" the answer could help narrow",
