I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['wet', 'dry', 'lady', 'duke', 'anniversary', 'prom', 'democrat', 'idealism'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or themes. Let's see. The words are: two adjectives (wet, dry), two titles (lady, duke), two events (anniversary, prom), and two political terms (democrat, idealism). Wait, idealism is a noun, not a political term. Maybe I need to re-categorize. Let's list them again:\n\n- wet, dry: adjectives describing state of being.\n- lady, duke: titles or ranks (female and male nobility or titles).\n- anniversary, prom: events or occasions.\n- democrat: political party (US), idealism: a philosophical concept.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can start by asking if the word is a noun. Let's see. If the answer is yes, then we can eliminate adjectives. Let's check: wet and dry are adjectives, so if the target is a noun, then the possible words are lady, duke, anniversary, prom, democrat, idealism. That's six words. If the answer is no, then the target is wet or dry. But that's only two options. Wait, but maybe the",
