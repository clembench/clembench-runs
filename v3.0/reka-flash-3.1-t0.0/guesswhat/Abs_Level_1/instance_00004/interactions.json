The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list is ['wet', 'dry', 'lady', 'duke', 'anniversary', 'prom', 'democrat', 'idealism'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or themes. Let's see. The words are: two adjectives (wet, dry), two titles (lady, duke), two events (anniversary, prom), and two political terms (democrat, idealism). Wait, idealism is a noun, not a political term. Maybe I need to re-categorize. Let's list them again:\n\n- wet, dry: adjectives describing state of being.\n- lady, duke: titles or ranks (female and male nobility or titles).\n- anniversary, prom: events or occasions.\n- democrat: political party (US), idealism: a philosophical concept.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can start by asking if the word is a noun. Let's see. If the answer is yes, then we can eliminate adjectives. Let's check: wet and dry are adjectives, so if the target is a noun, then the possible words are lady, duke, anniversary, prom, democrat, idealism. That's six words. If the answer is no, then the target is wet or dry. But that's only two options. Wait, but maybe the",
