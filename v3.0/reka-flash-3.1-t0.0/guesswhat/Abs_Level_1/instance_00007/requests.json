Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['outlier', 'datum', 'psychotic', 'greed', 'league', 'knot', 'one', 'twenty-nine'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['outlier', 'datum', 'psychotic', 'greed', 'league', 'knot', 'one', 'twenty-nine'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- outlier: a person or thing that is very different from others in a group\n- datum: a single fact or item of information\n- psychotic: relating to psychosis, a mental disorder\n- greed: excessive desire for more of something, especially material possessions\n- league: a group of sports teams that compete against each other\n- knot: a type of knot, or a node in a rope\n- one: the number 1\n- twenty-nine: the number 29\n\nHmm. These are all nouns except maybe 'one' and 'twenty-nine' which are numbers. Wait, 'one' is a number, 'twenty-nine' is a number. The rest are nouns. So maybe that's not helpful. Let's think of other categories.\n\nLooking at the words, some are abstract concepts (outlier, datum, psychotic, greed, league, knot) and some are numbers (one, twenty-nine). Maybe I can split them into abstract vs. concrete. Wait, but 'league' and 'knot' are more concrete. 'Datum' is abstract",
