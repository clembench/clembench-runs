	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['outlier', 'datum', 'psychotic', 'greed', 'league', 'knot', 'one', 'twenty-nine']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['outlier', 'datum', 'psychotic', 'greed', 'league', 'knot', 'one', 'twenty-nine'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\\ \tt \\ \tt - outlier: a person or thing that is very different from others in a group\\ \tt - datum: a single fact or item of information\\ \tt - psychotic: relating to psychosis, a mental disorder\\ \tt - greed: excessive desire for more of something, especially material possessions\\ \tt - league: a group of sports teams that compete against each other\\ \tt - knot: a type of knot, or a node in a rope\\ \tt - one: the number 1\\ \tt - twenty-nine: the number 29\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. These are all nouns except maybe 'one' and 'twenty-nine' which are numbers. Wait, 'one' is a number, 'twenty-nine' is a number. The rest are nouns. So maybe that's not helpful. Let's think of other categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the words, some are abstract concepts (outlier, datum, psychotic, greed, league, knot) and some are numbers (one, twenty-nine). Maybe I can split them into abstract vs. concrete. Wait, but 'league' and 'knot' are more concrete. 'Datum' is abstract
