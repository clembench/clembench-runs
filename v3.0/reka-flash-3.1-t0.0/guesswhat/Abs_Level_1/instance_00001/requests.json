Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['polygon', 'crescent', 'lawyer','magistrate', 'bowl', 'tube','relay','soccer'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['polygon', 'crescent', 'lawyer','magistrate', 'bowl', 'tube','relay','soccer'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. The words are a mix of nouns. Some are objects (bowl, tube), some are professions (lawyer, magistrate), some are shapes (polygon, crescent), and others are activities or sports (relay, soccer). Maybe I can start by categorizing them.\n\nLet me think of a question that splits the list into two groups. For example, is the word a type of shape? Polygon and crescent are shapes. So if the answer is yes, the target is either polygon or crescent. If no, then it's one of the others. Let's try that.\n\nWait, but the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask if it's a shape. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe I can't ask about the definition or category of the word. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, the user said the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics",
