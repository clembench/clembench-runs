I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['enemy', 'fiance', 'pleasure', 'cheering','reference','reality', 'percent','seventh'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- enemy: a person who is your opponent or adversary.\n- fiance: a person you're engaged to marry.\n- pleasure: enjoyment or delight.\n- cheering: expressing enthusiasm or encouragement.\n- reference: a mention of something in a text; a citation.\n- reality: the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or be imagined.\n- percent: a hundredth part; a percentage.\n- seventh: ordinal number for 7.\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nNouns: enemy, fiance, pleasure, reference, reality, percent, seventh. Wait, 'cheering' is a verb in the base form, but here it's a noun? Or maybe a gerund. Not sure. But maybe that's a stretch. Let's check each word's part of speech.\n\nEnemy - noun.\nFiancé - noun.\nPleasure - noun.\nCheering - noun (gerund) or verb.\nReference - noun.\nReality - noun.\nPercent - noun.\nSeventh - adjective or noun (as in the seventh",
