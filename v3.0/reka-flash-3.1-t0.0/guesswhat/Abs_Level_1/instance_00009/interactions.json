The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['enemy', 'fiance', 'pleasure', 'cheering', 'reference', 'reality', 'percent', 'seventh']",

The list is ['enemy', 'fiance', 'pleasure', 'cheering','reference','reality', 'percent','seventh'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- enemy: a person who is your opponent or adversary.\n- fiance: a person you're engaged to marry.\n- pleasure: enjoyment or delight.\n- cheering: expressing enthusiasm or encouragement.\n- reference: a mention of something in a text; a citation.\n- reality: the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or be imagined.\n- percent: a hundredth part; a percentage.\n- seventh: ordinal number for 7.\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nNouns: enemy, fiance, pleasure, reference, reality, percent, seventh. Wait, 'cheering' is a verb in the base form, but here it's a noun? Or maybe a gerund. Not sure. But maybe that's a stretch. Let's check each word's part of speech.\n\nEnemy - noun.\nFiancé - noun.\nPleasure - noun.\nCheering - noun (gerund) or verb.\nReference - noun.\nReality - noun.\nPercent - noun.\nSeventh - adjective or noun (as in the seventh",
