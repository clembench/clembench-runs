Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['baker', 'butcher', 'accountant', 'businessman','musician', 'dancer', 'hairdresser', 'plumber'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['baker', 'butcher', 'accountant', 'businessman','musician', 'dancer', 'hairdresser', 'plumber'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. They are all professions. Maybe I can categorize them. Let's see:\n\n- Baker, butcher, hairdresser, plumber: these are trades or manual jobs, maybe considered more \"blue-collar\"?\n- Accountant, businessman: more business-related, maybe \"white-collar\".\n- Musician, dancer: creative or artistic professions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split based on gender? But the list has 'businessman' which is male, others are gender-neutral. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nAnother angle: think about the tools or items associated with each. But the rules say questions can't relate to structure, spelling, or characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about tools. Hmm.\n\nWait, the questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, but maybe about the profession's attributes. For example, \"Does the target job involve working with animals?\" But I need to make sure it's a yes/no question that's answerable without knowing the word's specifics. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific",
