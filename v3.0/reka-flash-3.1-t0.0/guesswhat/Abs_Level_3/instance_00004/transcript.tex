	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['baker', 'butcher', 'accountant', 'businessman', 'musician', 'dancer', 'hairdresser', 'plumber']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['baker', 'butcher', 'accountant', 'businessman','musician', 'dancer', 'hairdresser', 'plumber'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common characteristics among these words. They are all professions. Maybe I can categorize them. Let's see:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Baker, butcher, hairdresser, plumber: these are trades or manual jobs, maybe considered more "blue-collar"?\\ \tt - Accountant, businessman: more business-related, maybe "white-collar".\\ \tt - Musician, dancer: creative or artistic professions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe split based on gender? But the list has 'businessman' which is male, others are gender-neutral. Not sure if that's useful.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: think about the tools or items associated with each. But the rules say questions can't relate to structure, spelling, or characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about tools. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the questions can't be about the word's structure or spelling, but maybe about the profession's attributes. For example, "Does the target job involve working with animals?" But I need to make sure it's a yes/no question that's answerable without knowing the word's specifics. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific
