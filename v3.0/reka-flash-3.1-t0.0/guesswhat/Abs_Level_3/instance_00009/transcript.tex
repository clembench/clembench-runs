	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['cholera', 'herpes', 'smallpox', 'chickenpox', 'chlamydia', 'gonorrhoea', 'depression', 'anxiety']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The words are all medical terms except maybe 'depression' and 'anxiety', which are mental health conditions. The others are infections: cholera, herpes, smallpox, chickenpox, chlamydia, gonorrhoea. So maybe the first question should determine if it's a mental health term or an infectious disease.\\ \tt \\ \tt So question 1: Is the target word related to mental health? That would split the list into two groups. If yes, then the answer is either depression or anxiety. If no, then it's one of the infectious diseases. Let's go with that.\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then next question could be: Is the target word "depression"? If yes, then guess depression. If no, then anxiety. But maybe that's too straightforward. Alternatively, if the first question is about mental health, then proceed accordingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is no, then the target is one of the infectious diseases. Then next question: Does the target word start with 'ch'? Let's see: cholera, chickenpox, chlamydia. So if yes, then those three. If no, then herpes, smallpox, gonorrhoea. That narrows it down.\\ \tt \\ \tt Suppose the first answer is no (infectious disease). Then question 2:
