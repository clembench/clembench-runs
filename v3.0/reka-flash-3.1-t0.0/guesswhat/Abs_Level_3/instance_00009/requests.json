I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The words are all medical terms except maybe 'depression' and 'anxiety', which are mental health conditions. The others are infections: cholera, herpes, smallpox, chickenpox, chlamydia, gonorrhoea. So maybe the first question should determine if it's a mental health term or an infectious disease.\n\nSo question 1: Is the target word related to mental health? That would split the list into two groups. If yes, then the answer is either depression or anxiety. If no, then it's one of the infectious diseases. Let's go with that.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then next question could be: Is the target word \"depression\"? If yes, then guess depression. If no, then anxiety. But maybe that's too straightforward. Alternatively, if the first question is about mental health, then proceed accordingly.\n\nIf the answer is no, then the target is one of the infectious diseases. Then next question: Does the target word start with 'ch'? Let's see: cholera, chickenpox, chlamydia. So if yes, then those three. If no, then herpes, smallpox, gonorrhoea. That narrows it down.\n\nSuppose the first answer is no (infectious disease). Then question 2:",
