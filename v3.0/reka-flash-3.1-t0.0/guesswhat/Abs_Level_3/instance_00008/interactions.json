The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['sledding', 'cycling', 'football', 'boxing', 'swimming', 'surfing', 'canoeing', 'kayaking']",

The list is ['sledding', 'cycling', 'football', 'boxing','swimming','surfing', 'canoeing', 'kayaking'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. All of them are activities or sports, I think. Let me check: sledding is a winter sport, cycling is a vehicle or exercise, football is a team sport, boxing is combat, swimming is water-based, surfing is water, canoeing and kayaking are both paddling watercraft. So maybe categorizing them by type could help.\n\nMaybe start by splitting them into land vs water activities. Let's see: sledding (land), cycling (land), football (land), boxing (land), swimming (water), surfing (water), canoeing (water), kayaking (water). So that's 5 land and 3 water. If I ask if the target is a water activity, that could narrow it down. Let's try that.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target a water-based activity? If yes, then the options are swimming, surfing, canoeing, kayaking. If no, then sledding, cycling, football, boxing. Let's see which group is smaller. The water group is 4, land is 4. Hmm,",
