All these are religions or religious groups, except maybe 'protestant' and 'quaker'? Wait, Protestant is a branch of Christianity, and Quakers are a religious group within Christianity. So all of them are religions or denominations. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The user said questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. The answers are yes or no.

So maybe something like \"Is the target word associated with a founder who lived in the 19th century?\" But wait, the question can't be about the word's characteristics.
