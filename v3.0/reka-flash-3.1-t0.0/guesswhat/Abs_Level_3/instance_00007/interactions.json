The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list is ['hinduism','scientology', 'taoism', 'jainism', 'christianity','sikhism', 'protestant', 'quaker'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories. All these are religions or religious groups, except maybe 'protestant' and 'quaker'? Wait, Protestant is a branch of Christianity, and Quakers are a religious group within Christianity. So all of them are religions or denominations. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The user said questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. The answers are yes or no. So I need to ask questions that can help narrow down the list based on some other criteria.\n\nPossible angles: origin, founder, time period, associated practices, regions where they're practiced, number of followers, etc. But the question can't be about the word's structure. So maybe something like \"Is the target word associated with a founder who lived in the 19th century?\" But wait, the question can't be about the word's characteristics. Wait, the rules say the questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself. So the question has to be about the concept,",
