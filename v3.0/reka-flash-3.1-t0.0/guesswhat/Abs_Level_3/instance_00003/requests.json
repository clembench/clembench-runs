I need to figure out which word from the list is the target. The list is ['oblong','semicircle', 'nonagon', 'heptagon', 'trapezium', 'parallelogram', 'dodecahedron', 'decahedron']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does it have 5 letters?\" or \"Is it a polygon?\" Wait, maybe I can? Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 2 says the questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself. So asking about letters, syllables, spelling, or specific features of the word (like \"Is it a noun?\") is not allowed. But maybe questions about the meaning or category of the word are okay. For example, \"Is the target word a three-dimensional shape?\" That's about the meaning, not the word's structure. So I can categorize the words.\n\nLooking at the list, let's categorize them. Let's see:\n\n- Oblong: a type of quadrilateral, shape, but not a regular polygon. It's a rectangle that's not a square, maybe? Or a rhombus? Wait, actually",
