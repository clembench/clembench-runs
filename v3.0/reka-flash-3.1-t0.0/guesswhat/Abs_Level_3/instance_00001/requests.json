Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['gunner', 'officer', 'corporal','sergeant', 'captain','major', 'general', 'brigadier'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target. The list is ['gunner', 'officer', 'corporal','sergeant', 'captain','major', 'general', 'brigadier']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, or parts of the word. They have to be about the meaning or context.\n\nFirst, I should probably categorize these words. Let's see. All of them are military ranks, right? Let me confirm. Gunner is a military role, officer is a general term, corporal, sergeant, captain, major, general, brigadier—all are military ranks. So the target is one of these. That's good to know. So maybe I can start by narrowing down based on the hierarchy or branch of service.\n\nWait, but the questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So I can't ask if it's a noun or starts with a certain letter. So I need to think of questions that relate to their roles or hierarchy. For example, \"Is the target word a higher rank than a sergeant?\" But wait, the rules say the answer has to be yes or no. So maybe that's allowed. Let me",
