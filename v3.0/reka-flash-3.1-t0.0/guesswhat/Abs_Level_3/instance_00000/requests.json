I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['troll','minotaur', 'psychic', 'witch','monster', 'unicorn', 'vampire', 'goblin'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's categorize them. Some are mythical creatures, others are supernatural beings, and maybe some are more like fantasy characters. Let's list them:\n\n- Troll: mythical creature, often depicted as ugly and living in caves.\n- Minotaur: a creature from Greek mythology, a bull-headed man.\n- Psychic: someone with extrasensory perception, not a physical creature.\n- Witch: a female sorceress, uses magic.\n- Monster: a general term for something frightening or terrible, can be any type.\n- Unicorn: a mythical horse with a horn.\n- Vampire: a mythical undead creature that drinks blood.\n- Goblin: a small, mischievous creature, similar to a goblin.\n\nSo, some are specific creatures (troll, minotaur, goblin, vampire, unicorn, minotaur), some are supernatural beings (witch, psychic), and monster is a general term.
