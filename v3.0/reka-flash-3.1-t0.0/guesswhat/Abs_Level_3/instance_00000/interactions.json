The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['troll', 'minotaur', 'psychic', 'witch', 'monster', 'unicorn', 'vampire', 'goblin']",

The list is ['troll','minotaur', 'psychic', 'witch','monster', 'unicorn', 'vampire', 'goblin'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's categorize them. Some are mythical creatures, others are supernatural beings, and maybe some are more like fantasy characters. Let's list them:\n\n- Troll: mythical creature, often depicted as ugly and living in caves.\n- Minotaur: a creature from Greek mythology, a bull-headed man.\n- Psychic: someone with extrasensory perception, not a physical creature.\n- Witch: a female sorceress, uses magic.\n- Monster: a general term for something frightening or terrible, can be any type.\n- Unicorn: a mythical horse with a horn.\n- Vampire: a mythical undead creature that drinks blood.\n- Goblin: a small, mischievous creature, similar to a goblin.\n\nSo, some are specific creatures (troll, minotaur, goblin, vampire, unicorn, minotaur), some are supernatural beings (witch, psychic), and monster is a general term. Wait, but \"monster\" is in the list. So maybe the target is a specific creature rather than a general term? Or maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of these are",
