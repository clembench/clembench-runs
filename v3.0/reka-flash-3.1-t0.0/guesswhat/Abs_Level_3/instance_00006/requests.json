Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['technician', 'optician', 'psychotherapist', 'chiropractor','surgeon', 'gp', 'nurse', 'pharmacist'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is: ['technician', 'optician', 'psychotherapist', 'chiropractor','surgeon', 'gp', 'nurse', 'pharmacist'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. All of them are medical professions, right? Let me check. Technician, optician, psychotherapist, chiropractor, surgeon, gp (general practitioner), nurse, pharmacist. Yep, all medical roles. So maybe the first question can narrow down based on that. But the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling, so I can't ask if it's a 9-letter word or something. So I need to think of other attributes.\n\nSince they're all medical, maybe categorize them. For example, some are primary care providers, others are specialists. GP is a primary care doctor. Surgeon is a specialist. Nurse is a different role. Technician might be more support staff. Optician, pharmacist, chiropractor, psychotherapist—those are various specialties.\n\nAlternatively, think about the type of work. Surgeons operate, nurses provide patient care, pharmacists dispense meds. Opticians deal with glasses, chiropractors with spinal adjustments, psychotherapists with mental health. Technicians might be more technical roles, like lab tech or MRI",
