	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Let’s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['midday', 'sunrise', 'suppertime', 'lunchtime', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'breakfast', 'brunch']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['midday','sunrise','suppertime', 'lunchtime', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'breakfast', 'brunch'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common characteristics among these words. They all seem to be times of day or meals associated with specific times. Wait, some are meals and others are times. Let me separate them. Breakfast, brunch, lunchtime, suppertime—those are meals. Midday, sunrise, afternoon, evening—those are times. So maybe the target is either a meal or a time. But the list includes both. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user didn't specify whether the target is a meal or a time. So I need to narrow it down. Let's start with a question that can split the list into two groups. For example, "Is the target a meal?" That would separate breakfast, brunch, lunchtime, suppertime from the others. Let's see how many are in each group. There are 4 meals and 4 times. So if the answer is yes, then the target is one of the four meals. If no, then one of the four times. That's a good first question.\\ \tt \\ \tt But wait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word
