I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is: Documents, Self, Bush, Plant, Mushrooms, PCP, President, Mayor.\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. Some of these are nouns, some might be proper nouns. Let's break them down:\n\n- Documents: a general term for written records.\n- Self: refers to oneself, a pronoun.\n- Bush: could be a plant (like a shrub) or the last US president (George H.W. Bush), or maybe a family name.\n- Plant: a living organism, or a factory.\n- Mushrooms: fungi, edible.\n- PCP: a chemical compound (phencyclidine), also slang for a drug.\n- President: a political position.\n- Mayor: another political position, usually of a city.\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nPolitical titles: President, Mayor. But Bush is a person's last name, but could refer to a president. PCP is a drug, Mushrooms are fungi, Plant could be a living thing or a factory, Documents are written, Self is a pronoun.\n\nAlternatively, think about parts of speech. Self is a pronoun, others are nouns. But the rules say questions can't be about structure or spelling, so maybe not. Wait, rule 2 says",
