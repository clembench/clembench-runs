	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Documents', 'Self', 'Bush', 'Plant', 'Mushrooms', 'PCP', 'President', 'Mayor']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is: Documents, Self, Bush, Plant, Mushrooms, PCP, President, Mayor.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. Some of these are nouns, some might be proper nouns. Let's break them down:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Documents: a general term for written records.\\ \tt - Self: refers to oneself, a pronoun.\\ \tt - Bush: could be a plant (like a shrub) or the last US president (George H.W. Bush), or maybe a family name.\\ \tt - Plant: a living organism, or a factory.\\ \tt - Mushrooms: fungi, edible.\\ \tt - PCP: a chemical compound (phencyclidine), also slang for a drug.\\ \tt - President: a political position.\\ \tt - Mayor: another political position, usually of a city.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\\ \tt \\ \tt Political titles: President, Mayor. But Bush is a person's last name, but could refer to a president. PCP is a drug, Mushrooms are fungi, Plant could be a living thing or a factory, Documents are written, Self is a pronoun.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about parts of speech. Self is a pronoun, others are nouns. But the rules say questions can't be about structure or spelling, so maybe not. Wait, rule 2 says
