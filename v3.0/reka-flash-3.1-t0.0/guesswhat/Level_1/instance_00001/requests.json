I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Private', 'Cadet', 'Mesa', 'Rock', 'Legos', 'Train', 'Dinero', 'Dime'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- Private: a military rank, also a noun meaning a person in the military.\n- Cadet: similar to private, a trainee in the military or aviation.\n- Mesa: a flat-topped hill, a type of geographical feature.\n- Rock: a large stone, or a musical genre.\n- Legos: the brand name for LEGO blocks, plural.\n- Train: a vehicle that runs on rails, or to train someone.\n- Dinero: Spanish for \"money\".\n- Dime: a coin worth 10 cents, or Spanish for \"ten\".\n\nHmm. So some are nouns, some are Spanish words, some are objects, some are places. Maybe I can categorize them.\n\nFirst, check if any are Spanish. Dinero and Dime are Spanish. So maybe a question like \"Is the target word Spanish?\" But wait, the rules say questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or characteristics. Wait, the second rule says questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking",
