	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Private', 'Cadet', 'Mesa', 'Rock', 'Legos', 'Train', 'Dinero', 'Dime']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Private', 'Cadet', 'Mesa', 'Rock', 'Legos', 'Train', 'Dinero', 'Dime'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Private: a military rank, also a noun meaning a person in the military.\\ \tt - Cadet: similar to private, a trainee in the military or aviation.\\ \tt - Mesa: a flat-topped hill, a type of geographical feature.\\ \tt - Rock: a large stone, or a musical genre.\\ \tt - Legos: the brand name for LEGO blocks, plural.\\ \tt - Train: a vehicle that runs on rails, or to train someone.\\ \tt - Dinero: Spanish for "money".\\ \tt - Dime: a coin worth 10 cents, or Spanish for "ten".\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. So some are nouns, some are Spanish words, some are objects, some are places. Maybe I can categorize them.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, check if any are Spanish. Dinero and Dime are Spanish. So maybe a question like "Is the target word Spanish?" But wait, the rules say questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or characteristics. Wait, the second rule says questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking
