The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center']",

The list is ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or groupings. Let's see. The words are White, Silver, Hutch, Chair, Sweatshirt, Shoes, Punter, Center. \n\nHmm. Some of these are colors (White, Silver), some are furniture (Chair), clothing items (Sweatshirt, Shoes), and others might be more specific (Hutch, Punter, Center). Maybe I can start by categorizing them. \n\nLet me think: Colors are White and Silver. Then there's Hutch, which is a type of furniture, maybe a cabinet. Chair is definitely furniture. Sweatshirt and Shoes are clothing. Punter could be a person in sports, like rugby or American football. Center could refer to a position in sports, a place, or a center in a room. \n\nSo maybe the first question is to determine if the target is a color. If yes, then it's either White or Silver. If no, then it's one of the others. Let's try that. \n\nQuestion 1: Is the target a color? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then next question could be between White and Silver. If no",
