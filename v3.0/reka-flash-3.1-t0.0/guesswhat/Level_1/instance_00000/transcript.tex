	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['White', 'Silver', 'Hutch', 'Chair', 'Sweatshirt', 'Shoes', 'Punter', 'Center'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should look for common categories or groupings. Let's see. The words are White, Silver, Hutch, Chair, Sweatshirt, Shoes, Punter, Center. \\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm. Some of these are colors (White, Silver), some are furniture (Chair), clothing items (Sweatshirt, Shoes), and others might be more specific (Hutch, Punter, Center). Maybe I can start by categorizing them. \\ \tt \\ \tt Let me think: Colors are White and Silver. Then there's Hutch, which is a type of furniture, maybe a cabinet. Chair is definitely furniture. Sweatshirt and Shoes are clothing. Punter could be a person in sports, like rugby or American football. Center could refer to a position in sports, a place, or a center in a room. \\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe the first question is to determine if the target is a color. If yes, then it's either White or Silver. If no, then it's one of the others. Let's try that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Question 1: Is the target a color? \\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then next question could be between White and Silver. If no
