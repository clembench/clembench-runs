The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Mosquito', 'Bee', 'Disco', 'Blues', 'Fog', 'Hurricane', 'Cannabis', 'Pepper']",

The list is ['Mosquito', 'Bee', 'Disco', 'Blues', 'Fog', 'Hurricane', 'Cannabis', 'Pepper'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. The words are a mix of animals, natural phenomena, music genres, plants, and maybe some other things. Let's categorize them:\n\n- Animals: Mosquito, Bee\n- Music genres: Blues, Disco\n- Natural phenomena: Fog, Hurricane\n- Plants: Cannabis, Pepper\n\nSo maybe the first question can split these into categories. Let's see. If I ask if the target is an animal, that would cover Mosquito and Bee. If the answer is yes, then I can focus on those two. If no, then check the other categories. Alternatively, maybe ask about music genre first. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, think about other attributes. For example, some of these are living things, others are not. Mosquito and Bee are living, Blues and Disco are music, Fog and Hurricane are weather, Cannabis and Pepper are plants. So maybe first question: Is the target a living creature? If yes, then Mosquito or Bee. If no, then the rest. Let's try that.\n\nBut wait, the rules say questions can't be about",
