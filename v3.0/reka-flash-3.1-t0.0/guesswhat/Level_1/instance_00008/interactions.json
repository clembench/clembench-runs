The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Cinnamon', 'Basil', 'Dog', 'Child', 'Latin', 'Classical', 'Coke', 'Lemonade']",

The list is ['Cinnamon', 'Basil', 'Dog', 'Child', 'Latin', 'Classical', 'Coke', 'Lemonade'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or themes. Let's see: Cinnamon and Basil are spices/herbs. Dog and Child are animals and people. Latin is a language, Classical might relate to a style or period. Coke and Lemonade are drinks. So maybe group them into categories like food/drink, plants, animals, language, etc.\n\nBut the questions can't be about the word's characteristics. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask if it's a spice or starts with a certain letter. Hmm, tricky. So the questions have to be about something else that relates to the word, but not the word's own attributes.\n\nWait, maybe the questions can be about associations. For example, \"Is the target word associated with a type of cuisine?\" But I'm not sure if that's allowed. The rules say the questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So maybe questions about associations are okay as long as they're not directly about the word's own properties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the words",
