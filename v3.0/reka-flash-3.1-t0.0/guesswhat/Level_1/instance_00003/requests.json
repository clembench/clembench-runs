Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- Semi: a type of vehicle (like a semi-truck)\n- Sled: a toy or vehicle for snow\n- Mailman: a person who delivers mail\n- Scientist: a person who does research\n- Clover: a plant with three leaves\n- Broccoli: a vegetable\n- Foyer: an entrance hall in a building\n- Garage: a building for storing vehicles\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nPeople: Mailman, Scientist\nPlants/food: Clover, Broccoli\nPlaces: Foyer, Garage\nObjects: Semi, Sled\n\nSo maybe start by asking if the target is a person. That could split the list into two groups. Let's try that.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target a person? If yes, then possible words are Mailman, Scientist. If no, then the rest.\n\nWait, but the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling, but can be about category. So that's allowed. Let's go with that.\n\nIf the answer is yes,",
