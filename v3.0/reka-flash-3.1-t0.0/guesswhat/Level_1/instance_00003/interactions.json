The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage']",

The list is ['Semi', 'Sled', 'Mailman', 'Scientist', 'Clover', 'Broccoli', 'Foyer', 'Garage'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's list them out:\n\n- Semi: a type of vehicle (like a semi-truck)\n- Sled: a toy or vehicle for snow\n- Mailman: a person who delivers mail\n- Scientist: a person who does research\n- Clover: a plant with three leaves\n- Broccoli: a vegetable\n- Foyer: an entrance hall in a building\n- Garage: a building for storing vehicles\n\nHmm. Maybe categorize them. Let's see:\n\nPeople: Mailman, Scientist\nPlants/food: Clover, Broccoli\nPlaces: Foyer, Garage\nObjects: Semi, Sled\n\nSo maybe start by asking if the target is a person. That could split the list into two groups. Let's try that.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target a person? If yes, then possible words are Mailman, Scientist. If no, then the rest.\n\nWait, but the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling, but can be about category. So that's allowed. Let's go with that.\n\nIf the answer is yes,",
