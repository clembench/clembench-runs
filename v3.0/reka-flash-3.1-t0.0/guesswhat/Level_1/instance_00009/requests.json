Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is: Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach, Scarf, Gloves, Heirlooms, Clothes.\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common theme. Let's go through each one:\n\n- Running: An action, related to sports, maybe athletics.\n- Track: Could be a sports track or a railway track. But in sports, it's where running happens.\n- Cornerback: A position in American football.\n- Coach: Someone who trains athletes.\n- Scarf: Clothing item, worn around the neck.\n- Gloves: Clothing, worn on hands.\n- Heirlooms: Items passed down through generations, often valuable.\n- Clothes: General term for clothing.\n\nHmm, so some are sports-related (Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach), some are clothing items (Scarf, Gloves, Clothes), and Heirlooms are more about inheritance. Maybe I can split them into categories first.\n\nLet me start with a broad question. Let's see, if I ask if the target is a type of clothing. That would include Scarf, Gloves, Clothes. If the answer is yes, then I can narrow down to those three. If no, then it's either sports-related (Running, Track, Cornerback, Coach) or Heirlooms.\n\nWait",
