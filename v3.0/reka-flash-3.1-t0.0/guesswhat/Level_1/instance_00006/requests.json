Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Foot', 'Millimeter', 'Mamba', 'King', 'Tricycle', 'Dollhouse', 'Sauce', 'Garlic'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. Let's see. The words are a mix of objects, animals, measurements, and maybe some food. Let's categorize them:\n\n- Foot: body part\n- Millimeter: unit of measurement\n- Mamba: snake\n- King: royalty\n- Tricycle: vehicle\n- Dollhouse: furniture/toy\n- Sauce: food condiment\n- Garlic: food ingredient\n\nHmm. Maybe start by splitting into broader categories. Let's see. Are there more than four categories here? Maybe. Let's try to divide them into two groups. For example, living vs non-living. Let's check:\n\nFoot (body part) - living\nMillimeter (measurement) - non-living\nMamba (animal) - living\nKing (royalty) - non-living (though a person, but maybe considered non-living as an object)\nTricycle (vehicle) - non-living\nDollhouse (furniture) - non-living\nSauce (food) - non-living\nGarlic (food) - non-living\n\nWait, but King is a",
