The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The user said the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does it start with a T?\" or \"How many letters does it have?\" That's a bit tricky because usually, those are the first questions in a guessing game. But since I can't use those, I have to think of other categories or associations.\n\nLet me look at the list again. The words are a mix of gemstones (Topaz, Sapphire), clothing (Blouse), accessories (Glasses), musical instruments (Tuba), household items (Alarm), and legal terms (Burglary, Rape). Wait, Rape is a sensitive term here. I need to be careful with that. The user might have included it, but I should handle it respectfully. But maybe the game is intended for a general audience, so I'll proceed but be cautious.\n\nSo the categories here are: jewelry/gemstones, clothing, accessories, musical instruments, household items, legal terms. Maybe I can ask a question that categorizes them. For example, \"Is the target word a type of jewelry?\" If the answer is yes, then Topaz and Sapphire are possible. If no, then the others. Let's",
