Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['tsar', 'king', 'princes', 'prince', 'noon', 'dusk', 'afternoon', 'evening'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. Let's categorize them. \n\nTsar is a historical title for an emperor in Russia. King is a similar royal title. Princes and prince are related to royalty as well. Noon, dusk, afternoon, evening are all times of day. So the list has both royal titles and times of day. That's a good split. Maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a royal title or a time of day. \n\nIf I ask, \"Is the target a royal title?\" The answer would help narrow it down. Let's see: if yes, then the options are tsar, king, prince, princes. If no, then noon, dusk, afternoon, evening. \n\nBut wait, the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking if it's a royal title is allowed because it's about the meaning, not the word's form. \n\nSo first question: QUESTION: Is the target a royal title? \n\nIf the answer is yes, then the next step is to narrow down among tsar, king,",
