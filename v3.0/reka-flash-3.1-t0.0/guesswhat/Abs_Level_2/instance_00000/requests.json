Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['hurdle', 'fencing','surfing','swimming', 'hostile', 'friendly', 'leader', 'extrovert'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['hurdle', 'fencing','surfing','swimming', 'hostile', 'friendly', 'leader', 'extrovert'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or themes. Let's see. Some words are activities (hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming), others are adjectives (hostile, friendly), and then there are nouns like leader and extrovert. Maybe I can start by categorizing them.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target word an adjective? If yes, then hostile, friendly, extrovert are possibilities. If no, then it's a noun or verb. Let's check. The list has nouns and verbs. For example, 'hurdle' is a noun, 'fencing' can be a noun or verb,'surfing' is a noun or verb,'swimming' is a verb or noun. Hostile and friendly are adjectives, leader is a noun, extrovert is an adjective. So if the answer is yes, then hostile, friendly, extrovert. If no, then the rest.\n\nBut the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking if it's an adjective is allowed? Wait, the rules say questions can't be related to the structure, spelling,",
