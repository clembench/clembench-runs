The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['hurdle', 'fencing', 'surfing', 'swimming', 'hostile', 'friendly', 'leader', 'extrovert']",

The list is ['hurdle', 'fencing','surfing','swimming', 'hostile', 'friendly', 'leader', 'extrovert'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or themes. Let's see. Some words are activities (hurdle, fencing, surfing, swimming), others are adjectives (hostile, friendly), and then there are nouns like leader and extrovert. Maybe I can start by categorizing them.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target word an adjective? If yes, then hostile, friendly, extrovert are possibilities. If no, then it's a noun or verb. Let's check. The list has nouns and verbs. For example, 'hurdle' is a noun, 'fencing' can be a noun or verb,'surfing' is a noun or verb,'swimming' is a verb or noun. Hostile and friendly are adjectives, leader is a noun, extrovert is an adjective. So if the answer is yes, then hostile, friendly, extrovert. If no, then the rest.\n\nBut the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling. So asking if it's an adjective is allowed? Wait, the rules say questions can't be related to the structure, spelling,",
