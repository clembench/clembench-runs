Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['pathology', 'radiology', 'oncology', 'dermatology', 'gp','surgeon', 'dentist', 'physician'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list includes medical specialties and some professions. The rules say I can't ask about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does it start with a vowel?\" or \"How many letters does it have?\" That complicates things a bit.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. The list has 'pathology', 'radiology', 'oncology', 'dermatology'—these are all medical specialties, typically departments in a hospital. Then there's 'gp' (general practitioner),'surgeon', 'dentist', 'physician'—these are types of medical professionals. So maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a medical specialty or a profession. That's a binary question. Let me check the rules again. The question can't be about the word's structure or spelling, but asking about the category (specialty vs. profession) should be okay. So first question: \"Is the target a medical specialty?\" If yes, then the target is one of the first four. If no, then it's one of the last four.\n\nLet's assume the answer is yes. Then the next step is to narrow down among pathology, radiology, oncology, dermatology. These are all specialties, but maybe they have different",
