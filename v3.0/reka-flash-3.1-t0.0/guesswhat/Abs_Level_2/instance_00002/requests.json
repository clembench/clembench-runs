Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['french','spanish', 'technology', 'engineering', 'twenty-three', 'eleven', 'one','seven'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words. Let's look at them:\n\n- Languages: french, spanish\n- Fields of study: technology, engineering\n- Numbers: twenty-three, eleven, one, seven\n\nSo there are three main categories here. Maybe I can start by asking if the target is a language. That's a good first question because it splits the list into two groups. If the answer is yes, then the target is either french or spanish. If no, then it's either technology, engineering, or a number.\n\nLet me try that. So first question: \"Is the target a language?\" If yes, then next questions can focus on distinguishing between french and spanish. If no, then maybe ask if it's a field of study (technology or engineering) or a number. But numbers are a bit different. Let's see.\n\nWait, the numbers here are 'twenty-three', 'eleven', 'one','seven'. So they are written out as words, not numerals. So maybe another way to categorize is numbers vs. non-numbers. Alternatively, maybe first check if it's a number. Let's see. If I ask",
