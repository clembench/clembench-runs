The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['grandson', 'granddaughter', 'mother-in-law', 'sister-in-law', 'trapezium', 'parallelogram', 'decahedron', 'dodecahedron']",

The list is: ['grandson', 'granddaughter','mother-in-law','sister-in-law', 'trapezium', 'parallelogram', 'decahedron', 'dodecahedron'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words to see if there's a pattern. Let's look at each one:\n\n- Grandson and granddaughter: These are terms related to family, specifically children of one's child.\n- Mother-in-law and sister-in-law: Also family terms, but different relationships (mother of one's spouse, sister of one's spouse or sibling).\n- Trapezium, parallelogram, decahedron, dodecahedron: These are geometric shapes. Trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. Parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel. Decahedron and dodecahedron are polyhedrons with 10 and 12 faces respectively.\n\nSo the list has four family-related terms and four geometric terms. That's a good split. Maybe I can start by asking a question that differentiates between these two groups. Since the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling, but can be about categories. Wait, the rules say questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of",
