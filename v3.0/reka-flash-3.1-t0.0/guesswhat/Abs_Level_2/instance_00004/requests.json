Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target. The list is ['half', 'quarter','sixteenth', 'ninth', 'taoism', 'jainism','scientology', 'buddhism']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, or parts of the word.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. Let's look at them. The first four are fractions: half, quarter, sixteenth, ninth. The next four are religions or philosophies: taoism, jainism, scientology, buddhism. So maybe the target is either a fraction or a religion. That's a big split. Let me start with that.\n\nQuestion 1: Is the target word a type of fraction? If yes, then we're looking at the first four. If no, then the latter four. Let's go with that. So the first question is \"QUESTION: Is the target word a type of fraction?\" \n\nIf the answer is yes, then the candidates are half, quarter, sixteenth, ninth. If no, then taoism, jainism, scientology, buddhism. Let's assume the answer is yes for",
