The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['nanometre', 'centimetre', 'mile', 'fathom', 'hairdresser', 'plumber', 'author', 'presenter']",

The list is: ['nanometre', 'centimetre','mile', 'fathom', 'hairdresser', 'plumber', 'author', 'presenter'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics that group some of these words together. Let's go through each word:\n\n- Nanometre and centimetre are units of length, specifically metric units.\n- Mile is also a unit of distance, but it's an imperial unit.\n- Fathom is a unit of depth, similar to a yard but used for water.\n- Hairdresser and plumber are occupations.\n- Author and presenter are also occupations, but different types (author writes, presenter presents).\n\nSo, there are two main groups here: units of measurement (nanometre, centimetre, mile, fathom) and occupations (hairdresser, plumber, author, presenter). That's four categories. Wait, actually, units of measurement and occupations. So maybe the target is in one of these groups. Let me check if there's another possible grouping. Maybe some are tools or something else? Let's see: nanometre is a unit, centimetre too, mile, fathom. Hairdresser uses scissors, comb, etc. Plumber uses pipes, wrenches. Author uses a pen, computer. Presenter uses a microphone, maybe a",
