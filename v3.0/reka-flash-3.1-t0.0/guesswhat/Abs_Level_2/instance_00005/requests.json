Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word','verb', 'adverb'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['sixth', 'fourth', 'third', 'tenth', 'name', 'word','verb', 'adverb'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common categories or characteristics. The words can be divided into ordinal numbers (sixth, fourth, third, tenth) and other words (name, word, verb, adverb). Maybe start by separating these two groups. If I can determine if the target is an ordinal or not, that narrows it down to 4 or 4 options.\n\nSo first question: Is the target word an ordinal number? That's a yes/no question. If yes, then the options are sixth, fourth, third, tenth. If no, then name, word, verb, adverb. Let's go with that.\n\nWait, but the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Wait, does asking if it's an ordinal number count as a characteristic? Hmm. The rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe asking about its category (like ordinal) is allowed? Because it's not about the word's structure but its type. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 2: The questions cannot be related to the structure",
