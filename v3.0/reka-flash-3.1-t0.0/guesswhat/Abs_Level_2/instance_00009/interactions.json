The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list is: ['shoplifting', 'robbery','stealing', 'burglary', 'building','monument', 'illustration', 'drawing'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common theme. Let's go through each one:\n\n- Shoplifting: This is a crime where someone steals goods from a shop.\n- Robbery: Involves taking something by force or threat of violence.\n- Stealing: General term for taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission.\n- Burglary: Breaking into a building to commit a crime, often theft.\n- Building: A structure constructed with walls and a roof.\n- Monument: A structure built to commemorate a person or event.\n- Illustration: A drawing that explains or illustrates something.\n- Drawing: The act of creating images with a pen, pencil, etc., or the result of that act.\n\nLooking at these, some are crimes (shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary), while others are nouns that are more about structures or art (building, monument, illustration, drawing). So maybe the target is either a crime or an art-related term. Let's check if there's a better way to split them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some are verbs and others are nouns. Wait, shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary are all nouns (types",
