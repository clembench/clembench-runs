I need to figure out which word is the target from the list provided. The list is: ['shoplifting', 'robbery','stealing', 'burglary', 'building','monument', 'illustration', 'drawing'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common theme. Let's go through each one:\n\n- Shoplifting: This is a crime where someone steals goods from a shop.\n- Robbery: Involves taking something by force or threat of violence.\n- Stealing: General term for taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission.\n- Burglary: Breaking into a building to commit a crime, often theft.\n- Building: A structure constructed with walls and a roof.\n- Monument: A structure built to commemorate a person or event.\n- Illustration: A drawing that explains or illustrates something.\n- Drawing: The act of creating images with a pen, pencil, etc., or the result of that act.\n\nLooking at these, some are crimes (shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary), while others are nouns that are more about structures or art (building, monument, illustration, drawing). So maybe the target is either a crime or an art-related term. Let's check if there's a better way to split them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some are verbs and others are nouns. Wait, shoplifting, robbery, stealing, burglary are all nouns (types",
