	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Propane', 'Kerosene', 'Petroleum', 'Coal', 'Major', 'Lieutenant', 'Corporal', 'Sergeant']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Propane', 'Kerosene', 'Petroleum', 'Coal', 'Major', 'Lieutenant', 'Corporal', 'Sergeant'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common theme. Let's look at each word:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Propane: A type of fuel, specifically a hydrocarbon gas.\\ \tt - Kerosene: Another fuel, used in lamps, jet engines, etc.\\ \tt - Petroleum: A fossil fuel, the source of many products like gasoline.\\ \tt - Coal: A solid fossil fuel used for energy.\\ \tt - Major: A military rank, higher than captain.\\ \tt - Lieutenant: A military rank, typically lower than captain.\\ \tt - Corporal: A non-commissioned officer rank, below sergeant.\\ \tt - Sergeant: A non-commissioned officer rank, higher than corporal.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, so there are both fuels (Propane, Kerosene, Petroleum, Coal) and military ranks (Major, Lieutenant, Corporal, Sergeant). That's two distinct categories. Maybe the target is in one of these groups. Let me check if the list has an even split. There are 4 fuels and 4 military ranks. So maybe the first question can split them into these two groups.\\ \tt \\ \tt Question 1: Is the target word a type of fuel or a
