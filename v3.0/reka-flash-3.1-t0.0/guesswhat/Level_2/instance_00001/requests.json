Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Minnow', 'Goldfish', 'Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Exclamation', 'Speaking', 'Adverb', 'Verb'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words. Let's look at them. The first four are all fish: Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder. Then there are Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb. So maybe the target is either a fish or a part of speech. That's a big split. Let me check if that's accurate. \n\nYes, Minnow, Goldfish, Halibut, Flounder are all types of fish. Exclamation is a noun, Speaking is a verb, Adverb and Verb are parts of speech. So two main categories: animals (specifically fish) and language terms. \n\nSo the first question should probably be to determine which category the target is in. That way, I can eliminate half the list. Let's ask: \"Is the target word a type of fish?\" If yes, then the possible words are the four fish. If no, then the remaining four are Exclamation, Speaking, Adverb, Verb. \n\nLet's go with that. Let's ask the first question.\n</reasoning>\n\nQUESTION: Is the target word a type of fish?\n\n <sep>",
