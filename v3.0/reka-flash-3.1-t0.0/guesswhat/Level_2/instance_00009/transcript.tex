	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these words. Let's look at the types. There are four trees: Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine. Then four animals: Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe. So maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a tree or an animal. That's a common way to split things. Let me check the rules again. The questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking if it's a tree or animal is allowed? Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is about the category of the word. Since the words are either trees or animals, that's a category. But does that count as a characteristic? The rules say "specific characteristics of a word itself". Maybe category is okay. Let me think. For example, if I ask "Is the target a type of tree?" that's about the category, not the word's structure. So maybe that's allowed. Let's go with that.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first question
