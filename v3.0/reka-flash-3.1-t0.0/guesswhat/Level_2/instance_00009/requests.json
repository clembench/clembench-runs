Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Beech', 'Willow', 'Cedar', 'Pine', 'Lion', 'Jaguar', 'Deer', 'Giraffe'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words. Let's look at the types. There are four trees: Beech, Willow, Cedar, Pine. Then four animals: Lion, Jaguar, Deer, Giraffe. So maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a tree or an animal. That's a common way to split things. Let me check the rules again. The questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So asking if it's a tree or animal is allowed? Wait, the rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Hmm. Wait, maybe the question is about the category of the word. Since the words are either trees or animals, that's a category. But does that count as a characteristic? The rules say \"specific characteristics of a word itself\". Maybe category is okay. Let me think. For example, if I ask \"Is the target a type of tree?\" that's about the category, not the word's structure. So maybe that's allowed. Let's go with that.\n\nSo first question",
