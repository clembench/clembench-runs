	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Cave', 'Cliff', 'Waterfall', 'Ocean', 'Kilometer', 'Centimeter', 'Furlong', 'Yard']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Cave', 'Cliff', 'Waterfall', 'Ocean', 'Kilometer', 'Centimeter', 'Furlong', 'Yard'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common theme or groupings. Let's look at each word:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Cave: A natural underground space.\\ \tt - Cliff: A steep rock face.\\ \tt - Waterfall: A cascade of water down a slope.\\ \tt - Ocean: A large body of salt water.\\ \tt - Kilometer: A unit of length (1000 meters).\\ \tt - Centimeter: A unit of length (0.01 meters).\\ \tt - Furlong: A unit of length (220 yards).\\ \tt - Yard: A unit of length (3 feet).\\ \tt \\ \tt So, some are natural features (Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean) and others are units of length (Kilometer, Centimeter, Furlong, Yard). That's a good split. Maybe I can start by asking if the target is a natural feature or a unit of length. That would split the list into two groups of four each. Let's go with that.\\ \tt \\ \tt Question 1: Is the target a natural feature? (Yes/No)\\ \tt \\ \tt If the answer is yes, then the possible words are Cave, Cliff, Waterfall, Ocean. If
