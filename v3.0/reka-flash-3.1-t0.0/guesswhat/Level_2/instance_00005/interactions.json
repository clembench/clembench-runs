The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Spoon', 'Cup', 'Bowl', 'Ladle', 'Tequila', 'Brandy', 'Margarita', 'Martini']",

The user said the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does the word start with a vowel?\" or \"How many letters does it have?\" Those are about the word's structure or spelling. So the questions have to be about something else related to the word's meaning or usage.\n\nFirst, maybe categorize the words. Let's look at the list. There are some kitchen utensils: Spoon, Cup, Bowl, Ladle. Then there are alcoholic beverages: Tequila, Brandy, Margarita, Martini. So maybe the target is either a utensil or a drink. That's a big split. Let me ask a question that can separate these two groups.\n\nSince the questions can't be about the word's structure, I can't ask if it's a noun or a verb. Wait, but maybe I can ask if it's used for drinking. Wait, but the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe I can ask about the primary use of the item. For example, \"Is the target word primarily used for drinking?\" But wait, the question is about the word's meaning, not",
