The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Asparagus', 'Celery', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Television', 'Radio', 'Noisemaker', 'Fan']",

The list is: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke, Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\n\nThe rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, parts of speech, etc. They have to be more about associations or categories.\n\nFirst, I should categorize the words. Let's look at the list. There are some vegetables: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke. Then there are electronic devices: Television, Radio. Then there are objects that make noise: Noisemaker, Fan. Wait, Fan is a bit ambiguous. A fan can be a device that moves air (like a ceiling fan) or a person who supports something (a fan of a team). But in the list, maybe it's referring to the device. Similarly, Noisemaker is something that makes noise, like a party popper or a whistle. So maybe the categories are vegetables, electronics, and noise-making objects.\n\nSo maybe the first question is to determine which category the target word is in. Let's see. If I ask, \"Is the target word a type of vegetable?\" The answer could help narrow",
