	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Asparagus', 'Celery', 'Spinach', 'Artichoke', 'Television', 'Radio', 'Noisemaker', 'Fan']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list provided. The list is: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke, Television, Radio, Noisemaker, Fan.\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, parts of speech, etc. They have to be more about associations or categories.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize the words. Let's look at the list. There are some vegetables: Asparagus, Celery, Spinach, Artichoke. Then there are electronic devices: Television, Radio. Then there are objects that make noise: Noisemaker, Fan. Wait, Fan is a bit ambiguous. A fan can be a device that moves air (like a ceiling fan) or a person who supports something (a fan of a team). But in the list, maybe it's referring to the device. Similarly, Noisemaker is something that makes noise, like a party popper or a whistle. So maybe the categories are vegetables, electronics, and noise-making objects.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe the first question is to determine which category the target word is in. Let's see. If I ask, "Is the target word a type of vegetable?" The answer could help narrow
