I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Gardenia', 'Lilac', 'Pansy', 'Violet', 'Bee', 'Ant', 'Centipede', 'Millipede'].\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words. Let's look at them. There are flowers: Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet. Then there are insects: Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede. So maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a flower or an insect. That would split the list into two groups of four each. Let's go with that.\n\nSo first question: Is the target a flower? If yes, then the possible words are Gardenia, Lilac, Pansy, Violet. If no, then Bee, Ant, Centipede, Millipede. Let's ask that.\n\nWait, but the rules say the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Wait, does asking if it's a flower count as a characteristic? Hmm. The rules say the questions can't be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Wait, maybe \"specific characteristics\" refers to things like letters, syllables, etc. But asking if it's a flower is about its category. Maybe",
