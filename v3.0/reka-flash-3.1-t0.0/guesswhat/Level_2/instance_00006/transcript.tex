	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Canoe', 'Skiff', 'Battleship', 'Destroyer', 'Flood', 'Earthquake', 'Typhoon', 'Tornado']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list provided. The list is ['Canoe', 'Skiff', 'Battleship', 'Destroyer', 'Flood', 'Earthquake', 'Typhoon', 'Tornado']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask things like "Does it start with a C?" or "How many letters does it have?".\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to categorize these words. Let's look at them:\\ \tt \\ \tt - Canoe, Skiff: These are types of boats or watercraft.\\ \tt - Battleship, Destroyer: These are types of warships.\\ \tt - Flood: A natural event involving water overflow.\\ \tt - Earthquake: A seismic event causing ground shaking.\\ \tt - Typhoon, Tornado: Both are types of storms, but different in nature. Typhoons are tropical cyclones, while tornadoes are rotating columns of air.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the list has two groups: watercraft/boats, warships, natural disasters (flood, earthquake, typhoon, tornado). Wait, Flood is a natural event, Earthquake is another, Typhoon and Tornado are weather phenomena. So maybe the categories are:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Boats (Canoe, Skiff)\\ \tt 2. Warships
