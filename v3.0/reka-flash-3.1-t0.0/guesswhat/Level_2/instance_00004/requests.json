Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible.

Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Lawyer', 'Attorney', 'Clerk', 'Salesperson', 'Screwdriver', 'Awl', 'Knife', 'Axe'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word is the target from the list: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson, Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. The user said the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask things like \"Does the word start with a vowel?\" or \"How many letters does it have?\" Those are out.\n\nSo the questions have to be about the meaning or the role of the word. Since the answer is yes or no, I need to narrow down the list by asking questions that can split the options into groups. Let's start by looking at the list. There are eight words. Let's categorize them to see if there's a common theme or possible overlaps.\n\nFirst, professions: Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson. Then tools: Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. So maybe the target is either a profession or a tool. That's a big split. If I can determine which category it's in, that would cut the list in half. Let's try that.\n\nQuestion: Is the target word a type of profession? If yes, then the options are Lawyer, Attorney, Clerk, Salesperson. If no, then Screwdriver, Awl, Knife, Axe. That's a good first question because it splits the list into two groups of four. Let's go with that.\n\nWait, but the",
