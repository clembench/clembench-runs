The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Lettuce', 'Kale', 'Avocado', 'Grape', 'Bassoon', 'Oboe', 'Clarinet', 'Saxophone']",

The user said the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, parts of the word, etc. The answers are only yes or no.\n\nHmm. So the questions have to be about something else related to the word. Maybe categories? Like, is it a vegetable? Or an instrument? Wait, but the words are a mix of vegetables and musical instruments. Lettuce, Kale, Avocado, Grape are all vegetables. Bassoon, Oboe, Clarinet, Saxophone are musical instruments. So maybe the first question is to determine if the target is a vegetable or an instrument. That could split the list into two groups of four each. Let me check the list again. Yes, four veggies and four instruments. So if I ask, \"Is the target a vegetable?\" The answer would narrow it down to four or four. Then depending on the answer, I can focus on one group.\n\nBut wait, the user said the questions can't be related to the structure or spelling of the word. But asking if it's a vegetable or an instrument is about its category, which is allowed. Because it's not about the word's structure. So",
