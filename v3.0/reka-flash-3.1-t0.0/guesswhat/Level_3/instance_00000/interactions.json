The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Banjo', 'Guitar', 'Drum', 'Cymbal', 'Bugle', 'Trombone', 'Mandolin', 'Harp']",

The list is ['Banjo', 'Guitar', 'Drum', 'Cymbal', 'Bugle', 'Trombone', 'Mandolin', 'Harp'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. All of them are musical instruments, right? So maybe the first question can eliminate some non-musical items, but wait, all are musical. Hmm. Wait, the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. So I need to think of other categories. Maybe the type of instrument, like percussion vs. string vs. brass, etc.\n\nLet me categorize them:\n\n- Percussion: Drum, Cymbal\n- String: Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Harp\n- Brass: Bugle, Trombone\n\nSo maybe the first question is about the category. But how to phrase it without mentioning the categories? Wait, the rules say questions can't be about the structure or spelling of the word itself, but they can be about the word's meaning. So asking about the type of instrument is allowed.\n\nSo first question: Is the target word a percussion instrument? Possible answers: yes or no. If yes, then the target is Drum or C",
