The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list is ['Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Carp', 'Catfish', 'Grouper', 'Mackerel', 'Minnow', 'Goldfish']. The user wants me to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down in 7 steps, then guess.\n\nFirst, I should think about common characteristics of these fish. Maybe start with something broad. Let's see. Are all these fish saltwater or freshwater? Some are both, but maybe some are more associated with one. For example, Carp is freshwater, right? Goldfish too. Halibut, Flounder, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow—those are typically saltwater. So if I ask if the target is a freshwater fish, that could split the list. Let's check: Carp, Catfish, Goldfish are freshwater. The others are saltwater. Wait, Catfish can live in both, but maybe commonly associated with freshwater. So if the answer is yes, then the target is among Carp, Catfish, Goldfish. If no, then Halibut, Flounder, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow. That's a good split.\n\nSo first question: Is the target a freshwater fish? Let's go with that. If yes, then next step. If no, then proceed with saltwater. Let",
