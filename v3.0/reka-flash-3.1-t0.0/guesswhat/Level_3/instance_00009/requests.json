I need to figure out which fish is the target word from the list provided. The list is ['Halibut', 'Flounder', 'Carp', 'Catfish', 'Grouper', 'Mackerel', 'Minnow', 'Goldfish']. The user wants me to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down in 7 steps, then guess.\n\nFirst, I should think about common characteristics of these fish. Maybe start with something broad. Let's see. Are all these fish saltwater or freshwater? Some are both, but maybe some are more associated with one. For example, Carp is freshwater, right? Goldfish too. Halibut, Flounder, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow—those are typically saltwater. So if I ask if the target is a freshwater fish, that could split the list. Let's check: Carp, Catfish, Goldfish are freshwater. The others are saltwater. Wait, Catfish can live in both, but maybe commonly associated with freshwater. So if the answer is yes, then the target is among Carp, Catfish, Goldfish. If no, then Halibut, Flounder, Grouper, Mackerel, Minnow. That's a good split.\n\nSo first question: Is the target a freshwater fish? Let's go with that. If yes, then next step. If no, then proceed with saltwater. Let",
