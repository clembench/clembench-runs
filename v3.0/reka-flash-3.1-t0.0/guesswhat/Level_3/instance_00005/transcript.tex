	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Turquoise', 'Opal', 'Topaz', 'Amethyst', 'Pearl', 'Ruby', 'Aquamarine', 'Emerald']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which gemstone is the target word from the list provided. The list is ['Turquoise', 'Opal', 'Topaz', 'Amethyst', 'Pearl', 'Ruby', 'Aquamarine', 'Emerald']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, or parts of the word. They have to be about the meaning or associations.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about common properties or associations of these gemstones. Maybe color? But some of these have similar colors. For example, Ruby is red, Emerald is green, Amethyst is purple, Topaz can be various colors, Opal has flashes, Turquoise is blue, Aquamarine is blue-green, Pearl is white or off-white. But asking about color might be tricky because some are similar. Alternatively, maybe think about their hardness on the Mohs scale? But that might be too technical. Or their origin? Like where they're commonly found. Or their historical significance. Or maybe their use in jewelry, like which are used in engagement rings, etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about their properties. For example, Pearl is an organic material, while others are minerals. But I'm not sure if that's a yes/no
