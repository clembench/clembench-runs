Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Bug', 'Termite', 'Ant', 'Bee', 'Gnat', 'Mosquito', 'Butterfly', 'Moth'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Bug', 'Termite', 'Ant', 'Bee', 'Gnat', 'Mosquito', 'Butterfly', 'Moth'].\n\nFirst, I should look for common characteristics among these words. All of them are insects, right? So maybe the first question can eliminate some non-insects, but wait, all the candidates are insects. So maybe that's not helpful. Wait, the rules say the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. So I have to think of other attributes.\n\nSince they are all insects, maybe their behavior, habitat, diet, or other biological traits. Let's see. For example, do they have wings? Well, most of these do. Butterflies and moths have wings, but so do bees, ants, etc. Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe their diet. Some are pollinators, others are blood-suckers. Mosquitoes and gnats are blood-suckers. Ants, bees, termites, butterflies, moths are not. So if I ask if the target is a blood-sucking insect, that could split the list. Let's see: the words that are blood-suckers are Mosquito,",
