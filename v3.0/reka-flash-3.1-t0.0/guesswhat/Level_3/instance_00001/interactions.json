The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

The list is ['Gardenia', 'Lilac', 'Tulip', 'Lily', 'Pansy', 'Violet', 'Marigold', 'Petunia']. The user wants me to ask yes/no questions to narrow it down in 7 steps, then guess.\n\nFirst, I should think about common characteristics of flowers. Maybe color? But the rules say questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. Wait, does that mean I can't ask about color? Let me check the rules again. Rule 2 says questions can't be related to structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So maybe color is a characteristic of the flower, not the word. Hmm, but the answer is based on the flower's attributes. Wait, the target word is a flower name, so the questions are about the flower's attributes. But the rules say the questions can't be about the structure or spelling of the word. So maybe I can ask about the flower's color, shape, season it blooms, etc. Because those are characteristics of the flower, not the word itself.\n\nWait, the user says \"the questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself\". So the question can't be about the letters in the word, like how",
