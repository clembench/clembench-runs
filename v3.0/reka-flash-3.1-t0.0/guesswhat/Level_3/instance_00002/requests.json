Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief.

Let’s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Nephew', 'Uncle', 'Grandfather', 'Grandmother', 'Father', 'Mother', 'Wife', 'Husband'] <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list includes family relations: Nephew, Uncle, Grandfather, Grandmother, Father, Mother, Wife, Husband.\n\nFirst, I should categorize these words to see if there's a common thread. Let's break them down by generation and gender. \n\nFather, Mother, Grandfather, Grandmother are parents/grandparents. Nephew and Uncle are male terms, while Wife and Husband are spouses. Wait, Uncle is a brother of one's parent, so he's a male sibling-in-law. Nephew is the son of one's sibling. So maybe I can split them into different categories.\n\nAlternatively, think about the relationships. Let's see:\n\n- Parents: Father, Mother\n- Grandparents: Grandfather, Grandmother\n- Siblings-in-law: Uncle, Aunt (but Aunt isn't in the list)\n- Children-in-law: Husband, Wife\n- Nephews/nieces: Nephew, Niece (but Niece isn't here)\n\nSo the list has two parents, two grandparents, two spouses, and one nephew. Wait, the list is ['Nephew', 'Uncle', 'Grandfather', 'Grandmother', 'Father', 'Mother', 'Wife', 'Husband']. So there are two parents, two grandparents, two spouses, and one nephew",
