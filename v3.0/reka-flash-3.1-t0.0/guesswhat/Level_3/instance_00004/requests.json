I need to figure out which fruit is the target word from the list provided. The list is ['Pineapple', 'Banana', 'Melon', 'Pear', 'Lemon', 'Orange', 'Apricot', 'Mango']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, or parts of the word. They have to be about the meaning or associations.\n\nFirst, I should think about common features among these fruits. Let's list them out:\n\n- Pineapple: tropical, has a spiky exterior, sweet and tangy.\n- Banana: yellow, curved, often associated with monkeys.\n- Melon: round, can be honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon.\n- Pear: tree fruit, sometimes green or red, slightly crunchy.\n- Lemon: citrus, sour, yellow, used in cooking.\n- Orange: citrus, sweet, orange color, often segmented.\n- Apricot: small, orange or yellow, stone fruit.\n- Mango: tropical, sweet, often red or yellow, has a pit.\n\nHmm. Maybe start by categorizing them. Let's see if they can be divided into citrus fruits and non-citrus. Citrus fruits are Lemon, Orange, maybe",
