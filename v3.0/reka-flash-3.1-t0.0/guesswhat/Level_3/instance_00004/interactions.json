The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\n\nThe rules of the game are: \n\n1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\n\n2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". \n\n3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nQUESTION: <your question>\n\n4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \n\nGUESS: <target word>\n\nRemember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\n\nList of candidate words: ['Pineapple', 'Banana', 'Melon', 'Pear', 'Lemon', 'Orange', 'Apricot', 'Mango']",

The list is ['Pineapple', 'Banana', 'Melon', 'Pear', 'Lemon', 'Orange', 'Apricot', 'Mango']. The rules say I can ask up to 7 yes/no questions, but I have to make sure my final guess is correct. The questions can't be about the word's structure, spelling, or specific characteristics. So I can't ask about letters, syllables, or parts of the word. They have to be about the meaning or associations.\n\nFirst, I should think about common features among these fruits. Let's list them out:\n\n- Pineapple: tropical, has a spiky exterior, sweet and tangy.\n- Banana: yellow, curved, often associated with monkeys.\n- Melon: round, can be honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon.\n- Pear: tree fruit, sometimes green or red, slightly crunchy.\n- Lemon: citrus, sour, yellow, used in cooking.\n- Orange: citrus, sweet, orange color, often segmented.\n- Apricot: small, orange or yellow, stone fruit.\n- Mango: tropical, sweet, often red or yellow, has a pit.\n\nHmm. Maybe start by categorizing them. Let's see if they can be divided into citrus fruits and non-citrus. Citrus fruits are Lemon, Orange, maybe",
