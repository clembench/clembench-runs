	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Stockings', 'Tights', 'Scarf', 'Shirt', 'Panties', 'Pants', 'Underwear', 'Bra']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target using up to 7 yes/no questions. The list is ['Stockings', 'Tights', 'Scarf', 'Shirt', 'Panties', 'Pants', 'Underwear', 'Bra'].\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these items. Let's see: Clothing items. Let's break them down by type. \\ \tt \\ \tt Stockings and Tights are both types of legwear. Scarf is an accessory. Shirt is a top. Panties and Pants are lower body wear. Underwear is a general term, but it's also listed as a separate item. Bra is a type of underwear for women. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, Underwear is listed as a separate item, but some of the others like Panties, Pants, Bra are also underwear. So maybe the target is one of these. But how to differentiate?\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules say questions can't be about structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. So I have to ask about attributes related to the item's use, category, etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt First question: Maybe start by determining if the item is worn on the upper body or lower body. For example, "Is the target word an item worn on the upper body?" Let's see. The upper body items here are Stockings (no, they're legs), Tights (no
