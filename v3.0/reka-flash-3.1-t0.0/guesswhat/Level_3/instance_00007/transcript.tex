	 Let's play a guessing game. Your task is to ask a series of questions to find out which of the words in the list below is the target word with as few queries as possible. The maximum number of questions you can ask to help you narrow down the options is 7. Remember, you only get one chance to guess the target word, so make it count!\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules of the game are: \\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Only ask one question per turn. DO NOT ASK MORE THAN ONE QUESTION.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. The questions cannot be related to the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of a word itself, and it can only be answered with "yes" or "no". \\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Use the following format for asking questions and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: <your question>\\ \tt \\ \tt 4. You have only one opportunity to guess the target word. To make your guess, use the following format and DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT OTHER THAN THIS: \\ \tt \\ \tt GUESS: <target word>\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember you cannot ask for a hint. Make your question brief. Letâ€™s start!\\ \tt \\ \tt List of candidate words: ['Canoe', 'Dinghy', 'Battleship', 'Destroyer', 'Tugboat', 'Ferry', 'Pontoon', 'Houseboat']

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out which word from the list is the target. The list includes various watercraft: Canoe, Dinghy, Battleship, Destroyer, Tugboat, Ferry, Pontoon, Houseboat. The user said the questions can't be about the structure, spelling, or specific characteristics of the word itself. So I can't ask about letters or syllables. Each question has to be a yes/no that narrows down the options.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should categorize these words. Let's see. Battleship, Destroyer, and Tugboat are types of warships. Canoe, Dinghy, Ferry, Pontoon, Houseboat are more civilian or recreational watercraft. Wait, Pontoon is a type of boat, but sometimes used as part of other boats. Houseboat is a boat that's permanently moored. Ferry is a vehicle for transporting people/cars across water. Canoe and Dinghy are small, open boats. Tugboat is a small ship used to push/pull larger vessels. Battleship and Destroyer are large warships.\\ \tt \\ \tt So maybe the first question can be about whether the target is a warship. If the answer is yes, then the options are Battleship, Destroyer, Tugboat. Wait, but Tugboat isn't a warship. So if the answer is yes, then it's Battleship or Destroyer. If no, then the other group
