	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Study room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Study room, and I'm currently in the Craft room. The available direction here is east. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably start by moving east since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving east will lead me closer to the Study room? Maybe the layout of the rooms is such that east from the Craft room is a path towards the Study. But without a map, I have to make educated guesses based on the information given each step.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the first move is to go east. Let's do that. If I go east from the Craft room, where would that take me? Maybe to another room like a Library or a Hallway. Then, from there, I can check the available directions again. The key is to keep moving in a way that logically progresses towards the Study room. If I hit a dead end, I might have to backtrack, but since the example shows moving in a straight line, maybe there's a direct path.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example had the user moving west then north, which seems like a path leading to the target. So perhaps the Study room is in a specific direction relative to the Craft room. Since the only available direction here is east, maybe that's the right way. Let's proceed with GO: east.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
