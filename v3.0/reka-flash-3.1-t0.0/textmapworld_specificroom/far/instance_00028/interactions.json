Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Study room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by moving east since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving east will lead me closer to the Study room? Maybe the layout of the rooms is such that east from the Craft room is a path towards the Study. But without a map, I have to make educated guesses based on the information given each step.\n\nSo, the first move is to go east. Let's do that. If I go east from the Craft room, where would that take me? Maybe to another room like a Library or a Hallway. Then, from there, I can check the available directions again. The key is to keep moving in a way that logically progresses towards the Study room. If I hit a dead end, I might have to backtrack, but since the example shows moving in a straight line, maybe there's a direct path.\n\nWait, the example had the user moving west then north, which seems like a path leading to the target. So perhaps the Study room is in a specific direction relative to the Craft room. Since the only available direction here is east, maybe that's the right way. Let's proceed with GO: east.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: east\n\n <sep> human:",
