	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Guest room. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Guest room, and I'm starting in the Bathroom. The available directions are south and west. I need to figure out which direction to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe I should try to explore systematically. Let's say I go south first. If that leads me somewhere that connects to other rooms, I can keep moving. Alternatively, going west might take me to another area. But without knowing the layout of the house, it's a bit random. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe I should prioritize directions. Let's pick one direction, say south. If I go south from the Bathroom, where would that lead? Maybe to a hallway or another room. Then from there, I can check available directions again. If I reach the Guest room, then I'm done. Otherwise, I can backtrack. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, going west might lead to another room like a Closet or a Closet. Wait, the example had a Kitchen leading to a Lobby. Maybe the Bathroom is connected to a Closet west and a hallway south. But I don't know for sure. \\ \tt \\ \tt Since the example started in the Kitchen and went west to Lobby, then north, maybe similar logic applies here. Let's try going south first. So the first move would be GO: south. Then, whatever room I enter, I can check directions again. If that doesn't lead to the Guest room, I can try other directions. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the Guest room is in a different part of
