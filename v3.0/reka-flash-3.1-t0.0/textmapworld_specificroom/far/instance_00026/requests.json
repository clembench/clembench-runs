If that leads me somewhere that connects to other rooms, I can keep moving. Alternatively, going west might take me to another area. But without knowing the layout of the house, it's a bit random. \n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize directions. Let's pick one direction, say south. If I go south from the Bathroom, where would that lead? Maybe to a hallway or another room. Then from there, I can check available directions again. If I reach the Guest room, then I'm done. Otherwise, I can backtrack. \n\nAlternatively, going west might lead to another room like a Closet or a Closet. Wait, the example had a Kitchen leading to a Lobby. Maybe the Bathroom is connected to a Closet west and a hallway south. But I don't know for sure. \n\nSince the example started in the Kitchen and went west to Lobby, then north, maybe similar logic applies here. Let's try going south first. So the first move would be GO: south. Then, whatever room I enter, I can check directions again. If that doesn't lead to the Guest room, I can try other directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Guest room is in a different part of",
