Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Study room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the goal is to reach the Study room. Since I'm in the Craft room and can only go west, I have to assume that west might lead towards the Study room. But wait, how do I know? Maybe the Study is in another direction, but since there's only west available here, I have to go west. There's no other choice. So the next step is to go west from the Craft room. \n\nWait, but maybe the Study room is in a different direction. But without any prior knowledge of the map, I have to make a decision based on the available options. Since the only direction given is west, I have to choose that. Unless there's some strategy here, like backtracking or something, but the problem doesn't mention that. The example just goes in the available direction. So in the example, they went west from Kitchen to Lobby, then north, etc. So following that pattern, if the only available direction is west, then GO: west is the answer. \n\nBut wait, maybe the Study room is in the opposite direction? But how would I know? The problem doesn't give any clues about the layout. So the only possible move is west. So the answer should be GO: west. Then, after moving,",
