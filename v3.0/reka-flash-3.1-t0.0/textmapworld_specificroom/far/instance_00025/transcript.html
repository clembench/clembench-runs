        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. The target room is Conservatory. You are in the Study room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?<br/></p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>The target room is the Conservatory, and I&#x27;m starting in the Study. The available directions are north and west. I need to figure out which direction to go first.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe I should try to map out the possible paths. But since I don&#x27;t have a map, I have to make educated guesses. Let&#x27;s think about common layouts. In many mystery games or escape rooms, the rooms are arranged in a grid. The Study is often near other rooms like the Library or maybe the Hall. If I go north from the Study, maybe that leads to the Library or another room. Going west might take me to the Hall or perhaps the Kitchen. <br/><br/>Wait, but without knowing the actual layout, it&#x27;s tricky. Maybe I should try one direction first. Let&#x27;s say I go north. If that&#x27;s a dead end, I can backtrack. Alternatively, west might lead to a different area. But how do I decide which is more likely to be on the path to the Conservatory?<br/><br/>Alternatively, maybe the Conservatory is in a different wing. For example, in some setups, the Study is in the east wing, and the Conservatory is in the west. But that&#x27;s just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the Conservatory is near the Kitchen or Dining Room. <br/><br/>Wait, the example given earlier had the target as Bedroom, starting in Kitchen, going west to Lobby, then north to Bedroom. So in that case, the path was Kitchen -&gt;</p>
