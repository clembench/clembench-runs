Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen.

What is your next instruction?\n <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nThe target room is the Utility room, and I'm starting in the Home theater. The available direction here is west. So I need to go west to move to the neighboring room. The example shows that when you reach the target room, you say DONE. So first step is to go west from Home theater. Let me check if there's any other info. The user hasn't provided the layout of the house, so I have to assume that moving west from Home theater leads to another room, maybe the Utility room? But I don't know. The example had the user moving through several rooms until they found the target. So maybe the correct approach is to just follow the available directions step by step until the target is found. Since the first move is west, I should go west first. Then, whatever room I enter next, I check if it's the Utility room. If not, look at available directions again. But the user hasn't given the next steps, so I can only answer the first instruction. The first question is asking what to do now. So the answer is GO: west. Then the next step would depend on where that leads. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details, I can only answer the first move. So the correct answer here is to go west.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: west\n\n <sep> human:<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
