	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Utility room. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Utility room, and I'm starting in the Home theater. The available direction here is west. So I need to go west to move to the neighboring room. The example shows that when you reach the target room, you say DONE. So first step is to go west from Home theater. Let me check if there's any other info. The user hasn't provided the layout of the house, so I have to assume that moving west from Home theater leads to another room, maybe the Utility room? But I don't know. The example had the user moving through several rooms until they found the target. So maybe the correct approach is to just follow the available directions step by step until the target is found. Since the first move is west, I should go west first. Then, whatever room I enter next, I check if it's the Utility room. If not, look at available directions again. But the user hasn't given the next steps, so I can only answer the first instruction. The first question is asking what to do now. So the answer is GO: west. Then the next step would depend on where that leads. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details, I can only answer the first move. So the correct answer here is to go west.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
