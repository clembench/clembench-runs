I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nSince the Exercise room is connected to the Game room via west, maybe going west will take me there. But wait, I should check if the Exercise room's west direction leads directly to the Game room. If the available directions are only west, then that's the only option. So the next step is to go west. If that's correct, then entering the west direction should lead to the Game room. Let me confirm: the user says once the target is found, answer DONE. So if I go west and end up in the Game room, then DONE. Otherwise, maybe I need to explore other directions. But in this case, the available directions are only west. So the only possible move is west. Therefore, the answer should be GO: west. Then, if that's the Game room, DONE. If not, maybe there's a mistake. But according to the problem setup, the user will provide the current room and directions. So assuming that going west from Exercise room leads to the target, but maybe not. Wait, the user hasn't told me where west leads. Wait, the problem says \"You are in the Exercise room. Currently available directions: west.\" So the available directions are west. So the only possible move is west. So the next instruction is to go",
