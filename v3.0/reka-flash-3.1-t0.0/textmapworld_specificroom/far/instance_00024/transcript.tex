	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Cellar. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Cellar, and I'm starting in the Closet. The available direction here is east. So I need to go east from the Closet. But I don't know where that leads yet. The goal is to reach the Cellar. Since I don't have any prior information about the layout, I have to explore step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should move east from the Closet. Let's say I go east, and then I'm in another room. From there, I need to check the available directions again. Maybe there's a path that leads towards the Cellar. But how do I know which direction to take? Since the Cellar is the target, perhaps it's in a specific part of the house. For example, cellars are often underground, so maybe south or east? But that's just a guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given in the problem shows that the user moves west, then north, etc., until they reach the target. So maybe the Cellar is in a direction that requires moving through certain rooms. Since I'm in the Closet and can only go east, I have to go east first. Let's proceed with that. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since I don't have any information about the map, I have to keep moving in a way that explores possible paths. Maybe a depth-first search
