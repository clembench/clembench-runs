Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Cellar. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

But I don't know where that leads yet. The goal is to reach the Cellar. Since I don't have any prior information about the layout, I have to explore step by step.\n\nFirst, I should move east from the Closet. Let's say I go east, and then I'm in another room. From there, I need to check the available directions again. Maybe there's a path that leads towards the Cellar. But how do I know which direction to take? Since the Cellar is the target, perhaps it's in a specific part of the house. For example, cellars are often underground, so maybe south or east? But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem shows that the user moves west, then north, etc., until they reach the target. So maybe the Cellar is in a direction that requires moving through certain rooms. Since I'm in the Closet and can only go east, I have to go east first. Let's proceed with that. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since I don't have any information about the map, I have to keep moving in a way that explores possible paths. Maybe a depth-first search",
