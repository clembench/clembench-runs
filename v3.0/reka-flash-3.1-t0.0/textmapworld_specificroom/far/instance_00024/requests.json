What is your next instruction?\n <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nThe target room is the Cellar, and I'm starting in the Closet. The available direction here is east. So I need to go east from the Closet. But I don't know where that leads yet. The goal is to reach the Cellar. Since I don't have any prior information about the layout, I have to explore step by step.\n\nFirst, I should move east from the Closet. Let's say I go east, and then I'm in another room. From there, I need to check the available directions again. Maybe there's a path that leads towards the Cellar. But how do I know which direction to take? Since the Cellar is the target, perhaps it's in a specific part of the house. For example, cellars are often underground, so maybe south or east? But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem shows that the user moves west, then north, etc., until they reach the target. So maybe the Cellar is in a direction that requires moving through certain rooms. Since I'm in the Closet and can only go east, I have to go east first. Let's proceed with that. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since I don't have any information about the map, I have to keep moving in a way that explores possible paths. Maybe a depth-first search",
