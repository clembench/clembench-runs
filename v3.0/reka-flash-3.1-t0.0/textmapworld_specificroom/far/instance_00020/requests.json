Let's say I go west. If that leads me closer to the Game room, great. If not, I can backtrack. Alternatively, going east might be another path. But without knowing the map, it's random. Wait, maybe there's a strategy here. Since the example used a path like Kitchen -> Lobby -> Bedroom, perhaps the Game room is in a different branch. But I don't know. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Game room is adjacent to the Home gym? If so, then entering either west or east might lead there. But the problem states that the target is the Game room, so I need to reach it. Since I can't check both directions immediately, I have to choose one. Let's pick west first. If that's not the Game room, then I can go back east to the Home gym and try east. But the user wants me to give the next instruction. So I should choose either west or east. Let's go with west.
