	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is Solarium. I'm in the Bathroom, and the only available direction is east. So I need to go east from the Bathroom. The example shows that when you reach the target room, you say DONE. So first, I should move east. Let me check if there's any other info. The user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms, so I have to assume that moving east from the Bathroom might lead towards the Solarium. Since there's only one direction available, I have to go east. Once I enter the next room, if it's the Solarium, then DONE. Otherwise, continue. But the first step is to go east. So the answer should be GO: east.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
