I'm in the Bathroom, and the only available direction is east. So I need to go east from the Bathroom. The example shows that when you reach the target room, you say DONE. So first, I should move east. Let me check if there's any other info. The user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms, so I have to assume that moving east from the Bathroom might lead towards the Solarium. Since there's only one direction available, I have to go east. Once I enter the next room, if it's the Solarium, then DONE. Otherwise, continue. But the first step is to go east.
