Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

The example shows that when you reach the target room, you say DONE. So first, I should move east. Let me check if there's any other info. The user hasn't provided the layout of the rooms, so I have to assume that moving east from the Bathroom might lead towards the Solarium. Since there's only one direction available, I have to go east. Once I enter the next room, if it's the Solarium, then DONE. Otherwise, continue. But the first step is to go east. So the answer should be GO: east.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: east\n\n <sep> human:",
