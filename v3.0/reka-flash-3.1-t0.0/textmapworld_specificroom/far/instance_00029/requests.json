Since the user hasn't provided any map, I have to make educated guesses based on the available directions each time.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem shows that the user moves west from the Kitchen to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom. So maybe the path is linear. But in this case, starting from Balcony, directions are north, south, west. Let's think: maybe the Laundry room is in one of these directions.
