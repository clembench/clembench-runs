	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Laundry room. You are in the Balcony. Currently available directions: north, south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Laundry room, and I'm starting in the Balcony. The available directions here are north, south, and west. I need to figure out which direction to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I should probably explore systematically. Maybe start by going north first. But wait, why north? Maybe there's a pattern or common sense about room placements. Like, sometimes bathrooms or laundry rooms are on certain floors or sides of a house. But since this is a fictional scenario, maybe I shouldn't rely on real-world assumptions.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, I can just pick a direction and proceed. Let's see. The options are north, south, west. Let's pick north. If that doesn't lead to the Laundry room, then I can backtrack. But how do I know if I'm going in the right direction? Since the user hasn't provided any map, I have to make educated guesses based on the available directions each time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given in the problem shows that the user moves west from the Kitchen to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom. So maybe the path is linear. But in this case, starting from Balcony, directions are north, south, west. Let's think: maybe the Laundry room is in one of these directions. Since I don't have any info, I need to try each direction. But which one first?\\ \tt \\ \tt Perhaps the best approach is to
