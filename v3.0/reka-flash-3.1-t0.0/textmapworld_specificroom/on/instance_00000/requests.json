The problem says once we find the target room, we should answer with \"DONE\". So right now, I'm in the target room. The user is asking for the next instruction. Since I'm already there, the correct response is DONE. Let me check the example again. In the example, when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they said DONE. So same here. I don't need to move anywhere else.
