Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Home gym. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?\n",

In the example, when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they said DONE. So same here. I don't need to move anywhere else. Just say DONE.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:",
