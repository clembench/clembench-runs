	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Bathroom, and I'm already in the Bathroom. The problem says once we find the target room, we should answer with "DONE". So in this case, since I'm already in the Bathroom, the task is complete. I just need to check the instructions again to make sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user provided an example where when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they answered DONE. So applying that here, since I'm already in the Bathroom, the correct response is DONE. The available directions don't matter here because the target is already found. I shouldn't move anywhere else. Just need to confirm that the target is indeed the current room. Yep, the problem states "The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom." So DONE is the right move.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
