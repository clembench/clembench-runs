Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

I just need to check the instructions again to make sure.\n\nThe user provided an example where when they entered the Bedroom (the target), they answered DONE. So applying that here, since I'm already in the Bathroom, the correct response is DONE. The available directions don't matter here because the target is already found. I shouldn't move anywhere else. Just need to confirm that the target is indeed the current room. Yep, the problem states \"The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom.\" So DONE is the right move.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:",
