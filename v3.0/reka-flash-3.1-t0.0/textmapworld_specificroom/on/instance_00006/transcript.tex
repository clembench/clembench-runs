	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Bathroom, and I'm already in the Bathroom. The problem says once we find the target room, we should answer with "DONE". So if I'm already in the target room, the task is complete. Let me check the example again to make sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt In the example, they started in the Kitchen, moved to Lobby, then to Bedroom, and then said DONE. So the moment you enter the target room, you stop. Here, the user is already in the Bathroom, which is the target. So the correct response is DONE. I don't need to move anywhere else. Just need to confirm that being in the target room means the task is done. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be DONE.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
