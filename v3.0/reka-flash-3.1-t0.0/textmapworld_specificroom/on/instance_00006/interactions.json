Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n",

So if I'm already in the target room, the task is complete. Let me check the example again to make sure.\n\nIn the example, they started in the Kitchen, moved to Lobby, then to Bedroom, and then said DONE. So the moment you enter the target room, you stop. Here, the user is already in the Bathroom, which is the target. So the correct response is DONE. I don't need to move anywhere else. Just need to confirm that being in the target room means the task is done. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be DONE.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:",
