The problem says once we find the target room, we should answer with \"DONE\". So if I'm already in the target room, the task is complete. Let me check the example again to make sure.\n\nIn the example, they started in the Kitchen, moved to Lobby, then to Bedroom, and then said DONE. So the moment you enter the target room, you stop. Here, the user is already in the Bathroom, which is the target. So the correct response is DONE. I don't need to move anywhere else. Just need to confirm that being in the target room means the task is done. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be DONE.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:<|endoftext|>",
