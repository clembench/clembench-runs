So the first thing here is that the current room is the target. So the answer should be DONE immediately. Let me check the example again. In the example, when they entered the Bedroom, which was the target, they said DONE. So here, since I'm already in the Game room, the correct response is DONE. The available directions don't matter because the target is already found.
