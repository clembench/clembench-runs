	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Game room. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: north, west, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Game room, and I'm already in it. The user said once we find the target room, we should answer with "DONE". So the first thing here is that the current room is the target. So the answer should be DONE immediately. Let me check the example again. In the example, when they entered the Bedroom, which was the target, they said DONE. So here, since I'm already in the Game room, the correct response is DONE. The available directions don't matter because the target is already found. So the answer is DONE.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
