	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Craft room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Craft room, and I'm already in it. The user said once we find the target room, we should answer with "DONE". So even though I'm already here, I need to check if that's the case.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem statement says: "once we have found the target room, answer with DONE instead." So if I'm already in the Craft room, which is the target, then the correct response is DONE. But let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding the setup.\\ \tt \\ \tt The initial message says: "The target room is Craft room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?" So the user is starting in the target room. But according to the example, when you enter the target room, you say DONE. Wait, in the example, the user enters the Bedroom (target) and then says DONE. So in this case, since I'm already in the target room, the answer should be DONE immediately. But maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps the setup is that the target is somewhere else, but the initial position is the Craft room. Wait, the problem says "the target room is Craft room. You are in the Craft room." So that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the user made a typo? Or perhaps the target is different? Wait, let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user wrote: "The target room is Craft room. You are in
