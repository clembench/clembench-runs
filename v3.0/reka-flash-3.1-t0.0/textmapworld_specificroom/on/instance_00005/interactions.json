Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Study room. You are in the Study room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?\n",

The example shows that when they enter the Bedroom (the target), they respond with DONE. So in this case, since I'm already in the Study room, which is the target, the correct action is to say DONE immediately. The available directions here are north and west, but since the target is already found, I don't need to move anymore. So the answer should be DONE.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:",
