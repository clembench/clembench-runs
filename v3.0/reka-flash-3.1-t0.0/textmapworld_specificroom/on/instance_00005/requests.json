The example shows that when they enter the Bedroom (the target), they respond with DONE. So in this case, since I'm already in the Study room, which is the target, the correct action is to say DONE immediately. The available directions here are north and west, but since the target is already found, I don't need to move anymore. So the answer should be DONE.\n</reasoning>\n\nDONE\n\n <sep> human:<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
