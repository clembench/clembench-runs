	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Exercise room. You are in the Exercise room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Exercise room, and I'm already in it. The user says, "You are in the Exercise room." So the goal is to find the target room, which is the Exercise room. But if I'm already there, then the task is done. The instructions say once the target is found, answer with "DONE". So in this case, since I'm already in the target room, I should just say DONE. The available directions here are west, but that's irrelevant because the target is already achieved. So the correct response is DONE.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
