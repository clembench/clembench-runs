So even though I'm already here, I need to check if that's the case.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"once we have found the target room, answer with DONE instead.\" So if I'm already in the Craft room, which is the target, then the correct response is DONE. But let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding. The initial message says, \"You are in the Craft room.\" So the target is Craft room, and I'm already there. Therefore, the next instruction should be DONE. \n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Let me read the example again. In the example, the target was Bedroom, and when they entered it, they said DONE. So same logic applies here. Since I'm already in the target room, the answer is DONE. No need to move anywhere else.
