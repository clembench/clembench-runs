	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Sauna. You are in the Balcony. Currently available directions: north, south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is Sauna, and I'm starting in the Balcony. The available directions are north, south, and west. I need to figure out which direction to go first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I should probably explore systematically. Maybe start by going north first. But wait, why north? Maybe there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the Sauna is commonly located in a certain area of a house. For example, in some houses, the sauna might be near the bathroom or in a more secluded area. But without specific info, I can't be sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe I should try all directions. But since the user wants me to give one instruction at a time, I need to pick one. Let's think: Balcony. If I go north, maybe that leads to another area. South might be towards the entrance or main living area. West could be a different wing. But again, this is all guesswork.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given in the problem had the user go west first. Maybe the strategy is to pick a direction and proceed. Since the example went west, maybe that's a common approach. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the Sauna is in a specific direction relative to the Balcony. But without a map, it's random.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, perhaps the Sauna is in a room that's not too far. Let's say I
