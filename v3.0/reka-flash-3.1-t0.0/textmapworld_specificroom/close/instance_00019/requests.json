I need to figure out which direction to go first.\n\nHmm, since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I should probably explore systematically. Maybe start by going north first. But wait, why north? Maybe there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the Sauna is commonly located in a certain area of a house. For example, in some houses, the sauna might be near the bathroom or in a more secluded area. But without specific info, I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try all directions. But since the user wants me to give one instruction at a time, I need to pick one. Let's think: Balcony. If I go north, maybe that leads to another area. South might be towards the entrance or main living area. West could be a different wing. But again, this is all guesswork.\n\nWait, the example given in the problem had the user go west first. Maybe the strategy is to pick a direction and proceed. Since the example went west, maybe that's a common approach. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the Sauna is in a specific direction relative to the Balcony. But without a map, it's random.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Sauna is in a room that's not too far. Let's say I",
