Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Dining room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by moving east since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving east will lead me closer to the Dining room? Maybe the layout of the rooms is such that east from the Craft room is a common path towards the Dining area. Alternatively, maybe the Craft room is connected to other rooms, and east is a possible route. Since there's no other direction, I have to go east. Let's assume that moving east is the right choice here. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then, I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details yet, I just need to give the initial move. So the answer should be GO: east. If that leads to the Dining room, then DONE. Otherwise, continue exploring. But based on the current info, east is the only option. So the first step is to go east.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: east\n\n <sep> human:",
