I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by moving east since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving east will lead me closer to the Dining room? Maybe the layout of the rooms is such that east from the Craft room is a common path towards the Dining area. Alternatively, maybe the Craft room is connected to other rooms, and east is a possible route. Since there's no other direction, I have to go east. Let's assume that moving east is the right choice here. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then, I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details yet, I just need to give the initial move. So the answer should be GO: east. If that leads to the Dining room, then DONE. Otherwise, continue exploring. But based on the current info, east is the only option.
