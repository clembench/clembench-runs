	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Dining room. You are in the Craft room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Dining room, and I'm currently in the Craft room. The available direction here is east. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably start by moving east since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving east will lead me closer to the Dining room? Maybe the layout of the rooms is such that east from the Craft room is a common path towards the Dining area. Alternatively, maybe the Craft room is connected to other rooms, and east is a possible route. Since there's no other direction, I have to go east. Let's assume that moving east is the right choice here. Once I move east, I'll be in a new room. Then, I can check the available directions there and decide the next move. But since the user hasn't provided the next room's details yet, I just need to give the initial move. So the answer should be GO: east. If that leads to the Dining room, then DONE. Otherwise, continue exploring. But based on the current info, east is the only option. So the first step is to go east.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
