	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Guest room. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Guest room, and I'm currently in the Home gym. The available directions are west and east. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably try to explore the map step by step. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, maybe I should pick one direction and go that way. Let's say I choose west. If I go west from the Home gym, where would that take me? Maybe to another room like a Living room or something. Alternatively, east might lead to another area. But without knowing the map, it's a bit random.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but maybe there's a strategy here. Since the target is the Guest room, perhaps it's located in a specific part of the house. Typically, guest rooms are often near common areas like the living room or maybe on a different floor. But since this is a 2D map, maybe the layout is a simple grid. Let me think: Home gym is a room, and from there, west and east are options. Let's assume that going west might lead towards the front of the house, and east towards the back. But this is just a guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe I should try to map out the rooms as I go. For example, if I go west from Home gym, I enter a new room, say a Living room. Then from there, I can note the available directions and plan a path. But
