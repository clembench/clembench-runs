I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to explore the map step by step. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, maybe I should pick one direction and go that way. Let's say I choose west. If I go west from the Home gym, where would that take me? Maybe to another room like a Living room or something. Alternatively, east might lead to another area. But without knowing the map, it's a bit random.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a strategy here. Since the target is the Guest room, perhaps it's located in a specific part of the house. Typically, guest rooms are often near common areas like the living room or maybe on a different floor. But since this is a 2D map, maybe the layout is a simple grid. Let me think: Home gym is a room, and from there, west and east are options. Let's assume that going west might lead towards the front of the house, and east towards the back. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to map out the rooms as I go. For example, if I go west from Home gym, I enter a new room, say a Living room. Then from there, I can note the available directions and plan a path. But",
