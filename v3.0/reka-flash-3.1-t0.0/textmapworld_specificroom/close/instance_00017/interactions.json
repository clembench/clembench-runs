Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Exercise room. You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by moving west since that's the only option available right now. But wait, how do I know if moving west will lead me closer to the Exercise room? Maybe the layout of the house isn't provided, so I have to make educated guesses based on typical house layouts.\n\nIn many homes, the Home theater is often located in a more isolated area, maybe near other entertainment rooms. The Exercise room is usually a standalone room, perhaps near the entrance or in a different wing. If I go west from the Home theater, maybe that leads to a hallway or another area. Let's say moving west takes me to a hallway. From there, maybe there are more directions to explore. But since I don't have the map, I have to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Exercise room is in the west direction from the Home theater. But since the user hasn't provided any prior information, I can't be sure. The best approach is to follow the available directions and explore each room one by one, keeping track of visited rooms to avoid loops. But since the user hasn't mentioned tracking, I'll just proceed with the given directions.\n\nSo, the only available direction is west. I should go west first. Let's assume that moving west from Home theater leads",
