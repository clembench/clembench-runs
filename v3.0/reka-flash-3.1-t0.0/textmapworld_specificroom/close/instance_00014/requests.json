I need to figure out which direction to go first.\n\nHmm, since I don't have any prior information about the layout of the rooms, I might have to explore randomly. But maybe there's a strategy here. Like, maybe choosing a direction that hasn't been tried yet? Wait, but in this case, it's the first move, so all directions are new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to pick one direction and proceed step by step. Let's see. The options are north, west, east. Let me think about possible paths. If I go north from the Game room, maybe that leads to another room. Let's say I go north first. Then, from there, I can check the available directions again. But without knowing the map, it's a bit of a guess.\n\nWait, but maybe the example given can help. In the example, they went west first from the Kitchen to the Lobby. So maybe the strategy is to pick a direction and keep moving in that direction until a dead end, then backtrack. But that's a common maze-solving strategy. However, since the target is a specific room (Studio), maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rooms are connected in a way that the Studio is in a certain area. But without knowing the layout, it's hard to say.",
