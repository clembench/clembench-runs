Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Exercise room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\n",

So I need to decide whether to go west or not.\n\nFirst, I should think about how the rooms are connected. Since the Exercise room is connected to the west, moving west would take me to another room. But I don't know what that room is yet. The goal is to reach the Bathroom, so I need to explore the neighboring rooms step by step.\n\nSince there's only one direction available (west), I have to go there. Maybe the room west of the Exercise room is a common area, like a Living Room, or perhaps it's another exercise area? But without knowing, I have to proceed. The key is to keep moving in directions until I find the Bathroom.\n\nSo the next move should be to go west. Once I enter that room, I can check its name and available directions. If it's not the Bathroom, I'll continue exploring from there. If it is, then I answer DONE. But right now, since I'm in the Exercise room and the only option is west, I have to choose that direction.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: west\n\n <sep> human:",
