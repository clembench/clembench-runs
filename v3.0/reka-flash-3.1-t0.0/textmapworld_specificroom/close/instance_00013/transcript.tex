	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Bathroom. You are in the Exercise room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Bathroom, and I'm currently in the Exercise room. The available direction here is west. So I need to decide whether to go west or not.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should think about how the rooms are connected. Since the Exercise room is connected to the west, moving west would take me to another room. But I don't know what that room is yet. The goal is to reach the Bathroom, so I need to explore the neighboring rooms step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Since there's only one direction available (west), I have to go there. Maybe the room west of the Exercise room is a common area, like a Living Room, or perhaps it's another exercise area? But without knowing, I have to proceed. The key is to keep moving in directions until I find the Bathroom.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the next move should be to go west. Once I enter that room, I can check its name and available directions. If it's not the Bathroom, I'll continue exploring from there. If it is, then I answer DONE. But right now, since I'm in the Exercise room and the only option is west, I have to choose that direction.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
