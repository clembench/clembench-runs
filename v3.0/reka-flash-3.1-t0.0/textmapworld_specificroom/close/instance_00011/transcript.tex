	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Exercise room. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is the Exercise room, and I'm starting in the Bathroom. The available direction here is east. So I need to go east from the Bathroom. But I don't know where that leads yet. The goal is to reach the Exercise room, so I should follow the directions given each time. Since the user hasn't provided any prior steps, I just need to choose the available direction. The example shows that when there's only one direction, you go that way. So in this case, the only option is east. So the answer should be GO: east. Then, whatever room I enter next, I'll have to check the available directions again. But since the target hasn't been found yet, I just keep moving. Once I reach the Exercise room, then I answer DONE. So first step is definitely east.\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt GO: east\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
