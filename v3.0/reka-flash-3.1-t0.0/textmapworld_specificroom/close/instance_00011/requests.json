So I need to go east from the Bathroom. But I don't know where that leads yet. The goal is to reach the Exercise room, so I should follow the directions given each time. Since the user hasn't provided any prior steps, I just need to choose the available direction. The example shows that when there's only one direction, you go that way. So in this case, the only option is east. So the answer should be GO: east. Then, whatever room I enter next, I'll have to check the available directions again. But since the target hasn't been found yet, I just keep moving. Once I reach the Exercise room, then I answer DONE.
