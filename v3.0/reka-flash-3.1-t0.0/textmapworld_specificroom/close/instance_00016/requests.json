I'm in the Bathroom. The available directions are south and west. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to explore the map step by step. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I'll have to make educated guesses. Maybe start by choosing one direction and see where it leads. Let's say I go south first. If that leads to a room that's closer to the Solarium, great. If not, I can backtrack west. Alternatively, going west might take me somewhere else. \n\nWait, but how do I know which direction is better? Without a map, it's random. Maybe I should just pick one direction and proceed. Let's go with south. So the instruction would be GO: south. Then, depending on where that takes me, I can continue exploring. If I end up in a room that's adjacent to the Solarium, then I can adjust. But since the Solarium is the target, maybe I need to look for clues in the room descriptions. Wait, the problem doesn't mention room descriptions beyond the name. So maybe each room's name can give a hint. For example, if I go south from Bathroom and enter a Living Room, maybe that's a common path. But I don't know if that's leading towards Solarium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Solarium is typically located in a certain part of a",
