	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find the target room. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. The target room is Solarium. You are in the Bathroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt The target room is Solarium. I'm in the Bathroom. The available directions are south and west. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably try to explore the map step by step. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I'll have to make educated guesses. Maybe start by choosing one direction and see where it leads. Let's say I go south first. If that leads to a room that's closer to the Solarium, great. If not, I can backtrack west. Alternatively, going west might take me somewhere else. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but how do I know which direction is better? Without a map, it's random. Maybe I should just pick one direction and proceed. Let's go with south. So the instruction would be GO: south. Then, depending on where that takes me, I can continue exploring. If I end up in a room that's adjacent to the Solarium, then I can adjust. But since the Solarium is the target, maybe I need to look for clues in the room descriptions. Wait, the problem doesn't mention room descriptions beyond the name. So maybe each room's name can give a hint. For example, if I go south from Bathroom and enter a Living Room, maybe that's a common path. But I don't know if that's leading towards Solarium. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the Solarium is typically located in a certain part of a
