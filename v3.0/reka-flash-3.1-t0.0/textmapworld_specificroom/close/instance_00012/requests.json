What is your next instruction?\n <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nThe target room is the Exercise room, and I'm currently in the Craft room. The available direction here is west. I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by moving west since that's the only option available. But wait, how do I know if moving west will lead me closer to the Exercise room? Without a map, it's a bit of a guess. Maybe the Exercise room is in a different part of the house. Let's think about typical house layouts. Craft rooms are often in areas like basements or maybe near other hobby rooms. Exercise rooms are usually in more central or accessible areas, maybe near living spaces or gyms. \n\nIf I'm in the Craft room and can go west, maybe that direction leads to another room connected to the Exercise area. Alternatively, maybe west leads to a dead end or a different part of the house. Since there's no other direction, I have to choose west. Let's go with that. So the instruction would be GO: west. Then, whatever room I enter next, I'll have to check the available directions again and repeat the process until I find the Exercise room. If I end up in a room that's not the target, I'll have to choose another direction. But since the first move is forced to west, that's the only option here. So the answer should be GO: west.\n</reasoning>\n\nGO: west\n\n <sep>",
