Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nThe target room is a Bedroom. You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. The target room is Foyer. You are in the Study room. Currently available directions: north, west. What is your next instruction?\n",

I need to figure out which direction to go next.\n\nFirst, I should probably try to explore the map step by step. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of the layout, I'll have to make educated guesses. Maybe I can start by moving in one direction and see where that leads. Let's say I go north first. If that leads me closer to the Foyer, great. If not, I can backtrack west. Alternatively, going west might take me somewhere else. \n\nWait, but how do I know which direction is better? Without a map, it's a bit random. Maybe I should try one direction, then if I don't find the Foyer, try the other. Let's pick north. So the instruction would be GO: north. Then, depending on where that takes me, I can continue. If I end up in a room that's not the Foyer, I'll check the available directions again and proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or common layouts. For example, in many house layouts, the Foyer is often near the entrance, which might be connected to the Study via certain directions. But I'm not sure. Since the example given in the problem had the target room (Bedroom) being found by moving west then north, maybe similar logic applies here. \n\nWait,",
