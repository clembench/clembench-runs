In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least steps. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem. The key here is to explore the rooms in such a way that we don't get stuck in a loop and can cover all nodes (rooms) with the minimal number of moves.\n\nFirst, I remember that Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are common approaches. BFS is typically used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which might be useful here since each move is a step. However, since the problem allows us to choose directions each time, maybe a BFS approach would help in exploring all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path. But wait, the problem isn't exactly about finding the shortest path between two points, but rather visiting all rooms with the fewest room changes. So maybe it's more about finding the shortest possible route that covers all rooms, which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but TSP is NP-hard. However, given that the maze might be small, perhaps a backtracking approach with BFS could work.\n\nAlternatively, since the user is making decisions step by step, maybe a greedy approach would be better here. The user needs to input directions each time, so the assistant has",
