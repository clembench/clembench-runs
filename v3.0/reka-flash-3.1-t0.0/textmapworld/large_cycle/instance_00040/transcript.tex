	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: north, south, west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out a path that covers every room in the maze with the least number of moves. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with whatever information is given step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Utility room. The available directions are north, south, west, east. So, four exits. The challenge is to explore all rooms with minimal steps. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, specifically a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which ensures the shortest path. But since I don't have the entire map, I need to build it as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user is asking for a step-by-step decision. So each time I choose a direction, I move to a new room, and then I need to decide the next move based on the current room's available directions. The key is to avoid cycles and backtrack only when necessary. But how to track visited rooms? Since the user doesn't provide a map, I need to keep track of the rooms I've already visited. Let's see.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me start by choosing a direction. Since all directions are available, maybe pick one and go. Let's say I go north first. Then, from the new room, check available directions. But I need to make sure
