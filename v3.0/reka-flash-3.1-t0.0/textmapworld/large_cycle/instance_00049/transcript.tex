	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sunroom. Currently available directions: north, south, west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest room changes possible. The user starts in the Sunroom, which has directions north, south, and west available. The goal is to explore all rooms by moving through them, choosing directions each time, and stopping when there are no new rooms left.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I should probably start by mapping out the rooms as I go. But since I don't have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms to avoid revisiting them. The challenge is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is NP-hard, so maybe a greedy approach would work here, like always choosing the nearest unvisited room.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the user is asking for the fewest room changes (i.e., steps), each move counts as a step. So the strategy should be to explore in a way that minimizes backtracking. Maybe using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, but DFS can lead to longer paths if not careful. Alternatively, breadth-first search (BFS) might help find the shortest path, but since we need to visit all rooms, BFS might not directly apply here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem isn't to find the shortest path between two points, but to visit all rooms with the few
