I need to figure out the best way to visit all the rooms with the fewest room changes possible. The user starts in the Sunroom, which has directions north, south, and west available. The goal is to explore all rooms by moving through them, choosing directions each time, and stopping when there are no new rooms left.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by mapping out the rooms as I go. But since I don't have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms to avoid revisiting them. The challenge is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is NP-hard, so maybe a greedy approach would work here, like always choosing the nearest unvisited room.\n\nBut since the user is asking for the fewest room changes (i.e., steps), each move counts as a step. So the strategy should be to explore in a way that minimizes backtracking. Maybe using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, but DFS can lead to longer paths if not careful. Alternatively, breadth-first search (BFS) might help find the shortest path, but since we need to visit all rooms, BFS might not directly apply here.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't to find the shortest path between two points, but to visit all rooms with the few",
