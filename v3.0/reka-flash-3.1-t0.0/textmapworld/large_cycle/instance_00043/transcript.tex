	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Dining room, and the available direction is west. So the first move is probably west. But wait, maybe there's a way to explore other directions first? But since the initial available direction is only west, I have to go there. Let's assume that each room has some connected rooms, and we need to map them out.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Room changes mean moving from one room to another, right? So each "GO" command is a room change. So the total number of "GO" commands needed is the number of room changes. So the goal is to minimize the number of GO commands to visit all rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt This sounds like a graph traversal problem. Each room is a node, and each direction is an edge. We need to find the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so for a small number of rooms, maybe we can find a path manually.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the actual layout isn't given, we have to figure it out as we go. So the challenge is to explore the rooms in such a way
