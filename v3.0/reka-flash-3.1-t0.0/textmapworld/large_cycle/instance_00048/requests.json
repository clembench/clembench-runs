To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Game room, and available directions are south and west. The challenge is to decide which direction to go first. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, I need to explore in a way that covers all rooms efficiently. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path. But since we don't know the entire map upfront, it's more like an adaptive BFS where we explore as we go.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So the objective is to visit every room in the least number of moves. That's the classic shortest path problem for covering all nodes in a graph, which is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is NP-hard, but maybe the room layout is a simple grid, so there's a systematic way to traverse it.\n\nBut since the user is simulating",
