        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Laundry room. Currently available directions: north, south, west. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>Let&#x27;s see. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know how many rooms there are? The example shows moving through a few rooms, but the actual problem might have more. Since the user hasn&#x27;t provided a map, I have to assume that the available directions change as we move through rooms, and we need to explore efficiently.<br/><br/>First, the starting point is the Laundry room with directions north, south, west. The challenge is to decide which direction to go first. Since the goal is minimal room changes, maybe a depth-first approach isn&#x27;t the best because that can lead to backtracking. Breadth-first might be better to explore all possibilities level by level. But without knowing the layout, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says &quot;visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.&quot; So each move to a neighboring room counts as a room change. So the total number of moves needed to visit all rooms is the number of room changes. So the minimal path would be the shortest possible path that covers all rooms. That sounds like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since this is a maze-like structure, maybe there&#x27;s a way to find a Hamiltonian path with minimal steps.<br/><br/>But how to approach this without knowing the map? The user</p>
