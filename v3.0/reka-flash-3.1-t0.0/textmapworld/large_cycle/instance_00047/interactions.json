In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Game room, and the only available direction is east. So the first move has to be east. Let me note that down. When I move east, I'll enter whatever room is there. Let's say that's Room A. But since I don't have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken.\n\nWait, but the problem says to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Room changes probably refer to the number of moves, right? Each time I go from one room to another, that's a room change. So the objective is to minimize the total number of moves to visit all rooms. That sounds like finding the shortest possible path that covers all rooms, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe there's a way to approach this greedily or using backtracking as we explore.\n\nBut since the user is expecting a step-by-step answer, I need to make decisions based on the available directions each time, keeping",
