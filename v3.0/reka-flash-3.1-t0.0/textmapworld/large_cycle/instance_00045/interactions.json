In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably similar to finding the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But since the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure, maybe there's a specific path that allows covering all rooms with minimal steps.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph where each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions (north, south, etc.). The challenge is to find the shortest path that visits every node at least once. However, TSP is NP-hard, which means finding the exact solution might be computationally intensive, especially if the number of rooms is large. But since this is a text-based scenario, maybe the number of rooms isn't too big, so a systematic approach could work.\n\nThe user starts in the Game room with directions north, west, and east. Each move goes to a neighboring room, and we need to track visited rooms to avoid cycles. The key is to explore in a way that minimizes backtracking. Maybe a depth-first search (DFS) approach, but with backtracking when necessary. Alternatively, breadth-first search (BFS) could help find the shortest path, but since we need to visit all rooms, BFS",
