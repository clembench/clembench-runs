You are in the Game room. Currently available directions: north, west, east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably similar to finding the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But since the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure, maybe there's a specific path that allows covering all rooms with minimal steps.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph where each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions (north, south, etc.). The challenge is to find the shortest path that visits every node at least once. However, TSP is NP-hard, which means finding the exact solution might be computationally intensive, especially if the number of rooms is large. But since this is a text-based scenario, maybe the number of rooms isn't too big, so a systematic approach could work.\n\nThe user starts in the Game room with directions north, west, and east. Each move goes to a neighboring room, and we need to track visited rooms to avoid cycles. The key is to explore in a way that minimizes backtracking. Maybe a depth-first search (DFS) approach, but with backtracking when necessary. Alternatively, breadth-first search (BFS) could help find the shortest path, but since we need to visit all rooms, BFS",
