In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The example given starts in the Kitchen and moves west to the Lobby, then north, etc. But in the actual problem, the user starts in the Craft room with available directions north and west.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided the entire map. So maybe this is part of an interactive problem where each step reveals new rooms and their directions. The challenge is to navigate through the rooms, keeping track of visited ones to avoid cycles, and find the shortest path to visit all rooms. But since the problem is presented step by step, perhaps each time the user provides the current room and available directions, I have to decide the next move.\n\nBut how do I know when all rooms are visited? The user mentions recognizing when there are no new rooms to visit. So maybe once all rooms have been explored, the process stops. But how do I track which rooms have been visited? Since the assistant doesn't have memory of previous steps unless the user provides it, but in the example, the assistant seems to know the path. Wait, in the example, the assistant gives a sequence of moves that eventually leads to DONE. But in reality, each step is a response to the current state provided by the user",
