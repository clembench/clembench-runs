	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Cellar. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the starting point is the Cellar, and the only available direction is east. So the first move has to be east. Let's say I go east into another room. Wait, but I don't know what that room is called or its available directions. The example shows that each step gives the current room and available directions. So I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken to avoid cycles.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem says "visit all the rooms" but doesn't specify how many there are. So maybe the rooms are connected in a way that requires exploring each possible path until all are visited. But how do I know when all are visited? The user mentions recognizing when there are no new rooms to visit. So perhaps when all adjacent rooms have already been visited, then we can stop. But the example ends when there's only one direction left (south) and then DONE is called. Wait, in the example, the Bedroom has only south, but they went south and then DONE? Wait, no, the example shows that after entering
