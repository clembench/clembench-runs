        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Living room. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>Let&#x27;s tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn&#x27;t provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.<br/><br/>First, the starting point is the Living room with available directions west and east. The challenge is to explore all rooms without getting stuck and ensuring that each move leads to unvisited rooms. But since I don&#x27;t have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken. Wait, but the problem says &quot;visit all the rooms,&quot; but how many rooms are there? The example had Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom, etc., but the actual number here isn&#x27;t specified. So maybe the number of rooms is variable, and I need to explore until there are no new rooms left.<br/><br/>The key here is to use a strategy that minimizes backtracking. The most efficient way to explore an unknown maze is typically using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking, but since we want the fewest room changes (i.e., steps), maybe a breadth-first search (BFS) would be better because BFS explores all rooms at the current depth level before moving to the next, which could potentially find the shortest path. However, BFS requires knowing the</p>
