To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Nursery. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nStarting in the Nursery, the available direction is south. So the first move has to be south. Let's say I go south. Then I'll enter another room, maybe a Hallway or something. But I don't know the exact layout. Wait, the example shows that each step reveals the current room and available directions. So each time I move, I get new info about the next room.\n\nThe challenge is to explore all rooms with the fewest steps. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically finding the shortest path that visits all nodes (rooms). The classic solution for that is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but TSP is NP-hard. However, since we're exploring incrementally, maybe a backtracking approach or using BFS to explore all possibilities while keeping track of visited rooms.\n\nBut since the user wants the fewest room changes (i.e., steps), we need to find the shortest possible path that covers all rooms. However, without knowing the entire map upfront, it's tricky. So perhaps we need to use a depth",
