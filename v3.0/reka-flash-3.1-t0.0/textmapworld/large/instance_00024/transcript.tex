	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Bar. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each time I'm in a room, I have to choose a direction to go, and I need to make sure that I don't revisit rooms unnecessarily. Also, once there are no new rooms left to visit, I should stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand the structure of the rooms. Since the example starts in the Kitchen and goes west to the Lobby, then north to another room, etc., it seems like the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure. The challenge is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. This reminds me of the classic "traversal" problem, similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, but here we want the minimal number of steps (room changes) to visit all rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible". So each move to a new room counts as a change. So the goal is to visit all rooms with the least number of moves. That's equivalent to finding the shortest possible path that visits every room at least once. This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. However, since the problem is presented in a maze-like scenario, maybe the structure is such that a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach can be used to find the minimal path.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I model
