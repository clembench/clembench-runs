In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each room has available directions, and I need to choose the direction that leads to unvisited rooms first to minimize backtracking. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably best approached with BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which would ensure the shortest path.\n\nWait, but the user wants the fewest room changes. Each \"GO: DIRECTION\" is a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. That's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since the problem is presented in a maze-like structure where each room is connected to others, maybe it's a grid or a tree-like structure. However, the exact layout isn't given, so I need to make decisions based on the available directions provided step by step.\n\nThe example given starts in the Kitchen, goes west to Lobby, north to Bedroom, then DONE. So the path was Kitchen -> Lobby -> Bedroom. That's three rooms visited with two moves (since each move is a room change). Wait, the example shows three rooms but two GO commands. So each GO is a move to a new room. The task is to visit all rooms with the least number of moves (room",
