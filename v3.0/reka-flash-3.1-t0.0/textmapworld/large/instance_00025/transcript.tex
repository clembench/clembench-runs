	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the starting point is the Pantry with available directions north and south. The challenge is to explore each room without getting stuck and ensuring that all rooms are visited with the minimal number of moves. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is typically used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. But since the goal here is to visit all rooms, it's more like finding the shortest path that covers all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is computationally intensive, especially for larger graphs. But given that this is a text-based problem and the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure, maybe a backtracking approach with BFS could work.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user wants the fewest number of room changes. Each "GO: DIRECTION" is a room change. So, the total number of steps (room changes) should be minimized. To visit all rooms, the minimal number of steps would be (number of rooms - 1),
