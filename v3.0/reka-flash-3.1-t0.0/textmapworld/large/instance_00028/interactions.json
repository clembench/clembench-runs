In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?",

The user starts in the Bedroom with directions west and east available.\n\nFirst, I should probably map out the rooms as I go. But since I don't have the layout, I need to make decisions based on the available directions each time. The key is to avoid backtracking as much as possible to minimize steps. \n\nStarting in the Bedroom. The options are west or east. Let's pick one direction. Let's say I go west first. Wait, but maybe east leads to a more connected area? Hmm. Without knowing the layout, it's tricky. Maybe I should choose a direction and proceed, then see where that leads. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem starts in the Kitchen, goes west to Lobby, then north to Bedroom, then south to Bedroom again? Wait, the example shows that after entering the Bedroom, the available direction is south, and then they do DONE. But maybe the example is just a sample. \n\nIn the current problem, starting in Bedroom with west and east. Let's pick one direction. Let's say west. So the first move is GO: west. Then we enter a new room. Let's say that room has some directions. But since I don't know the layout, maybe I need to explore each branch as much as possible",
