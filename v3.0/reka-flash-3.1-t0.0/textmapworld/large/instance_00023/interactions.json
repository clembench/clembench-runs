In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?",

Each time I'm in a room, I have to choose a direction to go. Once there are no new rooms left to visit, I should stop with DONE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure here. It seems like a graph where each room is a node, and directions are edges connecting them. The challenge is to traverse all nodes (rooms) with the least number of steps (room changes). Wait, but the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" So each time I move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest possible path that visits every room, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe the problem is simpler here, assuming the graph is a tree or has a specific structure.\n\nBut since the user is providing the available directions step by step, it's more like an exploration where I have to make choices that lead to unvisited rooms first, perhaps using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach. However, the goal is to minimize the number of room changes, which is equivalent to minimizing the number of steps. So BFS might be better here because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring the shortest path. But since we need to visit all rooms,",
