	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Attic. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the starting point is the Attic, and the available direction is west. So the first move is probably to go west. But wait, maybe there's a strategy here. Since we want to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, not the number of direction changes. Wait, the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Hmm, maybe "room changes" refers to the number of times you enter a new room. So each time you move to a new room, that's a room change. So the goal is to visit all rooms with the least number of room changes, which would be equivalent to visiting all rooms in the shortest possible path. So it's essentially finding the shortest path that covers all rooms, which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem but in a grid-like structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the rooms are connected in a graph, and we need to traverse all nodes (rooms) with the minimal number of edges (steps). However, the TSP is NP-hard, but maybe
