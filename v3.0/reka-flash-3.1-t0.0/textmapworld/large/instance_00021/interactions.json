In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Gallery. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Gallery, and the only available direction is east. So the first move has to be east. Let me note that down. When I move east, I'll enter whatever room is there. Let's say that's Room A. But since I don't have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms,\" but how many rooms are there? The example had Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom, etc. But without knowing the total number, it's tricky. Maybe the process is to explore until there are no new rooms left. So the algorithm should be similar to a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to ensure all rooms are visited. But since the goal is the fewest room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, BFS might be better because it explores all rooms at the current depth before moving to the next, which could minimize the number of steps.
