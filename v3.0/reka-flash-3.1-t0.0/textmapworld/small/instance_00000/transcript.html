        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Studio. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>Let&#x27;s tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The example starts in the Kitchen, then goes west to Lobby, north, etc. But in the actual problem, the user starts in the Studio with only west available.<br/><br/>Wait, the user hasn&#x27;t provided the full map. So maybe this is a dynamic problem where each step reveals new rooms and directions. The challenge is to navigate through the rooms, keeping track of visited ones to ensure all are covered, while minimizing the number of moves. But since the map isn&#x27;t given upfront, I have to explore step by step, making decisions based on the available directions each time.<br/><br/>The key here is to use a strategy that ensures we don&#x27;t get stuck in a loop and can eventually visit all rooms. The classic approach for such exploration is Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). DFS goes as deep as possible first, which might help in covering new rooms quickly, but could lead to backtracking if we hit a dead end. BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on, which might be better for ensuring all rooms are covered with minimal steps. However, since the goal is the fewest room changes (i.e., steps), BFS could be more</p>
