        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: west<br/>You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?<br/>GO: north<br/>...<br/>You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?<br/>DONE<br/>Let us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction?</p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>Let&#x27;s tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn&#x27;t provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.<br/><br/>First, the starting point is the Closet. Available directions are north and south. I need to decide which direction to go first. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, maybe I should explore one direction fully before backtracking. That&#x27;s a common strategy in maze-solving, like depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). But which one gives the fewest steps? BFS explores all rooms at the present depth level before moving on to rooms further away, which might be better for minimizing steps. However, without knowing the entire layout, it&#x27;s tricky.<br/><br/>Wait, but the problem says &quot;visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.&quot; Room changes are the number of moves, right? So each &quot;GO&quot; command is a room change. So the total number of moves should be minimized. So the optimal path is the shortest possible path that visits every room. That&#x27;s essentially finding the shortest Hamiltonian path through the graph of rooms. But Hamiltonian path is NP-hard, so without knowing the graph structure, it&#x27;s impossible</p>
