In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Kitchen, and available directions are north and south. The example given in the problem shows that the user is making decisions based on the current room and available directions. The challenge is to explore all rooms without getting stuck and ensuring that the path taken is the shortest possible.\n\nWait, but how do I track which rooms I've already visited? Because if I revisit a room, that's not efficient. So maybe I need to keep a mental map or a list of visited rooms. But since the problem doesn't mention any memory beyond the current state, perhaps I need to make decisions based on the current room and directions, without knowing the entire layout. That complicates things because without knowing the full structure, it's hard to plan the shortest path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a depth-first search (DFS) approach, where you go as deep as possible before backtracking. Or breadth-first search (BFS), which explores all rooms at the current depth level before moving to the next. Since the goal is to minimize the number of room",
