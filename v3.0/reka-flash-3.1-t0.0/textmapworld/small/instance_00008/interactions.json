In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Closet, which has directions west and east. The example given uses a greedy approach, moving in a direction each time until there's nowhere new to go, then stopping. But maybe that's not the most efficient. Wait, the example ends when there are no new rooms left, but maybe there's a way to backtrack and explore other paths to cover all rooms with fewer steps.\n\nWait, the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So room changes are the number of times you switch rooms, i.e., each \"GO\" command counts as a room change. So the goal is to minimize the total number of GO commands needed to visit every room. That sounds like finding the shortest possible path that covers all rooms, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe for a small number of rooms, we can find a heuristic.\n\nBut how do we model the rooms and their connections? The user is in a maze-like structure where each room has certain directions leading to other rooms. The challenge is to explore all rooms with the least steps. So perhaps a depth-first search (DFS)",
