In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the example given starts in the Kitchen, goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and stops. That seems like a linear path. But maybe there's a more efficient way if there are branches. Wait, the problem says \"fewest number of room changes,\" which I think refers to the number of moves, not the number of rooms. So each time you move from one room to another, that's a room change. So the goal is to minimize the total number of moves to visit all rooms.\n\nThis sounds like a classic graph traversal problem. Each room is a node, and each direction is an edge. We need to find the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so for a small number of rooms, maybe we can do it manually or with some backtracking.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a step-by-step solution here, perhaps the maze isn't too complex. Let's see. The starting point is the Closet. Available directions: south, west. So the initial room is Closet. Let's assume the maze is a grid, but we don't know the layout. Wait,",
