	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each room has available directions, and I need to choose the direction that leads to unvisited rooms first to minimize backtracking. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably best approached with BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which would ensure the shortest path.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the user wants the fewest room changes. Each "GO: DIRECTION" is a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. That's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since the problem is presented in a maze-like structure with known connections, maybe we can model it as a graph and find the shortest path that visits all nodes. However, TSP is about visiting each node exactly once, but here we might need to revisit rooms if necessary, but the problem says "visit all the rooms", so maybe each room must be visited at least once. But the example shows that once you enter a room, you might have to backtrack, but the goal is to minimize the number of steps (room changes) to visit all rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example given: starting in Kitchen, goes west to Lobby, north to Bedroom, then DONE. So in that case,
