In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Guest room. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each room has available directions, and I need to choose the direction that leads to unvisited rooms first to minimize backtracking. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably best approached with BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which would ensure the shortest path.\n\nWait, but the user wants the fewest room changes. Each \"GO: DIRECTION\" is a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. That's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard, but since the problem is about finding the minimal number of steps (room changes) to visit all rooms, maybe it's more about finding the shortest path that visits each room once. However, the problem doesn't specify that we need to visit each room exactly once, just to visit all of them. So perhaps it's possible to revisit rooms as long as all are eventually visited, but the minimal steps would likely involve visiting each room once.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since the layout isn't given, I need to build a map as I go. Each time I enter a room, I note the available directions and which ones lead to unvisited rooms. The challenge is to choose directions that",
