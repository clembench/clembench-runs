In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Pantry, and the only available direction is north. So the first move has to be north. Let's say I go north from the Pantry. Then I'll enter whatever room is there. Let's assume that's Room A. Now, I need to explore all rooms connected to Room A. But without knowing the map, I have to keep track of visited rooms and directions taken.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms,\" but how many rooms are there? The example shows moving through Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom, etc. So maybe the number of rooms isn't specified, and the task is to explore until all possible rooms are visited, but in the fewest steps. But how do I know when all rooms are visited? The user mentions recognizing when there are no new rooms to visit. So perhaps when all adjacent rooms have already been visited, then we can stop.\n\nBut the challenge is to do this with the fewest room changes. Room changes are each time you move from one room to another.",
