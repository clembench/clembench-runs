	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Bedroom. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given during the interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Bedroom, available direction is east. So the first move is probably east. Let's say I go east. Then I'll be in another room, maybe a Living Room? Wait, but the example had Kitchen, Lobby, Bedroom. So maybe each move leads to a new room. But without knowing the map, I need to explore systematically.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem says "visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible." So room changes are the number of times you move from one room to another. Each "GO" command is a room change. So the goal is to minimize the total number of GO commands needed to visit every room. That sounds like finding the shortest possible path that covers all rooms, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so for a small number of rooms, maybe we can find a path manually.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I know how many rooms there are? The user hasn't specified. So perhaps the exploration is ongoing until all rooms are visited. Wait, the problem says "recogn
