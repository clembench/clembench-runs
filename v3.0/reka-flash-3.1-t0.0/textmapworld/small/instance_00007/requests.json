In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Home theater. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Home theater, and the available direction is west. So the first move is probably to go west. But wait, maybe there's a strategy here. Since we want to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, we need to explore efficiently. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path. But since we need to visit all rooms, it's more like the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is NP-hard. However, given that the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure, maybe we can use BFS to explore each room and track visited rooms to ensure we don't revisit them unnecessarily.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So room changes are the number of moves, right? Each time you go from one room to another, that's a room change. So the total number of moves needed to visit all rooms is the objective. So the challenge",
