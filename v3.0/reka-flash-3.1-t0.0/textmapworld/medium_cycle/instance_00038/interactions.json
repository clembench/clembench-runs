In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Bar. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?",

Each time I'm in a room, I have to choose a direction to go, and I need to make sure that I don't revisit rooms unnecessarily. Also, once there are no new rooms left to visit, I should stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the rooms. Since the example starts in the Kitchen and goes west to the Lobby, then north to another room, etc., it seems like the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure. The challenge is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. This reminds me of the classic \"traversal\" problem, similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, but here we want the minimal number of steps (room changes) to visit all rooms.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible\". So each move to a new room counts as a change. So the goal is to visit all rooms with the least number of moves. That's equivalent to finding the shortest possible path that visits every room at least once. This is known as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. However, since the problem is presented in a maze-like scenario, maybe the structure is such that a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach can be adapted.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a step-by",
