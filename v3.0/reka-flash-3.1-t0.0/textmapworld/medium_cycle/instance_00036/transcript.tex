	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Pantry. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the starting point is the Pantry, and the available direction is south. So the first move is probably to go south. But wait, maybe there's a strategy here. Since we want to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, but the problem says "fewest number of room changes possible." Wait, maybe "room changes" refers to the number of times you switch rooms. Each time you move from one room to another, that's a room change. So the goal is to visit all rooms with the least number of room changes, which is equivalent to visiting all rooms in the shortest possible path.\\ \tt \\ \tt So this is essentially finding the shortest path that visits all rooms, which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is NP-hard, but maybe in this case, the room layout is a simple graph, and we can find a path that covers all nodes with minimal edges. But since we don't have the map, we need to explore the rooms step by step
