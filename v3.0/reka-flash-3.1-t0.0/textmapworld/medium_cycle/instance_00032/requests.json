You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each room has available directions, and I need to choose the direction that leads to unvisited rooms first to minimize backtracking. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably best approached with BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which would ensure the shortest path.\n\nWait, but the user wants the fewest room changes. Each \"GO: DIRECTION\" is a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. That's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard, but since the problem is about finding the minimal number of steps (room changes) to visit all rooms, maybe it's more about finding the shortest path that visits each room exactly once. However, the problem doesn't specify whether rooms can be revisited. The example given seems to visit each room once. So perhaps the task is to traverse all rooms without revisiting any, which would form a path that visits each room once. But in a maze-like structure, that's only possible if the graph is a tree (no cycles), but if there are cycles, you might have to revisit some rooms. Wait, but the example ends with DONE when there are no new rooms to visit. So maybe",
