In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Playroom. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Playroom, and the only available direction is north. So the first move has to be north. Let's say I go north. Then I'll enter whatever room is there. But without knowing the map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken. Wait, but the problem says to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Room changes probably refer to the number of moves, right? Each time you go from one room to another, that's a room change. So the total number of moves should be minimized.\n\nThis sounds like a graph traversal problem. To visit all nodes (rooms) with the least edges (room changes), we need to use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is typically used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, but here we need to visit all rooms, which is more like finding the shortest path that covers all nodes. That's the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since",
