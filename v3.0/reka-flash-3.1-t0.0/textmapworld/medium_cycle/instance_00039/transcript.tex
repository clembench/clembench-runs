	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Home gym. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the house? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Home gym, the available direction is west. So the first move is probably to go west. Let's say I go west into another room. Wait, but without knowing the map, how can I plan ahead? Maybe I need to explore systematically. The example given in the problem shows that the user is making decisions based on available directions each time. So each step, I have to choose a direction from the current room's available options.\\ \tt \\ \tt The challenge is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Room changes mean moving from one room to another. So each "GO" command is a room change. The goal is to minimize the total number of such moves. That sounds like finding the shortest possible path that visits every room at least once. This is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard, but since the problem is presented in a step-by-step manner, maybe the house layout isn't too complex, and we can find a path without backtracking too much.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I approach this without knowing the entire map? It's
