Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Billiard room with available directions north and south. The challenge is to explore all rooms without getting stuck and ensuring that each move leads to unvisited rooms. But since I don't have a map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken. Wait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms,\" but how many rooms are there? The example shows moving through several rooms, but the actual number isn't specified here. So maybe the rooms are connected in a way that I need to traverse them all, and the task is to do so with the minimal number of room changes (i.e., steps). \n\nWait, the problem says \"the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So each time I move from one room to another, that's a room change. So the objective is to visit all rooms in as few steps as possible. That sounds like finding the shortest possible path that covers all rooms, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so",
