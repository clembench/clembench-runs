You are in the Solarium. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Solarium, and the available direction is west. So the first move is probably to go west. But wait, maybe there's a strategy here. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, I need to explore in a way that covers all rooms efficiently. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, specifically a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path. But since we need to visit all rooms, it's more like the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is NP-hard. However, given that the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure, maybe a depth-first search (DFS) could help, but DFS might not find the shortest path. Alternatively, BFS could help in exploring all possible paths level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found. But without knowing the entire map, it's tricky.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So room changes are the number of",
