In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start.

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Kitchen. Available directions are south and east. The example given in the problem shows that the user is making decisions based on the current room and available directions. The challenge is to explore all rooms without getting stuck and to minimize the number of moves.\n\nWait, but how do I know when all rooms are visited? The problem says to recognize when there are no new rooms to visit and then decide to stop. So, maybe once I can't go anywhere new, that's when I'm done. But how do I track which rooms I've already been to? Because if I revisit a room, that's not necessary. So I need to keep a record of visited rooms to avoid cycles.\n\nBut the user hasn't provided any memory of previous rooms. Wait, in the example, the assistant is supposed to generate the next move based on the current state. So perhaps each time the user provides the current room and available directions, the assistant must decide the next move, keeping track of visited rooms internally.
