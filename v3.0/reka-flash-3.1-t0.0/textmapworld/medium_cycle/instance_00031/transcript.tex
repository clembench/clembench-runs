	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Sauna, and the available direction is west. So the first move has to be west. Let me note that down. But wait, maybe there's a way to explore other directions first? But since the initial available direction is only west, I can't choose anything else. So the first step is GO: west.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once I move west from the Sauna, where am I? Let's assume that moving west from the Sauna takes me to another room. Let's say that's the Living Room. Now, the available directions there might be east (back to Sauna) and maybe others like north, south, etc. But I don't know the actual layout. Wait, the problem doesn't provide a map. So how can I plan the path?\\ \tt \\ \tt Oh, right, this is like a maze exploration problem. The agent has to navigate through rooms, keeping track of visited rooms to avoid cycles and ensure all rooms are visited. The challenge is to do this with the minimal number of steps. But since the actual layout isn't given, the user is probably expecting a general strategy rather than a specific path.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the example provided shows a sequence of moves. The
