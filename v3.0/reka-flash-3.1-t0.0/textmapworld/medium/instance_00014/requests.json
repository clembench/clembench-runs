In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north.

You are in the Utility room. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step.\n\nStarting in the Utility room, available directions are south and east. The challenge is to decide which direction to go first. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves (steps) taken, I need to explore in a way that covers all rooms efficiently. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest path. But since we don't have the entire map, we have to build it as we go.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for a step-by-step decision. So each time, I have to choose a direction, and then based on the next room's available directions, continue. The key is to avoid getting stuck in a loop and ensure that all rooms are visited. But how do I track which rooms have been visited already? The problem statement doesn't mention tracking visited rooms, but logically, we need to remember where we've been to prevent revisiting and getting stuck.\n\nWait, the example given shows that once there are no new rooms to visit, we stop. So",
