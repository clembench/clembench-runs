In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Sauna. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each time I'm in a room, I have to choose a direction to go. Once there are no new rooms left to visit, I should stop with DONE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure here. It seems like a maze or a graph where each room is a node, and directions are edges connecting them. The challenge is to traverse all nodes (rooms) with the least number of steps (room changes). Wait, but the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" So each time I move to a neighboring room, that's a room change. So the objective is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms, which is essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe there's a simpler approach here given the constraints.\n\nBut since this is a step-by-step interaction, perhaps the rooms are connected in a way that allows a systematic exploration. Maybe a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach? But DFS can get stuck in a long path, while BFS explores all possibilities level by level. However, since we need the fewest room changes, BFS might be better because it explores all rooms at the current depth before moving to deeper levels. But BFS can be memory-intensive. Alternatively, maybe a greedy approach where each step chooses the direction",
