In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Dining room, and the only available direction is north. So the first move has to be north. Let's say I go north. Then I'll enter whatever room is there. But without knowing the map, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the paths taken. Wait, but the problem says to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes. Room changes probably refer to the number of moves, right? Each time you go from one room to another, that's a room change. So the total number of moves should be minimized to visit all rooms.\n\nThis sounds like a graph traversal problem. To visit all nodes (rooms) with the least edges (room changes), we need to find the shortest possible path that covers all rooms. That's essentially the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But since the problem is presented in a step-by-step manner, maybe the layout is small enough that a backtracking approach could work, but I need to do it interactively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the",
