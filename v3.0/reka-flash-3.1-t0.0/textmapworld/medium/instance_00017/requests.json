You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the example given starts in the Kitchen, goes west to the Lobby, then north to the Bedroom, and stops. That seems like a linear path. But maybe there's a more efficient way if there are branches. Wait, the problem says \"fewest number of room changes,\" which I think refers to the number of moves, not the number of rooms. So each time you move from one room to another, that's a room change. So the goal is to minimize the total number of moves to visit all rooms.\n\nThis sounds like a classic graph traversal problem. Each room is a node, and each direction is an edge. We need to find the shortest path that visits all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so for a small number of rooms, maybe we can do it manually or with some backtracking.\n\nBut since the user is asking for a step-by-step solution here, perhaps the maze isn't too complex. Let's see. The starting point is the Closet. Available directions: south, west. So the initial room is Closet. Let's assume the maze is a grid, but we don't know the layout. Wait,",
