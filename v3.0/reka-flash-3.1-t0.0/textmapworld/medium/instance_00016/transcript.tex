	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Laundry room. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. Each time I'm in a room, I have to choose a direction to go. Once there are no new rooms left to visit, I should stop.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to understand the structure of the rooms. Since the example starts in the Kitchen and moves west to the Lobby, then north to a Bedroom, etc., it seems like the rooms are connected in a maze-like structure. But without a map, I have to figure out the connections as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt The challenge is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. This sounds like the classic "traversal" problem, similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem but in a graph where each node is a room and edges are directions. The goal is to visit all nodes with the least number of steps (room changes). However, since the problem allows any order as long as all rooms are visited with the fewest steps, maybe a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach could work. But since we need the minimal number of steps, BFS might be better because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring the shortest path first. However, since we need to visit all rooms, it's more like finding the shortest Hamiltonian path, which is NP-hard. But given that the problem might have a specific structure, maybe a greedy approach would suffice.
