In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use \"GO: DIRECTION\" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\nGO: west\nYou have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\nGO: north\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\nDONE\nLet us start. You are in the Billiard room. Currently available directions: south, west, east. What is your next instruction?",

So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Billiard room, which has directions south, west, and east. The example given uses a greedy approach, choosing directions one by one, but maybe that's not the most efficient. Wait, the example ended with DONE when there were no more rooms to visit. But in the example, they went through several rooms, but maybe there were more rooms left? Or perhaps the example just ended when they couldn't go further. Wait, the example's last step was entering a Bedroom with only south direction, but they chose DONE. Maybe the example ended because there were no new rooms left to visit. So, the key is to explore all rooms, but in a way that minimizes the number of steps (room changes) needed.\n\nThis sounds like a graph traversal problem. Each room is a node, and each direction is an edge. The goal is to visit all nodes with the minimal number of edges (steps). Wait, but minimal number of steps to visit all rooms would be equivalent to finding the shortest path that covers all nodes, which is the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, TSP is NP-hard, so for a small number of rooms, maybe we can",
