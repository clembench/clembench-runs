To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text.\nHere is an example:\nYou are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west.

You are in the Media room. Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I know the layout of the rooms? The user hasn't provided a map, so I must be working with the information given step by step as I move through the rooms.\n\nFirst, the starting point is the Media room with available directions north and south. The challenge is to decide which direction to go first. Since the goal is to minimize room changes, which I assume means the number of moves (each GO command is a room change), I need to explore in a way that covers all rooms with the least steps. This sounds like a graph traversal problem, probably a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path, but since we need to visit all rooms, it's more like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is NP-hard. But maybe the structure here is such that it's a grid or a tree, making it manageable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.\" So the objective is to minimize the total number of moves (each time you go from one room to another counts as a change). So the path should be the shortest possible to cover all rooms. However, without knowing the entire layout, I need to explore step by step",
