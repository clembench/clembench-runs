	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use "GO: DIRECTION" and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt You are in the Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: west\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Lobby. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt GO: north\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt DONE\\ \tt Let us start. You are in the Wine cellar. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the optimal path that covers all rooms with the least steps. But how do I approach this?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Wine cellar, which has directions west and east available. The example given uses a greedy approach, choosing directions to explore new rooms first. Maybe a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) strategy would work here. But since the goal is to minimize the number of room changes, which I think refers to the number of moves, BFS might be better because it explores all possibilities level by level, ensuring the shortest path. However, the problem isn't just about finding the shortest path to a single room but visiting all rooms. So maybe it's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem, but in a maze-like structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the problem states "visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible." So the objective is to traverse all rooms in the least number of moves. That's the classic Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-hard. But since this is a maze-like structure, perhaps it's a grid or has a specific layout. However, the user hasn't provided the map, so I need to figure it out as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt The challenge here is that each time I move, I might be entering a room that connects
