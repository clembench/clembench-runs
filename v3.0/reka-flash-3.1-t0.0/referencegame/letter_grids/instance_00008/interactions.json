I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ □ □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has full rows (all X) in rows 1, 3, and 5. Rows 2 and 4 have X in the first and last positions, but the middle three are empty (□). So it's like a cross shape? Wait, no. Wait, rows 1,3,5 are all filled. Rows 2 and 4 have X at the ends and empty in the middle. So the filled parts are the top, middle (row 3), and bottom rows, but rows 2 and 4 have only the first and last cells filled. Hmm. So the filled areas are like a horizontal bar in the middle (row 3) and vertical bars on the left and right sides? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, rows 1,3,5 are all X. So that's three full horizontal lines",
