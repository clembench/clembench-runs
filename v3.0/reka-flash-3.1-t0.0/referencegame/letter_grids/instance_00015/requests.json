Omit any other text. <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ X X\nRow 3: □ □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X X □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has a full top and bottom row (all Xs). The middle rows (rows 2-4) have some empty cells (□) forming a sort of pattern. Specifically, in row 2, the first three are empty, then two Xs. Row 3: first two empty, then two Xs, then empty. Row 4: first empty, two Xs, then two empty. So it's like a diamond shape or maybe a cross? Wait, maybe it's a central cross? Let me check.\n\nWait, rows 2-4: the Xs are moving inward. Row 2 has Xs starting at column 4 and 5. Row 3 starts at 3 and 4. Row 4 starts at 2 and 3. So it's like a diagonal line of Xs moving from right to left",
