I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ X X\nRow 3: □ □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X X □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has a solid top and bottom row (all Xs). The middle rows (rows 2-4) have some empty cells (□) forming a sort of pattern. Specifically, in row 2, the first three cells are empty, then two Xs. Row 3: first two empty, then two Xs, then empty. Row 4: first empty, two Xs, then two empty. So it's like a diamond shape or maybe a cross? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, rows 2-4: \n\nRow 2: □□□XX\n\nRow3: □□XX□\n\nRow4: □XX□□\n\nSo if I imagine this, starting from the top, the first two rows are full. Then in row 2, the",
