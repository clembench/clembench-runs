I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ X X\nRow 3: □ □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X X □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has a solid top and bottom row (all Xs). The middle rows (rows 2-4) have some empty cells (□) forming a sort of pattern. Specifically, in row 2, the first three cells are empty, then two Xs. Row 3: first two empty, then two Xs, then empty. Row 4: first empty, two Xs, then two empty. So it's like a diamond shape or maybe a cross? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, rows 2-4: \n\nRow 2: □□□XX\n\nRow3: □□XX□\n\nRow4: □XX□□\n\nSo if I imagine this, starting from the top, the first two rows are full. Then in row 2, the",
