I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. Let me write it out:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the pattern here is that the first, third, and fifth rows are completely filled with X's. The second and fourth rows have X's at the first and fifth positions, and empty cells (□) in the middle. Specifically, row 2 is X □ X □ X, and row 4 is the same. So the empty cells are in positions 2 and 4 of rows 2 and 4. That creates a sort of diagonal or cross pattern? Wait, maybe it's like a checkerboard but only in the middle rows. Let me visualize it:\n\nRows 1,3,5: all X's. Rows 2 and 4: X at the edges, □ in the middle two cells. So the empty cells are in the second and fourth columns of rows 2 and 4. So the pattern is that",
