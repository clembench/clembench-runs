I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ □ □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has full rows (all X) in rows 1, 3, and 5. Rows 2 and 4 have X in the first and last positions, but the middle three are empty (□). So it's like a cross shape? Wait, no. Wait, rows 1,3,5 are all filled. Rows 2 and 4 have X at the ends and empty in the middle. So the filled areas are the top, middle, and bottom rows (1,3,5) being full, and the second and fourth rows have X only at the first and last columns. So the filled parts form a sort of vertical line in the middle? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, rows 1,3,5 are all Xs. So that's three full horizontal lines. Rows 2 and 4 have X",
