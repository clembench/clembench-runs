I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: X □ □ □ □\nRow 3: X X X X X\nRow 4: X □ □ □ □\nRow 5: X X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has full rows (all X) in rows 1, 3, and 5. Rows 2 and 4 have X in the first and last positions, but the middle three are empty (□). So it's like a cross shape? Wait, no. Wait, rows 1,3,5 are all filled. Rows 2 and 4 have X at the ends and empty in the middle. So the filled areas are the top, middle, and bottom rows (1,3,5) being full, and the second and fourth rows have X only at the first and last columns. So the filled parts form a sort of vertical line in the middle? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, rows 1,3,5 are all Xs. So that's three full horizontal lines. Rows 2 and 4 have X",
