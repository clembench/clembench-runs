I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. The target grid is the first one, and the other two are distractors. The grids are 5x5, with Xs and □s.\n\nFirst, I should look at the target grid and see what unique patterns or features it has that the distractors don't. Let me write down the target grid again to visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X □\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X □\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X □ X\n\nNow, let's check Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: X X □ □ X\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X □ X X\nRow 5: X □ □ X X\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X □\nRow 2: □ X □ X X\nRow 3: X X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X X □ X\nRow 5: X □ X □ �",
