The target grid is the first one, and the other two are distractors. The grids are 5x5, with Xs and □s.\n\nFirst, I should look at the target grid and see what unique patterns or features it has that the distractors don't. Let me write down the target grid again to visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X □ X □\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ □ X □\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: X □ X □ X\n\nNow, let's check Distractor 1:\n\nRow 1: X X □ □ X\nRow 2: □ X X □ X\nRow 3: X □ X X □\nRow 4: □ X □ X X\nRow 5: X □ □ X X\n\nDistractor 2:\n\nRow 1: X □ X X □\nRow 2: □ X □ X X\nRow 3: X X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X X □ X\nRow 5: X □ X □ �",
