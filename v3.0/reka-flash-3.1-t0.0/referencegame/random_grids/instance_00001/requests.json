I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, let me visualize each grid. The target grid is:\n\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nSo, looking at this, it seems like there's a checkerboard pattern. Each row alternates between X and □, starting with X in the second row and □ in the first. Wait, actually, let me check again. Row 1 starts with □, then X, □, X, □. Row 2 starts with X, then □, X, □, X. So each row alternates, but the starting symbol alternates between rows. So rows 1, 3, 5 start with □, and rows 2,4 start with X. So it's like a checkerboard where the color alternates both in rows and columns. So every other cell is filled, creating a diagonal pattern? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the target grid, each row alternates between X and",
