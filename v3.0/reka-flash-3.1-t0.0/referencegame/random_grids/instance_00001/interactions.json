I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, let me visualize each grid. The target grid is:\n\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nSo, looking at this, it seems like there's a checkerboard pattern. Each row alternates between X and □, starting with X in the second row and □ in the first. Wait, actually, let me check again. Row 1 starts with □, then X, □, X, □. Row 2 starts with X, then □, X, □, X. So each row alternates, but the starting symbol alternates between rows. So rows 1, 3, 5 start with □, and rows 2,4 start with X. So it's like a checkerboard where the color alternates both in rows and columns. So every other cell is filled, creating a diagonal pattern? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the target grid, each row alternates between X and",
