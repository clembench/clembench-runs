I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, let me visualize each grid. The target grid is:\n\nRow 1: □ X X □ X\nRow 2: X □ X X □\nRow 3: □ X □ X X\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X X □ □\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X □ X □\nRow 2: X □ X □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ X □\nRow 4: X □ X □ X\nRow 5: □ X □ X □\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n\nRow 1: □ □ X X □\nRow 2: X □ □ X X\nRow 3: □ X X □ X\nRow 4: X X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X □ □\n\nOkay, so each grid is 5x5. The target and distractors have Xs and empty cells (□). The task is to find a description that uniquely identifies the target grid",
