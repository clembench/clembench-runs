Omit any other text. <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let's start by looking at each grid carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is □ X X □ X. So, each row has five cells. The pattern here is that the second and third cells are filled (X), and the first, fourth, and fifth are empty (□). So, each row is like □ X X □ X. That's a repeating pattern every two cells? Wait, no. Let me check each row again. Yes, each row is the same: positions 2 and 3 are X, others are □. So, the target grid has a horizontal pattern where in every row, the middle two cells are filled. So, it's like a horizontal bar in each row, but only two cells wide. So, maybe the description could mention that each row has two Xs in the middle.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor grid 1. Each row is □ □ X X X. So, each row starts with two empty cells, then three filled. So, a horizontal block of three Xs starting at the third column. So, each row has a horizontal block of three Xs. That's different from the target's two Xs in the middle.\n\nDistractor grid 2 is a bit more complex.",
