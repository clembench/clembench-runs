I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row has three empty cells (□) followed by two filled cells (X). So, the pattern is □□□XX repeated five times. All rows are identical in this structure.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor grid 1. Each row here starts with two empty cells, then three filled cells. So the pattern is □□XXX, repeated five times. That's the opposite of the target in terms of the number of Xs and their position.\n\nDistractor grid 2 has each row starting with a filled cell, followed by two empty, then two filled. So the pattern is X□□XX, again five times. Here, the X is at the beginning instead of the end.\n\nSo the key differences are where the Xs are located. The target has Xs at the end of each row, distractor 1 has them in the middle (last three cells), and distractor 2 has them at the start. The number of Xs is the same in all three: two Xs per row. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again.\n\nWait, target grid: each row is □□□XX. So three empty,",
