          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let's start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. All rows are the same: five cells each, with the first two being empty (□) and the last three filled (X). So each row is □ □ X X X. That's five rows of that pattern. So the entire grid is a 5x5 where the left two columns are empty and the right three are filled. So maybe I can describe it as a grid where the left two columns are empty and the right three are filled. But wait, let me check the distractors to make sure that's unique.\n\nDistractor grid 1: Each row starts with three empty cells, then two filled. So each row is □ □ □ X X. So here, the first three columns are empty, last two filled. So the position of the filled cells is different. The target has filled cells starting from column 3 (if columns are 1-5), but distractor 1 has filled starting from column 4. Wait, no. Let me count. Each row in target is □ □ X X X. So columns 1 and 2 are empty, 3,4,5 are filled. Distractor 1 is □ □ �",
