Let me start by carefully looking at all three grids.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all filled with X's, and the rest of the rows (rows 2, 3, 4, 5) are all empty (□). So the target has a solid top row and empty rows below. Let me visualize that:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 3: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 4: X X X X X\nRow 5: □ □ □ □ □\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the user wrote the target grid as:\n\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\n□ □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\n\nWait, that's five rows. Let me count. First line is row 1: all X. Then row 2: all □. Row 3: all □. Row 4: all X. Row 5: all □. So the target grid has two solid rows (",
