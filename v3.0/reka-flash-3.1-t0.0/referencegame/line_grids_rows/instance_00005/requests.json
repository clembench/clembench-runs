Omit any other text. <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let's start by looking at the grids.\n\nThe target grid is all filled in the rightmost three columns. Each row has three X's followed by two □. So, it's a solid block of X's on the right side. Let me check the distractors.\n\nDistractor grid 1 has the rightmost two columns filled. Each row has two X's and three □. So, it's narrower than the target. Distractor grid 2 has the leftmost column filled and the rightmost two columns filled. Each row starts with an X, then two □, then two X's. So, it's a combination of left and right filled areas.\n\nThe key differences are the positions and numbers of filled cells. The target has three X's in a vertical block on the right. Distractor 1 has two X's on the right, and Distractor 2 has X's on the left and right. So, the referring expression should highlight the three X's in the rightmost columns, maybe specifying that it's a vertical block spanning all rows. Also, mention that the left side is empty. Alternatively, compare to the distractors: unlike the others which have X's in different positions or fewer columns.\n\nPossible phrases: \"A 5x5 grid with three",
