Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is \"X X □ X X\". So, in every row, the first two and last two cells are filled with X, and the middle one is empty. That means each row has two Xs on the left, a space in the center, and two Xs on the right. So the pattern is like two Xs, a blank, two Xs, repeating across each row. All five rows are the same.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor grid 1: \"X □ □ X X\". Each row here has an X at the start, then three empty cells, and then an X at the end. Wait, no, let me check again. The first row is X □ □ X X. So positions 1, 4, 5 are X? Wait, no. Let's parse each row. For Distractor 1, each row is X followed by three □, then X X? Wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is \"X □ □ X X\". So positions 1 is X, 2 is □, 3 is □, 4 is X, 5 is X.
