I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is \"X X □ X X\". So, in every row, the first two and last two cells are filled with X, and the middle one is empty. That means each row has two Xs on the left, a space in the center, and two Xs on the right. So the pattern is like two Xs, a blank, two Xs, repeating across each row. All five rows are the same.\n\nNow, looking at Distractor grid 1: \"X □ □ X X\". Each row here has an X at the start, then three empty cells, and then an X at the end. Wait, no, let me check again. The first row is X □ □ X X. So positions 1, 4, 5 are X? Wait, no. Let's parse each row. For Distractor 1, each row is X followed by three □, then X X? Wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is \"X □ □ X X\". So positions 1 is X, 2 is □, 3 is □, 4 is X, 5 is X. So each",
