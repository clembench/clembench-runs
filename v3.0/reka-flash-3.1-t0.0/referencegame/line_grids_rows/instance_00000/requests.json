I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let me start by carefully looking at all three grids.\n\nFirst, the target grid. It's a 5x5 grid. The first row is all filled with X's, and the rest of the rows (rows 2, 3, 4, 5) are all empty (□). So the target has a solid top row and empty rows below. Let me visualize that:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 3: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 4: X X X X X\nRow 5: □ □ □ □ □\n\nWait, wait.
