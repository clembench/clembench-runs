I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is X □ X X □. So, in each of the five rows, the first and fifth cells are X, the second is empty, and the third and fourth are X. So the pattern is X, empty, X, X, empty. Let me visualize that. Each row starts and ends with X, with a gap in the second position and another gap at the end. Wait, no: the first cell is X, second is □, third is X, fourth is X, fifth is □. So the pattern is X, empty, X, X, empty. So in each row, the X's are in positions 1, 3, 4, and the fifth is empty. So each row has three X's and two empty cells, but arranged in a specific way.\n\nNow, Distractor grid 1: all rows are □ □ X X X. So each row starts with two empty cells, followed by three X's. So in each row, positions 3,4,5 are X, and 1,2 are empty. So that's a horizontal block of three X's starting at column 3.\n\nDistractor",
