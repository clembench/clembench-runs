I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is □ X X □ X. So, each row has five cells. The first and fifth cells are empty (□), the second and third are filled (X), and the fourth is empty again. So, the pattern per row is □ X X □ X. That means in each row, there's a sequence of two X's in the middle, but not exactly the middle because the positions are 2 and 3. Wait, positions 2 and 3 are the second and third cells. So each row has X's in positions 2 and 3, with empty cells at the start and end. So the pattern is like \"empty, X, X, empty, X\" per row. Wait, no: the first cell is empty, then two X's, then empty, then X. So each row is □ X X □ X. So each row has three X's? Wait, no: positions 2,3,5 are X. So each row has three X's. Let me count: positions 1: □, 2: X, 3: X, 4: □, 5: X.",
