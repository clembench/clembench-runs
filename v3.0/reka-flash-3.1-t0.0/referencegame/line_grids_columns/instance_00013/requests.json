I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is □ X X □ X. So, each row has five cells. The first and fifth cells are empty (□), the second and third are filled (X), and the fourth is empty again. So, the pattern per row is □ X X □ X. That means in each row, there's a sequence of two X's in the middle, but not exactly the middle because the positions are 2 and 3. Wait, positions 2 and 3 are the second and third cells. So each row has X's in positions 2 and 3, with empty cells at the start and end. So the pattern is like \"empty, X, X, empty, X\" per row. Wait, no: the first cell is empty, then two X's, then empty, then X. So each row is □ X X □ X. So each row has three X's? Wait, no: positions 2,3,5 are X. So each row has three X's. Let me count: positions 1: □, 2: X, 3: X, 4: □, 5: X.",
