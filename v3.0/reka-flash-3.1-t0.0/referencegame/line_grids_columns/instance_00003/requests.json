Omit any other text. <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Each row is \"X □ □ X X\". So, in every row, the first and last cells are filled with X, and the middle three are empty. That makes a sort of diagonal or two vertical lines? Wait, no. Let me visualize each row. Each row has X at position 1 and 5, and □ in 2,3,4. So each row is like X □ □ X X. So across the grid, every row starts and ends with X, and the middle three are empty. So if I look at the entire grid, it's like two vertical lines on the leftmost and rightmost columns, but only the first and last cells of each row are filled. Wait, no. Wait, each row has X in the first and fifth positions. So each row is X, then three empty, then X. So each row is like a horizontal line at the start and end. So the entire grid would have the first column filled with Xs (since each row's first cell is X) and the fifth column filled with Xs. Wait, no. Wait, each row's first cell is X, so the first column is all X",
