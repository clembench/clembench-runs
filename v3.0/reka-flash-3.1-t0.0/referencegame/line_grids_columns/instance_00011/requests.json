Omit any other text. <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to create a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at each grid.\n\nFirst, the target grid. All the cells in the first three columns are filled with X, and the last two columns are empty (□). So each row is X X X □ □. That's five rows, each with three Xs followed by two empty spaces. So the pattern here is three Xs in a row, starting from the left, and then two empty cells. So maybe I can describe it as a 3x3 block on the left side? Wait, but each row has three Xs, but they're in the same columns each time. So columns 1, 2, 3 are all Xs, and 4,5 are empty. So it's like a vertical block of three Xs in each row, but actually, each row has three Xs in the first three columns. So the entire left three columns are filled, and the right two are empty. Wait, no. Wait, each row has three Xs in the first three columns. So each row is three Xs followed by two empty. So the entire grid's left three columns are filled, but each row is three Xs. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nTarget grid:\nRow 1: X X X �",
