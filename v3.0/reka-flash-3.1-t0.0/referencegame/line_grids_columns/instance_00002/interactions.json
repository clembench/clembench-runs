          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. Let me start by looking at all three grids carefully.\n\nFirst, the target grid. All rows are the same: five cells each, with the first two being empty (□) and the last three filled (X). So it's like two empty squares followed by three Xs in every row. That makes a solid block of Xs starting from the third column to the end, across all five rows. So the structure is consistent vertically and horizontally.\n\nNow, Distractor grid 1. Each row starts with an X, then three empty squares, and ends with an X. So the Xs are at the beginning and end of each row, with three empty in the middle. That's like a horizontal line of Xs at the start and end of each row, but not connected vertically. So each row has two Xs at the ends, but the next row's Xs don't connect to the previous ones. So it's more like two Xs per row, separated by three empty cells, but arranged such that each row's Xs are at the first and fifth positions.\n\nDistractor grid 2. Each row has the first cell empty, then three Xs in the middle, and the last cell empty. So the Xs are in columns 2, 3, 4",
