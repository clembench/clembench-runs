I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 3: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 4: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 5: □ □ □ □ X\n\nSo, the first row is completely filled with X's. The next four rows have four empty cells (□) and one X each, but where are those X's? Looking at each row:\n\nRow 2: The last cell is X. So positions (2,5) is X.\nRow 3: Similarly, (3,5) is X.\nRow 4: (4,5) is X.\nRow 5: (5,5) is X.\n\nSo the target grid has a solid top row and a vertical line of X's on the rightmost column starting from row 2 to row 5. So the X's are in positions (1,1) to (1,5) and (2,5) to (5,5). Wait, no. Wait, row 1 is all X's. Then",
