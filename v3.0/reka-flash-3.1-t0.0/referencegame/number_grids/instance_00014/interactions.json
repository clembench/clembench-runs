I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, let's visualize each grid. The target grid is:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has a specific pattern. Let me compare each row with the distractors.\n\nLooking at the first row of all grids: they are the same. So that's not a distinguishing feature.\n\nRow",
