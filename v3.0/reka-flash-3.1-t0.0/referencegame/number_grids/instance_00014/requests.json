I need to generate a referring expression that describes the target grid and distinguishes it from the two distractor grids. I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, let's visualize each grid. The target grid is:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X □ □ X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ X □ □ X\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n\nRow 1: □ X X X X\nRow 2: □ X □ □ X\nRow 3: □ X X X X\nRow 4: □ □ □ □ □\nRow 5: □ X X X X\n\nSo, the target grid has a specific pattern.
