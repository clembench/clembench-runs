I'll start by carefully looking at all three grids to understand their differences.\n\nFirst, the target grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: X X X X X\nRow 2: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 3: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 4: □ □ □ □ X\nRow 5: □ □ □ □ X\n\nSo, the first row is completely filled with X's. The next four rows have four empty cells (□) and one X each, but where are those X's? Looking at each row:\n\nRow 2: The last cell is X. So positions (2,5) is X.\nRow 3: Similarly, (3,5) is X.\nRow 4: (4,5) is X.\nRow 5: (5,5) is X.\n\nSo the target grid has a solid top row and a vertical line of X's on the rightmost column starting from row 2 to row 5. So the X's are in positions (1,1) to (1,5) and (2,5) to (5,5). Wait, no. Wait, row 1 is all X's. Then",
