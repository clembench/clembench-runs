You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled. The task is to describe the steps needed to fill the grid by specifying commands that place letters in specific cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. The example given uses commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\".\n\nLooking at the current grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: F F F F F\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: F F F F F\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo, the filled parts are rows 2 and 4, both completely filled with F's. The other rows (1, 3, 5) are all empty. The user wants me to describe the steps to fill this grid, but only mentioning the filled parts. Wait, no—the user says \"describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares... Only describe the location of letters in the grid.\" So the existing filled parts (rows 2 and 4) are already there, and the task is to explain how to reach that state from an empty grid. Wait, no—the user is showing an example where the filled grid is given, and the steps are the commands to build it",
