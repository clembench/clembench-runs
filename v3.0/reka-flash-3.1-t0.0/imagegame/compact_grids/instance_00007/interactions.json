The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nT T T T T\n▢ T T T T\n▢ ▢ T T T\n▢ ▢ ▢ T T\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\nWhat is your next command?",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with Ts and some empty squares (▢). The task is to describe the steps needed to fill this grid by specifying commands that place the Ts in their correct positions, ignoring the empty squares. The example given earlier used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So I need to follow that pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me write it out to visualize:\n\nRow 1: T T T T T\nRow 2: ▢ T T T T\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ T T T\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ T T\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\n\nLooking at this, it seems like each subsequent row has one more empty square at the beginning. The first row is all Ts. The second row starts with an empty, then four Ts. The third row starts with two empties, then three Ts, and so on until the fifth row, which starts with four empties and one T at the end.\n\nWait, but the user's example grid in the problem statement is different. Wait, no, the user is asking me to process the grid they provided here. Let me check again.\n\nThe grid given is:\n\nRow 1: T T T T T\nRow 2:",
