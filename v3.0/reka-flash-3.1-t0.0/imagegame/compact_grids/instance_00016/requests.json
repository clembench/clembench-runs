You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nN N N N N\nN ▢ ▢ ▢ N\nN ▢ N ▢ N\nN ▢ ▢ ▢ N\nN N N N N\nWhat is your next command? <sep> assistant:",

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with Ns and a single ▢. The task is to describe the steps to fill this grid by specifying commands that place letters in specific cells or modify rows/columns. The example given earlier used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\".\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. The grid is:\n\nRow 1: N N N N N\nRow 2: N ▢ ▢ ▢ N\nRow 3: N ▢ N ▢ N\nRow 4: N ▢ ▢ ▢ N\nRow 5: N N N N N\n\nSo, the Ns form a border around the grid, and the inner 3x3 area (rows 2-4, columns 2-4) has some ▢s. Specifically, in row 2, columns 2-4 are ▢; row 3, columns 2 and 4 are ▢; row 4, columns 2-4 are ▢. The center cell (row 3, column 3) is already an N. The rest of the grid is filled with Ns.\n\nThe goal is to fill all the ▢s with Ns to make the entire grid Ns. So the steps needed are to replace each ▢ with an N. Since",
