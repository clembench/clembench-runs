You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with D's and some empty squares (▢). The task is to describe the steps needed to fill this grid by specifying commands that place the D's in their correct positions, ignoring the empty squares. The example given earlier had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling a row with X's.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: D D D D D\nRow 2: D ▢ D ▢ D\nRow 3: D D D D D\nRow 4: D ▢ D ▢ D\nRow 5: D D D D D\n\nSo, the grid is mostly filled with D's, but in the second and fourth rows, the even columns (second and fourth) are empty. Wait, looking at the second row: positions 2 and 4 are empty. Similarly, the fourth row has the same pattern. The other rows (1,3,5) are completely filled with D's.\n\nThe goal is to describe the steps to fill this grid, but since the grid is already partially filled, maybe the user wants to know how to construct it step by step. Wait, the original task was to fill an empty grid, but the example given was a filled grid. Wait, the user's instruction says: \"The goal is to fill an empty grid",
