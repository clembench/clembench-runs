You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nQ Q ▢ Q Q\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\nQ Q ▢ Q Q\nWhat is your next command? <sep> assistant:",

The user provided a 5x5 grid filled with some Qs and a blank, and they want me to describe the steps to fill it, similar to the example. The example had commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a row with Xs. So I need to figure out the positions of the Qs and the empty cell in the given grid and translate that into commands.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid. The user wrote:\n\nRow 1: Q Q ▢ Q Q\nRow 2: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\nRow 5: Q Q ▢ Q Q\n\nWait, but the user mentioned it's a 5x5 grid. Let me check each row. Each row has 5 elements. So rows 1 to 5. The empty cell is represented by ▢. So the task is to describe the positions of the Qs and the empty cell. But according to the example, they only describe the letters (E and X) and not the empty squares. Wait, in the example, the filled grid had E and X, and the empty grid was all ▢. The user's instruction says: \"Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say 'What is your next",
