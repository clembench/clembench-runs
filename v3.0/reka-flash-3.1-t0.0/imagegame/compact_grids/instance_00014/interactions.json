You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nB ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ B ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ B ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ B ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ B\nWhat is your next command?",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid filled with B's in a diagonal pattern. The task is to describe how to fill this grid step by step, only mentioning the positions of the B's, not the empty squares. Each command can target a single cell, multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid. The example given used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\".\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. The B's are placed diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right. So, the first row has B in column 1, the second row in column 2, and so on until the fifth row, column 5. Each B is on the main diagonal of the grid.\n\nThe user wants me to describe the steps to create this grid. Since all B's are on the diagonal, the most efficient way is to command placing B's along the main diagonal. In the example, they used specific commands for each B, but maybe there's a way to do it in one command if possible. However, the example used separate commands for E and X, but here, since all B's are in a diagonal, perhaps a single command can cover them all.\n\nWait, in the example, the first command was placing E in a specific cell, then filling the last row. Here, the B's form a diagonal. So maybe the",
