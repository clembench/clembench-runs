You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with R's and some empty squares (▢). The task is to describe the filled cells step by step, only mentioning the positions of the R's, and then wait for their next command. The example they gave earlier had commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a row with X's.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: R R R R R\nRow 2: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 3: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 4: R ▢ ▢ ▢ R\nRow 5: R R R R R\n\nSo, the grid is mostly R's, but the middle three cells in rows 2, 3, and 4 are empty. The corners and edges are all R's. The center 3x3 area (rows 2-4, columns 2-4) has empty squares. Wait, actually, looking again: rows 2,3,4 each have the first and last columns as R, and the middle three as ▢. So the structure is like a border of R's with a hollow center.\n\nThe user wants me to describe the filled cells (the R's) step by step. Each command can refer to multiple cells, rows, columns, or the whole grid",
