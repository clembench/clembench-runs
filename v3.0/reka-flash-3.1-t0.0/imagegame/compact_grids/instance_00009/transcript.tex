	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid that's already partially filled with I's and empty squares. The task is to describe the filled cells step by step, only mentioning the positions of the letters (I in this case), and then wait for their next command. The example they gave earlier had commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling the last row with X. So I need to follow that structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me write it out again to visualize:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt Row 2: I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt Row 3: I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt Row 4: I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt Row 5: I ▢ I ▢ I\\ \tt \\ \tt Each row starts and ends with I, and the odd columns (1st, 3rd, 5th) have I's, while the even columns (2nd, 4th) are empty. So in each row, the pattern is I, empty, I, empty, I. Since it's a 5x5 grid, each row has 5 cells. So for each row, the I's are in columns 1, 3, 5.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the filled cells are all the I's in positions (row, column) where column is odd. Let's list them:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1:
