You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nI ▢ I ▢ I\nWhat is your next command? <sep> assistant:",

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's already partially filled with I's and empty squares. The task is to describe the filled cells step by step, only mentioning the positions of the letters (I in this case), and then wait for their next command. The example they gave earlier had commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling the last row with X. So I need to follow that structure.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: I ▢ I ▢ I\nRow 2: I ▢ I ▢ I\nRow 3: I ▢ I ▢ I\nRow 4: I ▢ I ▢ I\nRow 5: I ▢ I ▢ I\n\nEach row starts and ends with I, and the odd columns (1st, 3rd, 5th) have I's, while the even columns (2nd, 4th) are empty. So in each row, the pattern is I, empty, I, empty, I. Since it's a 5x5 grid, each row has 5 cells. So for each row, the I's are in columns 1, 3, 5.\n\nSo the filled cells are all the I's in positions (row, column) where column is odd. Let's list them:\n\nRow 1:",
