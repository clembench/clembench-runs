The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nT ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T ▢ ▢ ▢\nT T T ▢ ▢\nT T T T ▢\nT T T T T\nWhat is your next command?",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid that's already partially filled with Ts and some empty squares. They want me to describe the steps to fill this grid by specifying commands, similar to the example they gave earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the grid. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: T ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: T T ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: T T T ▢ ▢\nRow 4: T T T T ▢\nRow 5: T T T T T\n\nSo, each row starts with more Ts and the empty squares (▢) are moving to the right as the row number increases. The first row has one T and four empty squares. The second row has two Ts and three empty squares, and so on until the fifth row, which is all Ts.\n\nThe task is to describe the steps needed to create this grid from an empty one. The example given in the problem had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling a row with Xs. So, I need to figure out how to translate the existing Ts into commands that would build this grid step by step.\n\nLooking at the grid, each row i (starting from 1) has i Ts followed by (5 - i) empty squares. Wait, actually, let's check:\n\nRow 1: 1 T,",
