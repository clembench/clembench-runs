The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n▢ M ▢ M ▢\nM ▢ ▢ ▢ M\n▢ M ▢ M ▢\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

The user wants me to describe the given 5x5 grid by specifying the positions of the letters M and the empty squares (▢), but only focusing on the letters. The example they provided earlier had steps like putting an E in a specific cell and filling the last row with X. So I need to break down the given grid into commands that place the Ms step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ M ▢ M ▢\nRow 3: M ▢ ▢ ▢ M\nRow 4: ▢ M ▢ M ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n\nSo each row has Ms in certain positions. Let me check each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: The third column has an M. So that's (1,3) if we start counting from 1. But in the example, they used \"second row third column\" which would be row 2, column 3. So rows and columns are 1-indexed here.\n\nRow 2: Second column, fourth column. So (2,2) and (2,4).\n\nRow 3: First column, fifth column. (3,1) and (3,5).\n\nRow 4: Second column, fourth column. Same as row",
