	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt W W W W W\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with Ws and some empty squares. The task is to describe the steps needed to fill the grid according to the example they gave earlier. The example had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling an entire row with Xs. So I need to figure out the pattern here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the given grid:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 2: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 3: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 4: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt Row 5: W W W W W\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first four rows each start with a W, followed by four empty cells. The fifth row is all Ws. The goal is to fill the empty cells with something, but the user hasn't specified what. Wait, in the example they had E and X. Maybe the user wants to fill the empty cells with a specific symbol, but the problem statement isn't clear. Wait, the original task was to fill an empty grid, but the example given had E and X. However, in the current problem, the grid already has some Ws. Wait, maybe the user wants to complete the grid by filling the empty cells with Ws? Let me check the original problem statement again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The original task says: "The
