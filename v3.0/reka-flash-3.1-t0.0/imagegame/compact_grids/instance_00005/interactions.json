You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nW W W W W\nWhat is your next command?",

The task is to describe the steps needed to fill the grid according to the example they gave earlier. The example had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling an entire row with Xs. So I need to figure out the pattern here.\n\nLooking at the given grid:\n\nRow 1: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: W W W W W\n\nSo the first four rows each start with a W, followed by four empty cells. The fifth row is all Ws. The goal is to fill the empty cells with something, but the user hasn't specified what. Wait, in the example they had E and X. Maybe the user wants to fill the empty cells with a specific symbol, but the problem statement isn't clear. Wait, the original task was to fill an empty grid, but the example given had E and X. However, in the current problem, the grid already has some Ws. Wait, maybe the user wants to complete the grid by filling the empty cells with Ws? Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe original task says: \"The",
