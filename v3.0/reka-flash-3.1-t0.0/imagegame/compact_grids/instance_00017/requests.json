You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with R's and some empty squares (▢). They want me to describe the filled cells step by step, similar to the example they gave earlier. The example had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling a row with Xs. So, I need to figure out the positions of all the R's in the given grid and translate that into commands.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: R ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\nRow 4: R ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 5: ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\n\nEach row is separated by a line, and each cell is separated by spaces. The first row starts with R in the first column, then all empty. The second row has R in the second and fifth columns. Third row has R in the third column. Fourth row has R in the first and fourth columns. Fifth row has R in the second and fifth columns.\n\nSo, the R's are positioned as follows:\n\nRow 1: Column 1\nRow 2: Columns 2 and 5\nRow 3: Column 3\nRow 4: Columns 1 and 4\nRow 5: Columns",
