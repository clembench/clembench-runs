You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ Q Q ▢ ▢\nQ ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\n▢ ▢ Q ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ Q ▢\nWhat is your next command? <sep> assistant:",

The user provided a 5x5 grid filled with some Qs and some empty squares (▢). They want me to describe the grid step by step by giving commands that place the Qs, similar to the example they gave earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given grid and figure out where all the Qs are located. Let me write it out again to visualize:\n\nRow 1: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ Q Q ▢ ▢\nRow 3: Q ▢ ▢ ▢ Q\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ Q ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ Q ▢\n\nSo each row is separated, and the Qs are in specific positions. My task is to translate these positions into commands that place the Qs one by one or in groups. The example used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So I need to follow that style.\n\nLet me go row by row and note the positions of Qs.\n\nRow 1: The first cell is Q, others are empty. So command: Put a Q in first row first column.\n\nRow 2: Second and third columns are Q. So maybe \"Put Qs in second row second and third columns\" or two separate commands.
