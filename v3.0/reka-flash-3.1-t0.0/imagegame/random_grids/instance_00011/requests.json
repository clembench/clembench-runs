You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ U ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nU ▢ U ▢ U\n▢ U ▢ U ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command? <sep> assistant:",

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with U's and some empty squares. They want me to describe the steps to fill this grid by specifying commands, similar to the example they gave earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given grid and identify where all the U's are located. Let me visualize it:\n\nRow 1: ▢ U ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: U ▢ U ▢ U\nRow 4: ▢ U ▢ U ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo, the U's are in the following positions:\n\nRow 1: Column 2\nRow 3: Columns 1, 3, 5\nRow 4: Columns 2, 4\n\nWait, let me check again. Row 3 is U in column 1, then empty, U in column 3, empty, U in column 5. Row 4 is empty, U in column 2, empty, U in column 4, empty. Row 1 has U in column 2. The other rows (2 and 5) are all empty.\n\nSo the task is to describe the placement of these U's step by step. The example used commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\"",
