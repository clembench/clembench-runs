You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with some letters, and they want me to describe the steps to fill it by specifying commands. The example they gave earlier had commands like putting an E in a specific cell and filling a whole row with X. So I need to figure out the positions of the existing letters in the given grid and translate that into the required commands.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ R ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ R ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ R ▢ ▢ R\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo the letters are R's in specific positions. Let me note their coordinates. Let's assume rows are numbered 1 to 5 from top to bottom, and columns 1 to 5 from left to right.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The third column (since it's 0-indexed or 1-indexed? The example used \"second row third column\" which in the example grid had E in the middle. Let me check the example. The example grid had E in second row third column. The filled grid example had E in the center. Wait, the example grid was:\n\nOriginal empty grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ �",
