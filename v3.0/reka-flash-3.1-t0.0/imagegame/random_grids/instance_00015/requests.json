You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with W's and an E. The task is to describe the steps needed to fill the grid by specifying the positions of the letters, similar to the example they gave.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ W ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: W ▢ W ▢ ▢\nRow 4: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: W ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nWait, the user mentioned the filled grid example had an E and X's, but in this problem, the grid has W's and empty squares. The example steps involved placing an E and filling a row with X's. But here, the existing grid already has some W's. Wait, maybe the user wants to describe the existing grid's W positions? Or is this a different problem where the grid is empty, and the given grid is the target? Wait, the original task was to fill an empty grid, but the user provided a filled grid as an example. Now, the current problem is to describe the given grid (which has some W's) as if filling an empty grid. Wait, maybe the user is asking to describe the steps to create the given grid from an empty one. Let me check",
