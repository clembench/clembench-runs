The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nA filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\n\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X X X\n\nI want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\nM ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nM ▢ ▢ M ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\n▢ M ▢ ▢ ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

They want me to describe the steps to fill this grid by specifying commands, similar to the example they gave earlier. The example had commands like placing an E in a specific cell and filling an entire row with Xs. So, I need to figure out the positions of the Ms in the given grid and translate that into the appropriate commands.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid they provided:\n\nRow 1: M ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: M ▢ ▢ M ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ M ▢ ▢\nRow 5: ▢ M ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nSo, the Ms are located at the following positions (assuming rows and columns are 1-indexed):\n\nRow 1, Column 1: M\nRow 1, Column 2: M? Wait, no. Wait the first row is written as \"M ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\". Wait, the first row is \"M ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\", so that's M in column 1, and the rest are empty. Then row 2 is \"M ▢ ▢ M ▢\", so M in column 1 and column 4. Row 3",
