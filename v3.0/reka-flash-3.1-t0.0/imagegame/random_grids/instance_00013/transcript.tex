	 Let us do the following task. The goal is to fill an empty grid that looks like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt A filled grid below is 5 by 5 and can look like this:\\ \tt \\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ E ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt X X X X X\\ \tt \\ \tt I want you to describe this grid to me, step by step. You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with "▢". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say "What is your next command?", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say "Command: DONE". Only give the command and omit everything else.\\ \tt \\ \tt For the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\\ \tt \\ \tt Command: Put an E in second row third column\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: Fill the last row with X\\ \tt \\ \tt What is your next command?\\ \tt Command: DONE\\ \tt \\ \tt Ok. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ D D\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\\ \tt ▢ ▢ D D D\\ \tt ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt What is your next command?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with some letters: D's and an E. The task is to describe the steps needed to fill the grid by specifying the positions of the letters, similar to the example they gave.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the given grid and identify where all the letters are placed. Let me visualize it:\\ \tt \\ \tt Row 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ D D\\ \tt Row 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ D\\ \tt Row 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\\ \tt Row 4: ▢ ▢ D D D\\ \tt Row 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user mentioned that in the filled grid example, there was an E and X's. But in this problem, the grid has D's and an E? Wait, looking back at the user's message. Wait, the user provided a filled grid example where there's an E and X's, but the problem they want me to solve is a different grid. Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's instruction says: "For the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid." Then they show a grid with D's and an E? Wait, no. Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user wrote:\\ \tt \\ \tt "For the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\\ \tt ▢ ▢
