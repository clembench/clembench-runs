You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled and wants me to describe the steps to fill it, focusing only on the non-empty cells. The example given earlier had commands like placing an E and filling a row with X. So I need to figure out the positions of the R's in the given grid and translate that into commands.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid. The user wrote:\n\nRow 1: R ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ R\n\nWait, but the user's input might have formatting issues. Let me parse it correctly. Each row is separated by a line break. Let me check again:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: R ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ R ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ R\n\nWait, but the user's input shows each row as separate lines.
