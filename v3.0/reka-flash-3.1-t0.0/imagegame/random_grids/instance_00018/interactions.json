You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ D ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ D ▢ D D\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ D D ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\nWhat is your next command?",

They want me to describe the steps to fill the grid by specifying commands, each time mentioning only the positions of the letters, not the empty squares. The example given had commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\".\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given grid. Let me write it out to visualize:\n\nRow 1: ▢ D ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 2: ▢ D ▢ D D\nRow 3: D ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ D D ▢\nRow 5: ▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\n\nWait, the user's example grid is a bit different. Let me check again. The user's input grid is:\n\n▢ D ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ D ▢ D D\nD ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ D D ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ D ▢\n\nWait, but the user's example in the problem statement had an E and X's. But in this case, the grid provided has D's and some empty squares. Wait, the user's task is to describe the filled grid, but the example given in the problem statement had E and X. Wait",
