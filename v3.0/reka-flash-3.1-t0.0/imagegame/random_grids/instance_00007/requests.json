You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next command?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving commands. You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk.

The user provided a 5x5 grid that's partially filled with some Ts and a T. They want me to describe the steps to fill the grid by specifying commands, each time mentioning only the positions of the letters, not the empty squares. The example they gave earlier had commands like \"Put an E in second row third column\" and \"Fill the last row with X\". So I need to follow that pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the given grid and identify where all the Ts are. Let me visualize the grid:\n\nRow 1: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\nRow 2: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ T\nRow 3: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 4: ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nRow 5: T ▢ T T ▢\n\nSo, let's list out the positions of the Ts. \n\nIn row 1, the last column (column 5) is T. So that's (1,5).\n\nRow 2, column 5 is T: (2,5).\n\nRow 5: first column (1), third column (3), fourth column (4) are Ts. So (5,1), (5,3), (5,4).\n\nWait, let me check again. The fifth row is written as \"T ▢ T T ▢\". So",
