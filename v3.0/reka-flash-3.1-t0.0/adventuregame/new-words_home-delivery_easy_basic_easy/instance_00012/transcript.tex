	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can sious. To sious is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the unflued on the table, the plate in the pacia and the mop in the pacia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a uncest now. There are a unflued, a pillow, a bed and a pacia. The unflued is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The pacia is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the unflued on the table, the plate in the pacia, and the mop in the pacia. The user mentioned "unflued" and "pacia" which might be typos. Maybe "unflued" is supposed to be "unfueled" or "unlit"? And "pacia" could be "pantry" or "cabinet"? But I'll go with the given terms as they are.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the current room is a "uncest" which might be "uncle's" or "unrest"? Probably "uncle's" house. The items present are unflued (on the floor), pillow (on the bed), bed, and pacia (closed). There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal is to put the unflued on the table. But the initial description doesn't mention a table. Hmm. Maybe the pacia is a table? Or perhaps there's a table in the room that's not listed. Wait, the user's initial description says: "You are in a uncest now. There are a unflued, a pillow, a bed and a pacia. The unflued is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The pacia is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here."\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, so the room has a unflued (maybe a stove?),
