The current room is a bedroom with a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to the hallway. The problem is that the items mentioned (mical, mop, broom) aren't listed here. Maybe they're in the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so I should open it to check.\n\nSo first action: open wardrobe. Let's do that. Once the wardrobe is open, maybe there are the items inside. Then, after getting them, I need to take them to the pante. Wait, where is the pante? The description mentions a pante, but I don't see it in the current room. Maybe the pante is in the hallway? Or perhaps it's a typo? Wait, the user wrote \"pante\" but maybe they meant \"pantry\"? Or maybe \"pante\" is a specific object in the game. Let me check the initial description again.\n\nThe user's goal is to put the mical, mop, and broom on the pante. The current room has a passage to the hallway. So maybe the pante is in the hallway?
