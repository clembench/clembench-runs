To inate is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the mical on the pante, the mop on the pante and the broom on the pante.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the mical, mop, and broom on the pante. First, I need to figure out where these items are. The current room is a bedroom with a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to the hallway. The problem is that the items mentioned (mical, mop, broom) aren't listed here. Maybe they're in the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so I should open it to check.\\ \tt \\ \tt So first action: open wardrobe. Let's do that. Once the wardrobe is open, maybe there are the items inside. Then, after getting them, I need to take them to the pante. Wait, where is the pante? The description mentions a pante, but I don't see it in the current room. Maybe the pante is in the hallway? Or perhaps it's a typo? Wait, the user wrote "pante" but maybe they meant "pantry"? Or maybe "pante" is a specific object in the game. Let me check the initial description again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user's goal is to put the mical, mop, and broom on the pante. The current room has a passage to the hallway. So maybe the pante is in the hallway? Or perhaps the pante is an object in the bedroom that's not mentioned yet. Wait, the initial description says "the mical on the pante, the mop
