The current room is a bedroom. The description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to a hallway. The user hasn't mentioned a table, mop, broom, or micon yet. Maybe those items are in the hallway or another room?\n\nWait, the initial description only lists the items in the bedroom. The passage to the hallway is present. So perhaps I need to go to the hallway to find the required items. Let me check the possible actions. The user can move to the hallway via the passage. So first step: go to the hallway.\n\nOnce in the hallway, I need to look for the table, mop, broom, and micon. The goal is to place the mop and broom on the micon. Wait, the micon is mentioned here. Maybe it's a typo? Like \"microwave\" or \"micon\" is a specific object in the game. The user might have intended \"micon\" as a specific item. So I need to find the micon, then put the mop and broom on it. Also, the penol needs to be on the table. So first, find the table, then the penol, then place it there. Then find",
