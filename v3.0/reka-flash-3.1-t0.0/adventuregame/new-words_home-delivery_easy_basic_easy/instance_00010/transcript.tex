	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can fress. To fress is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the penol on the table, the mop on the micon and the broom on the micon.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a wardrobe and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the penol on the table, the mop on the micon, and the broom on the micon. First, I need to figure out where these items are. The current room is a bedroom. The description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to a hallway. The user hasn't mentioned a table, mop, broom, or micon yet. Maybe those items are in the hallway or another room?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description only lists the items in the bedroom. The passage to the hallway is present. So perhaps I need to go to the hallway to find the required items. Let me check the possible actions. The user can move to the hallway via the passage. So first step: go to the hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once in the hallway, I need to look for the table, mop, broom, and micon. The goal is to place the mop and broom on the micon. Wait, the micon is mentioned here. Maybe it's a typo? Like "microwave" or "micon" is a specific object in the game. The user might have intended "micon" as a specific item. So I need to find the micon, then put the mop and broom on it. Also, the penol needs to be on the table. So first, find the table, then the penol, then place it there. Then find
