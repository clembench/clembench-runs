First, I need to figure out where these items are. The current room is a bedroom. The description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to a hallway. The user hasn't mentioned a table, mop, broom, or micon yet. Maybe those items are in the hallway or another room?\n\nWait, the initial description only lists the items in the bedroom.

So I need to find the micon, then put the mop and broom on it. Also, the penol needs to be on the table. So first, find the table, then the penol, then place it there. Then find",
