	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can stism. To stism is to remove or block an opening of something, and make its contents unavailable for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the nond on the table, the orange in the torish and the banana in the torish.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a torish and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a imped here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the "nond" on the table, the orange in the torish, and the banana in the torish. First, I need to figure out what each of these items are. The description mentions a pillow, a bed, a torish, a book, and a passage to a imped. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions "nond," "orange," and "banana." But in the current room, I don't see an orange or a banana. The items listed are pillow, bed, torish, book. Maybe "nond" is a typo or a mishearing? Or perhaps "nond" is an item that's not listed here. Wait, maybe "nond" is supposed to be "pillow"? Because the pillow is on the bed. Let me check the original problem again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal is: Put the nond on the table, the orange in the torish and the banana in the torish. Hmm. The current room has a pillow, bed, torish, book. No table mentioned. Wait, the user said "You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a torish and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a imped here
