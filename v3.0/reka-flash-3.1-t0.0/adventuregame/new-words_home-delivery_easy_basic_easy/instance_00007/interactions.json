First, I need to figure out what each of these items are. The description mentions a pillow, a bed, a torish, a book, and a passage to a imped. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed.\n\nWait, the goal mentions \"nond,\" \"orange,\" and \"banana.\" But in the current room, I don't see an orange or a banana. The items listed are pillow, bed, torish, book. Maybe \"nond\" is a typo or a mishearing? Or perhaps \"nond\" is an item that's not listed here. Wait, maybe \"nond\" is supposed to be \"pillow\"? Because the pillow is on the bed. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe goal is: Put the nond on the table, the orange in the torish and the banana in the torish. Hmm. The current room has a pillow, bed, torish, book. No table mentioned. Wait, the user said \"You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a torish and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The torish is closed. The book is on the floor.
