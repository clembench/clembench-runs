	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can ortid. To ortid is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism and the plate on the alism.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a book and a enerk. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The enerk is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism, and the plate on the alism. The user mentioned that the alism is a place or object here. The current room is a bedroom with a bed, wardrobe, book, enerk, and a passage to the hallway. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor, enerk is on the bed.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description says "the book on the floor" and "enerk on the bed". But the goal is to put the book on the alism and the plate on the alism. Wait, but the current items are book and enerk. Where's the plate? Maybe the alism is a table or another object that's not mentioned yet. Or perhaps "alism" is a typo? Or maybe it's a specific object in the game. The user might have made a typo, but I have to go with what's given.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's goal is: Put the enerk on the table, the book on the alism and the plate on the alism. So three items: enerk on table, book on alism, plate on alism. But in the current room, the items present are book, enerk, bed, wardrobe. The passage to the hallway. So where is the table and alism? Maybe the table is part of the room but not mentioned?
