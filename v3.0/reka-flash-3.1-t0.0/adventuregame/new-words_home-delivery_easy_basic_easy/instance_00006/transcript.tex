	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tratel. To tratel is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the unpish on the table, the plate on the secti and the mop on the secti.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a nolog now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a unpish and a pillow. The wardrobe is closed. The unpish is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the unpish on the table, the plate on the secti, and the mop on the secti. The problem is, the current room description doesn't mention a table, secti, or mop. The items present are a bed, wardrobe, unpish, and pillow. There's also a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe the secti is a typo? Or perhaps it's an object that's not listed here. The user mentioned "secti" but I don't see it in the current room. The unpish is on the floor, and the pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The table and mop aren't here. So maybe I need to go to the hallway to find those items?\\ \tt \\ \tt The passage to the hallway is present. So first, I should go to the hallway to see if there's a table, secti, or mop there. Let me check the initial description again. The user said "You are in a nolog now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a unpish and a pillow. The wardrobe is closed. The unpish is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here." So the hallway is accessible. So the first step is to move to the hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once in the hallway, maybe there's a table, secti, and mop. The goal requires placing the plate on the
