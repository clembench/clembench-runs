	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can aphon. To aphon is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord and the mop on the stord.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a enticed now. There are a wardrobe, a pillow, a bed and a decte. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The decte is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the decte on the table, the plate on the stord, and the mop on the stord. First, I need to check what's in the current room. The description says I'm in an enticed now. There's a wardrobe, a pillow, a bed, and a decte. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The decte is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway here.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions a table, stord, and mop. But in the current room, I don't see a table, stord, or mop. The items present are wardrobe, pillow, bed, decte. Maybe the table and stord are in another room, like the hallway? Or perhaps "stord" is a typo for "store" or "storage"? The mop might be in the wardrobe since it's closed. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the decte needs to be on the table. But there's no table here. Maybe the table is in the hallway? The passage to the hallway is present. So I need to go to the hallway to find the table. But before moving, maybe check the wardrobe. The wardrobe is closed. Could the mop be inside? If I open the wardrobe, maybe there's a mop there. But the goal is to put the mop on the stord. So perhaps the
