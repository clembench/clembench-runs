The current room is a tuat, which I assume is a typo for \"tutu\" or maybe \"room\"? The description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to a hallway. But the items needed are lator, mop, broom, and table. The initial description doesn't list these. Maybe the user made a typo? Let me check again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Your goal for this game is: Put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper and the broom on the comper.\" Wait, \"lator\" might be a typo for \"ladder\"? Or maybe \"lator\" is a specific item in the game. \"Comper\" is unclear. Maybe \"computer\"? But the initial room description has a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and passage. So perhaps the items mentioned in the goal are not present in the starting room. That suggests I might need to move to another area, like the hallway, to find these items.\n\nWait, the user's initial description says: \"You are in a tuat now.
