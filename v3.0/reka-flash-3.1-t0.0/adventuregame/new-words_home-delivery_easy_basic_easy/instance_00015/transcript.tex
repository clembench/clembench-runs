To comess is to physically place something somewhere.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper and the broom on the comper.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a tuat now.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper, and the broom on the comper. First, I need to figure out where these items are. The current room is a tuat, which I assume is a typo for "tutu" or maybe "room"? The description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to a hallway. But the items needed are lator, mop, broom, and table. The initial description doesn't list these. Maybe the user made a typo? Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user wrote: "Your goal for this game is: Put the lator on the table, the mop on the comper and the broom on the comper." Wait, "lator" might be a typo for "ladder"? Or maybe "lator" is a specific item in the game. "Comper" is unclear. Maybe "computer"? But the initial room description has a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and passage. So perhaps the items mentioned in the goal are not present in the starting room. That suggests I might need to move to another area, like the hallway, to find these items.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's initial description says: "You are in a tuat now. There are a pillow, a bed, a wardrobe and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The
