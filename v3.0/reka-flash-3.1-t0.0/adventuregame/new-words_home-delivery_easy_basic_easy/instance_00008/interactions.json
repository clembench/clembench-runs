The current room is a bedroom with a pillow on the bed, a closed wardrobe, a book on the floor, and a passage to the hallway. The user mentioned \"aling\" but I don't see that in the initial description. Maybe \"aling\" is a typo? Or perhaps it's a specific location in the game that I haven't encountered yet. Let me check the initial description again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Your goal for this game is: Put the nogia on the table, the potted plant in the aling and the peach in the aling.\" Wait, \"aling\" is mentioned twice. Maybe that's a typo for \"aling\" or \"aling\" is a specific place. Alternatively, maybe \"aling\" is supposed to be \"aling\" (like a balcony or another room). But in the current room description, there's a passage to the hallway. So perhaps the aling is another room connected via the hallway? Or maybe \"aling\" is a typo for \"aling\" (like a shelf or a specific spot). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the current room has a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to the hallway. The items needed",
