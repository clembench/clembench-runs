Maybe that's a typo for \"aling\" or \"aling\" is a specific place. Alternatively, maybe \"aling\" is supposed to be \"aling\" (like a balcony or another room). But in the current room description, there's a passage to the hallway. So perhaps the aling is another room connected via the hallway? Or maybe \"aling\" is a typo for \"aling\" (like a shelf or a specific spot). Hmm, this is confusing.
