The user mentioned \"derman\" but I don't see that in the current room description. The current room has a bed, wardrobe, book, ramiced, and a passage to the hallway. Maybe \"derman\" is a typo? Or perhaps it's an object that's not mentioned yet. Let me check the initial description again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"Your goal for this game is: Put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman and the plate on the derman.\" Wait, the ramiced is on the bed, the book is on the floor. But there's no table, derman, or plate mentioned in the current room. The room has a bed, wardrobe, book, ramiced, and a passage to the hallway. So maybe the table and derman are in the hallway? Or perhaps \"derman\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"derman\" is a typo for \"drawer\" or \"table\"? Or maybe \"derman\" is a specific object that's part of the wardrobe? Let me think.\n\nWait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe inside the wardrobe there's a table or derman? Or perhaps the derman is another piece of furniture. Alternatively, maybe \"derman\" is a misspelling",
