	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can tedne. To tedne is to get something into one's hands, possession or control.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman and the plate on the derman.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a book and a ramiced. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The ramiced is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman, and the plate on the derman. The user mentioned "derman" but I don't see that in the current room description. The current room has a bed, wardrobe, book, ramiced, and a passage to the hallway. Maybe "derman" is a typo? Or perhaps it's an object that's not mentioned yet. Let me check the initial description again.\\ \tt \\ \tt The user wrote: "Your goal for this game is: Put the ramiced on the table, the book on the derman and the plate on the derman." Wait, the ramiced is on the bed, the book is on the floor. But there's no table, derman, or plate mentioned in the current room. The room has a bed, wardrobe, book, ramiced, and a passage to the hallway. So maybe the table and derman are in the hallway? Or perhaps "derman" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe "derman" is a typo for "drawer" or "table"? Or maybe "derman" is a specific object that's part of the wardrobe? Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe inside the wardrobe there's a table or derman? Or perhaps the derman is another piece of furniture. Alternatively, maybe "derman" is a misspelling
