The current room is a bedroom with a pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and a passage to the hallway. The problem is that the items mentioned (ousnee, potted plant, peach) aren't listed here. Maybe they're in the wardrobe? The wardrobe is closed, so I need to open it to check.\n\nSo first action: open the wardrobe. Let's do that. Once it's open, maybe the ousnee, potted plant, and peach are inside. Then I can take them out. But wait, the table and delly aren't mentioned either. The current room has a bed, pillow, wardrobe, book, and passage. Maybe the table and delly are in the hallway? The passage leads to the hallway, so I might need to go there. But the goal is to put items on the table and delly. So perhaps the table and delly are in the hallway. Let me think.\n\nWait, the user's initial description says \"You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a wardrobe and a book. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.\" So",
