Maybe the plate is somewhere else, like in the hallway? Or perhaps it's a typo? The user might have made a mistake, but I should proceed with the given information.\n\nFirst, I need to check what's in the room. The book is on the floor, the menny is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The reele isn't mentioned here. Wait, the goal is to put things on the reele, but where is the reele located? The current room is the bedroom. Maybe the reele is in the wardrobe? Or perhaps the reele is in the hallway? The passage is to the hallway, so maybe I need to go there first.\n\nWait, the user's initial description says \"You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a book and a menny. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The menny is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.\" So the reele isn't mentioned here. Maybe the reele is in the wardrobe?
