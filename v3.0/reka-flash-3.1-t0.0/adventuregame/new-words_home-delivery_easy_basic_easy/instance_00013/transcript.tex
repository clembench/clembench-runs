	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can prust. To prust is to get something into one's hands, possession or control.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the menny on the reele, the book on the reele and the plate on the reele.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a book and a menny. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The menny is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the menny, the book, and the plate on the reele. The user mentioned a plate, but looking at the current description, there's no plate in the bedroom. The items here are a bed, wardrobe, book, menny, and a passage to the hallway. Maybe the plate is somewhere else, like in the hallway? Or perhaps it's a typo? The user might have made a mistake, but I should proceed with the given information.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to check what's in the room. The book is on the floor, the menny is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The reele isn't mentioned here. Wait, the goal is to put things on the reele, but where is the reele located? The current room is the bedroom. Maybe the reele is in the wardrobe? Or perhaps the reele is in the hallway? The passage is to the hallway, so maybe I need to go there first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's initial description says "You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a book and a menny. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The menny is on the bed. There is a passage to a hallway here." So the reele isn't mentioned here. Maybe the reele is in the wardrobe? Or perhaps the reele is in the hallway. Since the goal
