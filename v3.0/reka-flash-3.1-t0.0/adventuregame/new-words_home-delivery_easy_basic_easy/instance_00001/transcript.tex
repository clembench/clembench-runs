	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can diale. To diale is to make something physically unobstructed and uncovered, and make its contents available for use or interaction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the subst on the table, the book on the scont and the plate on the scont.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a subst and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The subst is on the bed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the subst on the table, the book on the scont, and the plate on the scont. The user mentioned "scont" but I'm not sure what that refers to. Maybe it's a typo? Let me check the initial description again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking back: "the book on the scont and the plate on the scont." Hmm, maybe "scont" is a specific object in the game. Wait, the current room is a bedroom with a bed, wardrobe, subst, and book. The wardrobe is closed. The subst is on the bed, the book is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway. Wait, but the goal mentions a table and a plate. The current room doesn't have a table or a plate. So maybe I need to go to the hallway?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description says "You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a wardrobe, a subst and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The subst is on the bed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here." So the bedroom has a bed, wardrobe, subst (maybe "subst" is a typo for "stuff" or another object?), book. The hallway is accessible via passage. But the goal requires a table and a plate. So perhaps the hallway has those items?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user's goal is to put the subst on the
