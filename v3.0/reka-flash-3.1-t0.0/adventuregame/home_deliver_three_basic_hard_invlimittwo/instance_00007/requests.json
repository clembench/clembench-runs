The goal is to put the potted plant in the freezer, the plate on the table, and the mop in the refrigerator. But right now, I'm in the bedroom. The initial description says there's a pillow, a bed, and a wardrobe. The pillow is in the wardrobe, which is closed. There's a passage to the hallway.\n\nWait, but the items needed for the goals aren't mentioned here. The potted plant, plate, and mop aren't in the bedroom. So maybe I need to go to the hallway first. Let me check the possible actions. Since the wardrobe is closed, maybe I can open it to get the pillow? But the pillow is already in the wardrobe. Wait, the description says \"The pillow is in the wardrobe. The wardrobe is closed.\" So maybe the pillow is inside the wardrobe. But why is that relevant? The goal isn't about the pillow. Hmm.\n\nSo the first step is probably to move to the hallway. The passage is here, so I can go to the hallway. Let me try that. So action: > go to hallway. That makes sense. Let's see what's in the hallway. Maybe there are other rooms connected, like the kitchen or freezer? Wait, the goals mention freezer and refrigerator. So maybe the hallway connects to those areas. Let's assume that moving to the hallway will let me access other rooms. So first, go to the hallway.\n\nOnce",
