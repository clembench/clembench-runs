	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the book on the shelf, the sandwich on the table and the broom on the counter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a shelf, a couch, a side table and a chair. There are passages to a bedroom, a kitchen and a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the book on the shelf, the sandwich on the table, and the broom on the counter. Right now, I'm in the living room. The objects here are a shelf, couch, side table, chair, and passages to bedroom, kitchen, hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to check if there are any items in the living room that I can pick up. The problem mentions the book, sandwich, and broom, but where are they located? The initial description doesn't mention them. Maybe I need to explore other rooms to find them. Let me think. The passages are to bedroom, kitchen, and hallway. Let's check those.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting with the kitchen. If I go to the kitchen, maybe there's a sandwich on the table. The goal is to put the sandwich on the table, but wait, the kitchen has a table? Or is the side table in the living room the one? Wait, the goal says "the sandwich on the table"â€”probably the side table in the living room? Or maybe the kitchen has a table. The problem statement isn't clear. Hmm. Wait, the user's goal is to put the sandwich on the table. The initial description in the living room mentions a side table. So maybe the sandwich is somewhere else, like the kitchen, and needs to be moved to the side table. Or maybe the sandwich is on the side table already, but I need to confirm
