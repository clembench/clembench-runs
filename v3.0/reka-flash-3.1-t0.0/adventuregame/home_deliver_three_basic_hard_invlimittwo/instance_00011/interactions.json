The objects here are a shelf, couch, side table, chair, and passages to bedroom, kitchen, hallway.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any items in the living room that I can pick up. The problem mentions the book, sandwich, and broom, but where are they located? The initial description doesn't mention them. Maybe I need to explore other rooms to find them. Let me think. The passages are to bedroom, kitchen, and hallway. Let's check those.\n\nStarting with the kitchen. If I go to the kitchen, maybe there's a sandwich on the table. The goal is to put the sandwich on the table, but wait, the kitchen has a table? Or is the side table in the living room the one? Wait, the goal says \"the sandwich on the table\"â€”probably the side table in the living room? Or maybe the kitchen has a table. The problem statement isn't clear. Hmm. Wait, the user's goal is to put the sandwich on the table. The initial description in the living room mentions a side table. So maybe the sandwich is somewhere else, like the kitchen, and needs to be moved to the side table. Or maybe the sandwich is on the side table already, but I need to confirm",
