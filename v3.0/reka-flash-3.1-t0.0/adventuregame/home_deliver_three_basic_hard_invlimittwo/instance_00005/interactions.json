The mop is here, but the goal is to put the mop on the table. Wait, but the current location is the broom closet. There's no table here. So maybe I need to go to another room where there's a table. The passage leads to the hallway. Let me go there first.\n\nSo the first action should be to move to the hallway. Let me check if there's anything else in the broom closet. The broom and mop are on the floor. Since I can carry two objects, but the mop is here. Wait, the goal is to put the mop on the table. So maybe I need to take the mop with me? But the table is probably in another room. Let me go to the hallway first.\n\nSo action: > go to hallway\n</reasoning>\n\n> go to hallway\n\n <sep> human:",
