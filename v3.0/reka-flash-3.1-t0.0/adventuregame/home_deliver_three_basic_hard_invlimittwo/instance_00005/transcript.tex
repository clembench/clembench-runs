	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the sandwich in the freezer, the book in the wardrobe and the mop on the table.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a broom closet now. There are a broom and a mop. The broom is on the floor. The mop is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the sandwich in the freezer, the book in the wardrobe, and the mop on the table. Right now, I'm in the broom closet. The items here are a broom and a mop, both on the floor. There's a passage to the hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to check if the items I need to move are here. The mop is here, but the goal is to put the mop on the table. Wait, but the current location is the broom closet. There's no table here. So maybe I need to go to another room where there's a table. The passage leads to the hallway. Let me go there first.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the first action should be to move to the hallway. Let me check if there's anything else in the broom closet. The broom and mop are on the floor. Since I can carry two objects, but the mop is here. Wait, the goal is to put the mop on the table. So maybe I need to take the mop with me? But the table is probably in another room. Let me go to the hallway first.\\ \tt \\ \tt So action: > go to hallway\\ \tt </reasoning>\\ \tt \\ \tt > go to hallway\\ \tt \\ \tt  <sep> human:
