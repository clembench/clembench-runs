The items here are apple, banana, freezer, orange, refrigerator, peach, sandwich, and a passage to the kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe the potted plant and the book are in another room? The passage to the kitchen is here. So maybe I need to go to the kitchen first to find those items. But the current room is the pantry. Let me check the initial description again. The user says, "You are in a pantry now. There are a apple, a banana, a freezer, a orange, a refrigerator, a peach and a sandwich. The apple is in the refrigerator. The banana is in the refrigerator. The freezer is closed. The orange is in the refrigerator. The refrigerator is closed. The peach is in the refrigerator. The sandwich is in the refrigerator. There is a passage to a kitchen here."\\ \tt \\ \tt So in the pantry, the items are listed, but the potted plant and book aren't here. So perhaps the potted plant and book are in the kitchen? Or maybe they were mentioned earlier? Wait, the user hasn't mentioned them yet. Wait, the initial problem statement says the goal is to put the potted plant in the cupboard, the
