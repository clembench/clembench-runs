So first, I need to get to other areas where the freezer, side table, and table are located. But the initial description only mentions the broom closet and the hallway. Maybe the hallway connects to other rooms? The problem is that the user hasn't provided details about other rooms yet. Wait, the user is describing the game state, so perhaps each action will reveal new information. \n\nWait, the user is going to describe what I can perceive in the game, and I have to write actions.

Let me check the initial description again.\n\nThe player is in the broom closet. There's a passage to a hallway. So the first action should be to go to the hallway. Let me do that.
