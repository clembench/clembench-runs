The initial description mentions a pillow, bed, wardrobe, and a passage to the hallway. The wardrobe is closed, and the pillow is inside it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the other items (sandwich, plate, mop) are located. Since the user hasn't mentioned them yet, maybe they're in other rooms. The passage to the hallway is here, so I should probably go there to explore more. Let me check the bedroom again. The objects here are pillow, bed, wardrobe (closed), and the passage. The wardrobe has the pillow, but it's closed. So maybe I need to open the wardrobe first to get the pillow? But the goal isn't to get the pillow; the goals are about sandwich, plate, mop. So maybe the other items are in the hallway or other rooms connected to it.\n\nWait, the user hasn't described other rooms yet. The initial state is the bedroom. So perhaps the first step is to move to the hallway via the passage. Let me go there. So action: > go to hallway.\n\nOnce in the hallway, I can look around. Maybe there are more objects there. The user will describe what's there. Let's assume that in the hallway, there might be a freezer, a shelf,",
