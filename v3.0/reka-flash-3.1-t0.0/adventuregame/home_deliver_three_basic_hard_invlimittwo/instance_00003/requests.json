Wait, the current room has a table, but the goal is to put the plate on the side table. Maybe the side table is in another room? Or perhaps the table here is the side table?

Once in the kitchen, I can look for the apple and the freezer. The freezer is likely there. Also, the mop might be in the kitchen, maybe hanging on a shelf or in a cabinet. The plate might be in the kitchen too, perhaps on a counter or in a drawer. But the goal is to put the plate on the side table. Wait,",
