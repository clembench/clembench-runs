	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table and the mop on the shelf.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a table, a chair and a book. The book is on the table. There are passages to a bedroom and a kitchen here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the apple in the freezer, the plate on the side table, and the mop on the shelf. First, I need to figure out where these items are located.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room is the living room. The description mentions a couch, table, chair, and a book on the table. There are passages to a bedroom and a kitchen. So, the apple, plate, and mop might be in different rooms. Let me think: the freezer is probably in the kitchen, since that's where appliances are. The side tableâ€”maybe that's in the living room? Wait, the current room has a table, but the goal is to put the plate on the side table. Maybe the side table is in another room? Or perhaps the table here is the side table? The description says "the table" but the goal is "the side table." Maybe the side table is a different one. Hmm, maybe I need to check other rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt The kitchen is accessible from the living room. Let me go there first. So, action: go to kitchen. Once in the kitchen, I can look for the apple and the freezer. The freezer is likely there. Also, the mop might be in the kitchen, maybe hanging on a shelf or in a cabinet. The plate might be in the kitchen too, perhaps on a counter or in a drawer. But the goal is to put the plate on the side table. Wait,
