The objects here are a cupboard, a counter, and a plate. The cupboard is closed, and the plate is inside it. There are passages to the pantry, living room, and hallway.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out where the sandwich, book, and mop are. The initial description doesn't mention them here. So maybe they're in other rooms. The passages lead to pantry, living room, and hallway. Let me check each room one by one.\n\nStarting with the pantry. If I go to the pantry, maybe there's the sandwich or the mop. The book might be in the living room or hallway. Let me try moving to the pantry first. So action: > go to pantry.\n\nWait, but the user said I can have up to two objects in inventory. So maybe I need to pick up items as I go. Let's see. In the kitchen, the cupboard is closed, plate is inside. If I open the cupboard, maybe I can get the plate, but the goal isn't to put the plate anywhere. The goals are sandwich on side table, book on shelf, mop in cupboard. So maybe the plate is irrelevant here. But the cupboard is closed, so maybe I need to open it first? But why?
