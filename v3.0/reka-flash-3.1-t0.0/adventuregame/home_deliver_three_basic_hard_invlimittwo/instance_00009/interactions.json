The initial description says there's an apple, banana, freezer, orange, refrigerator, peach, and sandwich. The apple is in the refrigerator. The banana, orange, peach, and sandwich are also in the refrigerator. The freezer is closed. There's a passage to the kitchen.\n\nWait, but the book and broom aren't mentioned here. The problem says the book needs to go in the wardrobe and the broom in the freezer. But in the pantry, I don't see a book or broom. Maybe they're in the kitchen? The passage is to the kitchen, so maybe I need to go there first to get those items. But the current goal is to move the apple, book, and broom. Let me check the initial state again.\n\nThe user's goal is: Put the apple in the cupboard, the book in the wardrobe, and the broom in the freezer. So the apple is currently in the refrigerator. The cupboard isn't mentioned here. Wait, the pantry has a refrigerator, freezer, and passage to kitchen. The cupboard might be in the kitchen? Or maybe the cupboard is in the pantry but not mentioned? Wait, the initial description says \"You are in a pantry now. There are a apple, a banana, a freezer",
