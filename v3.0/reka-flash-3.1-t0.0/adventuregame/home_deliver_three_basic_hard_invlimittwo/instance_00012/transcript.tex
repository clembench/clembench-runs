	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the pillow in the freezer, the broom on the bed, and the plate on the table. Right now, I'm in the hallway. The initial description says there's a potted plant on the floor here. The passages lead to a broom closet, living room, and kitchen.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to figure out where each item is located. The pillow, broom, and plate aren't mentioned in the hallway.

So maybe I should go there first to get the broom. But the goal is to put the broom on the bed, which is probably in the living room or another room. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the hallway has passages to broom closet, living room, and kitchen. Let me think. The broom is likely in the broom closet. So I should go to the broom closet, take the broom, then go to the bed (maybe in the living room?), and place the broom there. But I can only carry two items at a time. Wait, the user said "You can have up to two objects in your inventory at the same time." So I need to manage that.\\ \tt \\ \tt But first, let's check each room. Let's start with the
