The player is in a broom closet with a broom and a mop on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway. The inventory can hold up to two objects.\n\nFirst, I need to move to the hallway to access other areas where the counter, shelf, and table might be. So the first action should be to go to the hallway. Let me check the example given: \"open cupboard\" is an action. So moving would be something like \"> go to hallway\".\n\nOnce in the hallway, where else can I go? The problem mentions a counter, shelf, and table, which are likely in different rooms. Maybe the hallway connects to other rooms like a kitchen, living room, etc. But since the initial description only mentions the broom closet and the hallway, perhaps I need to explore further. Wait, the user hasn't provided details about other rooms yet. Maybe the game will describe them as I move. So first step: go to hallway.\n\nIn the hallway, I might find doors or passages to other areas. Let's assume there's a door to a kitchen (where the counter and table might be) and another to a living room (where the shelf and pillow could be). But without knowing the exact layout, I need to proceed step by step.",
