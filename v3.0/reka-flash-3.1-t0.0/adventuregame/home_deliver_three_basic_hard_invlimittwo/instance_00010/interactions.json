The initial description says there's a cupboard, counter, plate, and table. The cupboard is closed, and the plate is inside it. Passages lead to pantry, living room, and hallway.\n\nWait, but the first goal item is the potted plant on the side table. But the current room's description doesn't mention a potted plant or a side table. Hmm. Maybe the side table is the same as the table mentioned? Or maybe the side table is in another room.

There are passages to a pantry, a living room and a hallway here.\" So the table is here, but it's called a table, not a side table. Maybe the side table is in another room? Or perhaps the user made a typo. Wait, the goal is to put the potted plant on the side table. But in the current room, there's a table. Maybe the side table is the same as the table here.
