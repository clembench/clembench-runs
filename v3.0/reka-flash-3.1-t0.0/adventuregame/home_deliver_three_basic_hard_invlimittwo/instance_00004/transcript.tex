	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the pillow in the refrigerator, the book in the wardrobe, and the plate on the shelf. Right now, I'm in the living room. The objects here are a couch, side table, table, and chair. There's a passage to the hallway. So first, I need to figure out where the refrigerator, wardrobe, and shelf are. Since the passage is to the hallway, maybe those items are there. But I don't know yet. Let me check the living room first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description doesn't mention the refrigerator, wardrobe, or shelf. So maybe I need to move to the hallway. Let me go there. So the first action should be to go to the hallway. Let me type "> go to hallway". That makes sense. Once in the hallway, I can look around for those items. But the problem is, the user hasn't described the hallway yet. Wait, the user will describe what I can perceive each time I take an action. So when I go to the hallway, the next description will tell me what's there. So I need to proceed step by step.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator, wardrobe, and shelf are in the living room but not mentioned yet. Wait, the initial description says "You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a side table, a table and a chair. There is a passage to a hallway here." So the only
