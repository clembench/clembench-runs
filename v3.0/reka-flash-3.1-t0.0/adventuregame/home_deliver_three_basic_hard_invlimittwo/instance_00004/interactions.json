The objects here are a couch, side table, table, and chair. There's a passage to the hallway. So first, I need to figure out where the refrigerator, wardrobe, and shelf are. Since the passage is to the hallway, maybe those items are there. But I don't know yet. Let me check the living room first.\n\nWait, the initial description doesn't mention the refrigerator, wardrobe, or shelf. So maybe I need to move to the hallway. Let me go there. So the first action should be to go to the hallway. Let me type \"> go to hallway\". That makes sense. Once in the hallway, I can look around for those items. But the problem is, the user hasn't described the hallway yet. Wait, the user will describe what I can perceive each time I take an action. So when I go to the hallway, the next description will tell me what's there. So I need to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the refrigerator, wardrobe, and shelf are in the living room but not mentioned yet. Wait, the initial description says \"You are in a living room now. There are a couch, a side table, a table and a chair. There is a passage to a hallway here.\" So the only",
