	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a bed, a wardrobe, a pillow, a potion recipe and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the floor. The potion recipe is on the bed. The book is on the bed. There is a passage to a reading room here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to brew a potion following the recipe. Let me look around the bedroom. The items mentioned are a bed, wardrobe, pillow, potion recipe, book, and a passage to the reading room.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the potion recipe is on the bed. So maybe I should pick that up to read the ingredients and steps. But wait, the user said I can have up to two objects in inventory. The recipe is on the bed, so I can take it. Let me check if the bed is interactable. The description says the recipe is on the bed, so probably I can take it. So action: take potion recipe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once I have the recipe, I need to gather the ingredients. The recipe might list what's needed. But the current room has a pillow, wardrobe, book. Maybe the ingredients are in the wardrobe or elsewhere. Wait, the wardrobe is closed. Maybe it contains something useful. The book is on the bed, but not sure if it's related. The pillow is on the floor, maybe not useful unless the recipe needs something from it. But the passage is to a reading room, maybe that's where other items are. But the user hasn't mentioned other rooms yet. Wait, the current room is the bedroom with the passage to the reading room. So maybe I need to go to the reading room to get more ingredients? But the problem is, the user hasn't described the reading room yet. So perhaps the ingredients are in
