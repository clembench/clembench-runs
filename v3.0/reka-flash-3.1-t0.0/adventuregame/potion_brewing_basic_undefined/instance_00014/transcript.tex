	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

There are a bed, a wardrobe, a pillow, a potion recipe and a book. The wardrobe is closed. The pillow is on the floor. The potion recipe is on the bed. The book is on the bed. There is a passage to a reading room here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to brew a potion following the recipe. Let me look around the bedroom. The recipe is on the bed, so first I should probably pick it up. The book is also on the bed. Maybe the book has some useful information or ingredients? The wardrobe is closed; maybe there are ingredients inside? The pillow is on the floor, but I don't know if that's relevant yet.\\ \tt \\ \tt First step: get the recipe. So I should take the potion recipe. Let me check if there's any action needed to get it. The description says the recipe is on the bed. So maybe I can just take it. Let me try that. Once I have the recipe, I can check what ingredients I need. Then I need to find those ingredients in the room. The wardrobe might have some, or maybe the book has a list. Wait, the book is on the bed too. Maybe the book is a spellbook or something related to potions. But the goal is to brew a potion, so maybe the recipe is the main thing. Let me start by taking the recipe.\\ \tt \\ \tt So action: take potion recipe. Then read it to see what's needed. Let's assume the recipe lists ingredients like herbs, a cauldron, maybe some tools. Wait, but in this room, are there any tools? The description mentions a bed, wardrobe, pillow, recipe, book. No cauldron here. Maybe I need to go to another room? The
