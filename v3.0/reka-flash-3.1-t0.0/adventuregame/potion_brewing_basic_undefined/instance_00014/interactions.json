The book is also on the bed. Maybe the book has some useful information or ingredients? The wardrobe is closed; maybe there are ingredients inside? The pillow is on the floor, but I don't know if that's relevant yet.\n\nFirst step: get the recipe. So I should take the potion recipe. Let me check if there's any action needed to get it. The description says the recipe is on the bed. So maybe I can just take it. Let me try that. Once I have the recipe, I can check what ingredients I need. Then I need to find those ingredients in the room. The wardrobe might have some, or maybe the book has a list. Wait, the book is on the bed too. Maybe the book is a spellbook or something related to potions. But the goal is to brew a potion, so maybe the recipe is the main thing. Let me start by taking the recipe.\n\nSo action: take potion recipe. Then read it to see what's needed. Let's assume the recipe lists ingredients like herbs, a cauldron, maybe some tools. Wait, but in this room, are there any tools? The description mentions a bed, wardrobe, pillow, recipe, book. No cauldron here. Maybe I need to go to another room? The",
