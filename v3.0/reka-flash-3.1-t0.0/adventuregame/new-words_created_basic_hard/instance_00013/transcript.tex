	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can alitst, lophante, rhypnon, ophabor, ompous and hoadve.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal and the mituark mationymb.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a heccop now. There are a inagness, a asceles, a otioct, a ctaticed, a horbact and a mituark. There is a passage to a trapseng here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's try to figure out how to solve this game. The goal is to make the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal, and the mituark mationymb. First, I need to understand what these terms mean. Maybe they are objects or creatures in the game that need to be transformed or modified.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room: there's a heccop. The items present are a inagness, asceles, otioct, ctaticed, horbact, and mituark. Also, there's a passage to a trapseng. The allowed actions include some made-up verbs like alitst, lophante, rhypnon, ophabor, ompous, and hoadve. Plus the usual actions like open, take, etc.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the user mentioned that besides common actions, there are those specific verbs. So maybe I need to use those to interact with the items. The goal involves three things: rakeer, asceles, and mituark. But in the current room, I see asceles and mituark. Wait, the goal says "the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal and the mituark mationymb." Hmm, maybe "rakeer" is another item here? But in the current room, the items listed are inagness, asceles, otioct, ctaticed, horb
