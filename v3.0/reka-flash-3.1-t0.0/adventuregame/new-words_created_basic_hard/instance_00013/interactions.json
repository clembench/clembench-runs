First, I need to understand what these terms mean. Maybe they are objects or creatures in the game that need to be transformed or modified.\n\nLooking at the current room: there's a heccop. The items present are a inagness, asceles, otioct, ctaticed, horbact, and mituark. Also, there's a passage to a trapseng. The allowed actions include some made-up verbs like alitst, lophante, rhypnon, ophabor, ompous, and hoadve. Plus the usual actions like open, take, etc.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that besides common actions, there are those specific verbs. So maybe I need to use those to interact with the items. The goal involves three things: rakeer, asceles, and mituark. But in the current room, I see asceles and mituark. Wait, the goal says \"the rakeer skenic, the asceles tinhal and the mituark mationymb.\" Hmm, maybe \"rakeer\" is another item here?
