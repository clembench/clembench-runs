The goal is to make the \"pholoiced connone\", \"aeval proggiced\", and \"rheably exsem\". Those names don't make sense, so maybe they're made up words or abbreviations. Let's break them down.\n\nFirst, the current room has several items: versch, aeval, oidess, pholoiced, eical, and shromen. There's also a passage to an erove. The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, go, plus some weird ones: udial, aterous, ingnus, ivess, ceorid, unmastic.\n\nHmm. Maybe each of the goal phrases corresponds to combining or manipulating these items. Let's look at the goal phrases again:\n\n1. pholoiced connone\n2. aeval proggiced\n3. rheably exsem\n\nWait, \"pholoiced\" is one of the items here. So maybe \"pholoiced connone\" means combining pholoiced with connone. But where does connone come from? Maybe \"connone\" is a combination of other words? Or perhaps \"connone\" is a typo or mishearing. Alternatively, maybe each part of the goal is formed by two words from the items. Let's check the items again: versch, aeval, oidess, pholoiced, eical, sh",
