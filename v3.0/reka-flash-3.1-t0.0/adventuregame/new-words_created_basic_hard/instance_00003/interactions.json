Maybe they're objects or creatures in the game that need to be transformed or acted upon.\n\nLooking at the current room: there's a proark, a prolly, a hypner, shness, rabish, and arger. Also a passage to a comper. The user mentioned some special actions like seash, andect, lotis, belity, irear, and deint. I need to use these correctly.\n\nWait, the goal is to make three things specific. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Make the prolly lingly. Maybe \"lingly\" is a state or transformation. The prolly is one of the objects here. So perhaps I need to use an action on the prolly to turn it into something lingly.\n\n2. Make the proark incry. Similarly, \"incry\" might be a state. The proark is another object here. So apply an action to the proark to make it incry.\n\n3. Make the acion arliced. Wait, \"acion\" isn't listed in the current room. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps \"acion\" is another object. Let me check the initial description again. The room has proark, prolly, hypner",
