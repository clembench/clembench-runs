The prolly is one of the objects here. So perhaps I need to use an action on the prolly to turn it into something lingly.\n\n2. Make the proark incry. Similarly, \"incry\" might be a state. The proark is another object here. So apply an action to the proark to make it incry.\n\n3. Make the acion arliced. Wait, \"acion\" isn't listed in the current room. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps \"acion\" is another object. Let me check the initial description again. The room has proark, prolly, hypner",
