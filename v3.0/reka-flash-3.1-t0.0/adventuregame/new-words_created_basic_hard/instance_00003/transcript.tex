	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can seash, andect, lotis, belity, irear and deint.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the prolly lingly, the proark incry and the acion arliced.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a distral now. There are a proark, a prolly, a hypner, a shness, a rabish and a arger. There is a passage to a comper here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the prolly lingly, the proark incry, and the acion arliced. First, I need to figure out what each of these terms means. Maybe they're objects or creatures in the game that need to be transformed or acted upon.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room: there's a proark, a prolly, a hypner, shness, rabish, and arger. Also a passage to a comper. The user mentioned some special actions like seash, andect, lotis, belity, irear, and deint. I need to use these correctly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal is to make three things specific. Let's break it down:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Make the prolly lingly. Maybe "lingly" is a state or transformation. The prolly is one of the objects here. So perhaps I need to use an action on the prolly to turn it into something lingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt 2. Make the proark incry. Similarly, "incry" might be a state. The proark is another object here. So apply an action to the proark to make it incry.\\ \tt \\ \tt 3. Make the acion arliced. Wait, "acion" isn't listed in the current room. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps "acion" is another object. Let me check the initial description again. The room has proark, prolly, hypner
