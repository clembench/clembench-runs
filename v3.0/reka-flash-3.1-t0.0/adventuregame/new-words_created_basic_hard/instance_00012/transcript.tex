	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet and indiable.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust and the loscred tibing.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a discroust now. There are a eposper, a conitity, a urermat, a loscred, a suncente and a hidist. There is a passage to a gligiced here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the rimess horpler, the urermat ytoust, and the loscred tibing. I need to figure out what each of these items are and how to create them.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, looking at the current room: there's a eposper, conitity, urermat, loscred, suncente, and hidist. Also, a passage to a gligiced. The user mentioned some special actions like eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet, and indiable. Maybe those are verbs I can use with the objects.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal items are rimess horpler, urermat ytoust, and loscred tibing. The existing objects include urermat and loscred. So maybe "ytoust" and "tibing" are modifiers or actions related to those objects. Let me check the possible actions.\\ \tt \\ \tt The special actions are eredle, unsibion, phophous, isecin, horehet, indiable. Maybe I need to combine these with the objects. For example, using "unsibion" on the urermat to make it urermat ytoust? Or perhaps "horehet" on the loscred to make it loscred tibing?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the goal is to combine the existing items. The urermat is already present, so
