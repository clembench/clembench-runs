	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia and crury.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the eprour reging, the siaticed degra and the piesm ricke.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a lon now. There are a eprour, a teming, a riack, a siaticed, a orele and a astont. There is a passage to a lablent here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's try to figure out how to solve this text adventure game. The goal is to make the eprour reging, the siaticed degra, and the piesm ricke. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room description: I'm in a "lon now" (maybe a typo for "long room"?). There are several objects here: a eprour, a teming, a riack, a siaticed, an orele, and a astont. There's also a passage to a lablent (maybe "labyrinth"?). \\ \tt \\ \tt The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, go, etc., plus some others: erack, plecon, lowal, icalit, cretia, crury. I need to figure out what these custom actions do. Maybe they correspond to specific verbs related to the objects in the room.\\ \tt \\ \tt The goal involves three things: eprour reging, siaticed degra, piesm ricke. Let's break them down. \\ \tt \\ \tt First, "eprour reging" – maybe "eprour" needs to be "reging"? Or perhaps "reging" is a state or action. Similarly, "siaticed degra" – maybe "siaticed" needs to be "degra"? Or "degra" is a state.
