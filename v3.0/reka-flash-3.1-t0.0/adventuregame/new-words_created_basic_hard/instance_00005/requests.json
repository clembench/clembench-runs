Maybe they correspond to specific verbs related to the objects in the room.\n\nThe goal involves three things: eprour reging, siaticed degra, piesm ricke. Let's break them down. \n\nFirst, \"eprour reging\" – maybe \"eprour\" needs to be \"reging\"? Or perhaps \"reging\" is a state or action. Similarly, \"siaticed degra\" – maybe \"siaticed\" needs to be \"degra\"? Or \"degra\" is a state.",
