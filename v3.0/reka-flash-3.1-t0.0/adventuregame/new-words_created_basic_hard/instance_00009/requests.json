Alternatively, \"ecastic\" – maybe \"ecstatic\"? So \"oubiced ecastic\" could be \"decubito ecstatic\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubito\" backwards? Or maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubito\" misspelled. Alternatively, maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubited\" (past tense of decubitus, which is lying down). So \"decubited ecstatic\"? Not sure. Maybe the goal is to make something ecstatic that's decubited? Or maybe the anagram is \"decubited ecstatic\" but that's not making sense.
