Those names look a bit scrambled. Maybe they're anagrams? Let me check.\n\nFirst, \"oubiced ecastic\". Let's break it down. \"Oubiced\" – maybe \"decubito\" or something? Wait, \"oubiced\" could be rearranged. Let's see: O-U-B-I-C-E-D. Maybe \"decubito\" is a Latin term for lying down, but not sure. Alternatively, \"ecastic\" – maybe \"ecstatic\"? So \"oubiced ecastic\" could be \"decubito ecstatic\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubito\" backwards? Or maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubito\" misspelled. Alternatively, maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubited\" (past tense of decubitus, which is lying down). So \"decubited ecstatic\"? Not sure. Maybe the goal is to make something ecstatic that's decubited? Or maybe the anagram is \"decubited ecstatic\" but that's not making sense. Alternatively, maybe \"oubiced\" is \"decubito\" and \"ecastic\" is \"ecstatic\", so combining them as \"decubito ecstatic\" but I'm not",
