	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can prophedly, lystly, curatily, uncomagol, tationnis and sifoat.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the telyphy vatmene, the rogisart pineger and the pienthor exabarb.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a caligaticed now. There are a ubdonee, a tecural, a pienthor, a pakably, a rogisart and a aribess. There is a passage to a gurlite here.
