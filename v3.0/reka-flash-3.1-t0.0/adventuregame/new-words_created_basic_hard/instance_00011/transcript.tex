	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can amyoid, jolene, tritioush, oryter, atheris and urseum.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the utist hetioner, the icess tubilly and the anonaticed ippet.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a endroust now. There are a icess, a stoaced, a lableve, a coepticed, a utist and a atedist. There is a passage to a oidemat here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's try to figure out how to approach this game. The goal is to make the "utist hetioner", "icess tubilly", and "anonaticed ippet". Those names are a bit confusing with the mixed letters. Maybe they're typos or scrambled words? Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the items present in the current room. The description says there's a "icess", "stoaced", "lableve", "coepticed", "utist", and "atedist". Also, a passage to a "oidemat". The goal involves "utist", "icess", and "ippet". Wait, "ippet" isn't listed here. Maybe "anonaticed ippet" is a combination of parts from other items?\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me break down the goal items:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. utist hetioner: "utist" is one of the items here. "hetioner" â€“ maybe "hetion" is part of it? Not sure. Maybe "hetioner" is a scrambled word. Let's see: "hetioner" could be "hetion" + "er"? Or maybe "hetioner" is a made-up word. Alternatively, maybe "hetioner" is "het" + "ioner"? Not sure. Maybe "hetioner" is a combination of "het" (maybe "heat") and "ioner" (
