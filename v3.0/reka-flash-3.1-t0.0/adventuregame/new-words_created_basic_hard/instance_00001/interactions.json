Similarly, \"nolog\" for rably and \"atorily\" for imped? Wait, the third goal is \"the imped atory.\" Maybe \"imped atory\" is a typo or a specific term. Maybe \"imped atory\" is supposed to be \"impeditory\" or something else. But the user wrote \"imped atory\" with a space. Maybe it's two words: \"imped\" and \"atory\"? Not sure.
