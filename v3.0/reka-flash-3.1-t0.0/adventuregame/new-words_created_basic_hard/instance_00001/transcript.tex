	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can delly, heted, ousne, unalin, thoty and ceous.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the secti unpish, the rably nolog and the imped atory.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a perced now. There are a inet, a secti, a rably, a torish, a stism and a nond. There is a passage to a uner here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the secti unpish, the rably nolog, and the imped atory. First, I need to figure out what each of these terms means. Maybe they're objects or creatures in the game that need to be transformed or modified.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room has a perced (maybe a type of room?), an inet, a secti, a rably, a torish, a stism, and a nond. There's also a passage to a uner. The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, go, plus some others like delly, heted, ousne, unalin, thoty, ceous. I need to use these to achieve the goals.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, let's look at the secti. The goal is to make it unpish. Maybe "unpish" is a state or a transformation. Similarly, "nolog" for rably and "atorily" for imped? Wait, the third goal is "the imped atory." Maybe "imped atory" is a typo or a specific term. Maybe "imped atory" is supposed to be "impeditory" or something else. But the user wrote "imped atory" with a space. Maybe it's two words: "imped" and "atory"? Not sure. Maybe "imped atory" is a state or a target.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the
