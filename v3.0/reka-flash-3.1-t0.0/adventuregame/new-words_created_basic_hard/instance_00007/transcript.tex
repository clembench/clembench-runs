	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the hetle anird, the ioness opige, and the rotont reforian. I need to figure out what each of these means. Maybe "hetle" is a typo or a specific term in the game. The current room has a herper, rotont, equadish, thium, ioness, and fervan. There's also a passage to a routiced.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to identify which of these creatures or objects correspond to hetle, ioness, and rotont. The rotont is already present, so maybe I need to change its state to reforian. The ioness is there too, so changing it to opige. The hetle might be one of the other creatures like herper, equadish, thium, or fervan. Wait, the user mentioned "hetle" but in the current room, the creatures listed are herper, rotont, equadish, thium, ioness, fervan. So hetle isn't here. Maybe hetle is in another room? The passage leads to routiced. So perhaps I need to go there first.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description says "You are in a atival now." Maybe "atival" is a typo for "atrium"? Not sure. The passage is to a routiced. So maybe I should go to routiced first. Let me check the
