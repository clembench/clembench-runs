	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic and proar.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the inat mateny, the diale unsust and the subst dented.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a cally now. There are a sness, a mical, a pante, a inat, a subst and a eness. There is a passage to a unree here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the "inat mateny", "diale unsust", and "subst dented". I need to figure out what these mean. Maybe they are objects in the room that need to be modified.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room: there's a sness, mical, pante, inat, subst, and eness. Also a passage to unree. The allowed actions include mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic, proar. Hmm, not sure what those do. Maybe they are verbs that act on the nouns.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the goal mentions "inat mateny". Wait, maybe "inat" is an object here. The current objects are inat, subst, etc. So maybe "inat" needs to be "mateny"? But how? Maybe the action mator? Like "mator inat"? Or maybe "mateny" is a state. Wait, the goal is to make "inat mateny", so perhaps the inat object needs to be transformed into mateny. But how?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe "inat mateny" is a phrase that needs to be achieved by interacting with the inat object. Maybe "mateny" is a state. So perhaps I need to perform an action on inat to make it mateny. Let's check the allowed actions. The actions are mator, unbal, gatic
