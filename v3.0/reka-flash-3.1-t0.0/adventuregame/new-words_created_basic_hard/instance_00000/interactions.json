Maybe they are objects in the room that need to be modified.\n\nLooking at the current room: there's a sness, mical, pante, inat, subst, and eness. Also a passage to unree. The allowed actions include mator, unbal, gatic, remic, ratic, proar. Hmm, not sure what those do. Maybe they are verbs that act on the nouns.\n\nFirst, the goal mentions \"inat mateny\". Wait, maybe \"inat\" is an object here. The current objects are inat, subst, etc. So maybe \"inat\" needs to be \"mateny\"? But how? Maybe the action mator? Like \"mator inat\"? Or maybe \"mateny\" is a state. Wait, the goal is to make \"inat mateny\", so perhaps the inat object needs to be transformed into mateny. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"inat mateny\" is a phrase that needs to be achieved by interacting with the inat object. Maybe \"mateny\" is a state. So perhaps I need to perform an action on inat to make it mateny. Let's check the allowed actions. The actions are mator, unbal, gatic",
