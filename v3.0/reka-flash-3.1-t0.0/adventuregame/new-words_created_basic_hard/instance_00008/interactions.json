The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, go, etc., plus some others: abluty, uningne, athemb, altric, polotit, and arimic.\n\nWait, the goal mentions \"hooiced nionian\" and \"nusion nophyle\". But in the current room, there's a \"hooiced\" and a \"nophyle\"? Wait, the items listed are hooiced, alloger, eleniced, gicalio, glogly, chophal. Wait, maybe \"nophyle\" is a typo? Or perhaps \"nusion\" is a typo for \"nousion\"? The goal says \"nousion nophyle\". Maybe the items in the room are \"hooiced\", \"nophyle\", but in the current description, I don't see \"n",
