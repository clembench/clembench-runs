	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's try to figure out how to solve this game. The goal is to make the chophal permity, the hooiced nionian, and the nousion nophyle. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room description: I'm in a hydroft. There are a hooiced, a alloger, a eleniced, a gicalio, a glogly, and a chophal. There's a passage to a itink. The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, go, etc., plus some others: abluty, uningne, athemb, altric, polotit, and arimic.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions "hooiced nionian" and "nusion nophyle". But in the current room, there's a "hooiced" and a "nophyle"? Wait, the items listed are hooiced, alloger, eleniced, gicalio, glogly, chophal. Wait, maybe "nophyle" is a typo? Or perhaps "nusion" is a typo for "nousion"? The goal says "nousion nophyle". Maybe the items in the room are "hooiced", "nophyle", but in the current description, I don't see "n
