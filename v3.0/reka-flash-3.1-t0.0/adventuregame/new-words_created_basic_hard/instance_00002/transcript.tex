	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can latory, tedne, derman, tuate, chross and sulphy.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the tulacy enerk, the menny soriced and the ortid alism.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a catint now. There are a unflued, a pacia, a sioust, a rist, a ortid and a menny. There is a passage to a penol here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to make the tulacy enerk, the menny soriced, and the ortid alism. First, I need to figure out what each of those terms means in the game context. Maybe they're objects or items that need to be transformed or combined in some way.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at the current room: catint. The items present are unflued, pacia, sioust, rist, ortid, and menny. There's also a passage to a penol. The allowed actions include common ones like open, take, use, etc., plus some others like latory, tedne, derman, tuate, chross, sulphy. Not sure what those do yet. Maybe they're specific verbs for certain interactions.\\ \tt \\ \tt First step: identify which items are relevant to the goals. The ortid is one of the items here. The goal mentions "ortid alism." Maybe "alism" is a state or action related to the ortid. Similarly, "menny soriced" and "tulacy enerk." Wait, the user mentioned "tulacy" but in the current room, the items are unflued, pacia, sioust, rist, ortid, menny. So maybe "tulacy" is a typo or a different item? Or perhaps "tulacy" is part of another object's name? Not sure. Maybe I need
