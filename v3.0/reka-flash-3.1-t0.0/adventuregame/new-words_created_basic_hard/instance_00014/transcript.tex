	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can anumman, phinding, llatic, eoster, ntion and cumative.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Make the bintioust atilioned, the forotoly serhing and the retritt aurpher.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a realighy now. There are a avirriced, a shemood, a urafflag, a iscolad, a forotoly and a retritt. There is a passage to a rofflum here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's try to figure out how to approach this game. The goal is to make the "bintioust atilioned", "forotoly serhing", and "retritt aurpher". Those names look a bit jumbled, maybe they're misspelled or scrambled? Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to look at the items present in the current room. The user mentioned: a avirriced, a shemood, a urafflag, a iscolad, a forotoly, and a retritt. Also, there's a passage to a rofflum. Wait, those item names are probably misspelled too. Let me try to correct them based on common words. \\ \tt \\ \tt "Avirriced" might be "avocado"? "Shemood" could be "shampoo"? "Uraflag" maybe "urinal flag"? "Iscadad" perhaps "escalator"? "Forotoly" sounds like "forerole" or "foreroller"? "Retritt" could be "retrite" or "retritt" as given. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're anagrams. Let's check:\\ \tt \\ \tt - avirriced: letters a, v, i, r, r, i, c, e, d. Maybe "avocado" (a, v, o, c, a, d, o)
