Those names look a bit jumbled, maybe they're misspelled or scrambled? Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the items present in the current room. The user mentioned: a avirriced, a shemood, a urafflag, a iscolad, a forotoly, and a retritt. Also, there's a passage to a rofflum. Wait, those item names are probably misspelled too. Let me try to correct them based on common words. \n\n\"Avirriced\" might be \"avocado\"? \"Shemood\" could be \"shampoo\"? \"Uraflag\" maybe \"urinal flag\"? \"Iscadad\" perhaps \"escalator\"? \"Forotoly\" sounds like \"forerole\" or \"foreroller\"? \"Retritt\" could be \"retrite\" or \"retritt\" as given. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe they're anagrams. Let's check:\n\n- avirriced: letters a, v, i, r, r, i, c, e, d. Maybe \"avocado\" (a, v, o, c, a, d, o)",
