	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can ropile, ecast and sinark.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the aterve in the altriced, the abluty on the conader and the mop on the conader.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a bed, a altriced and a aterve. The pillow is on the bed. The altriced is closed. The aterve is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the aterve in the altriced, the abluty on the conader, and the mop on the conader. First, I need to figure out where these items are and what they are.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room is a bedroom. The items mentioned here are a pillow, a bed, an altriced (which I think is a chest or something similar), and an aterve. The aterve is on the floor. There's a passage to a hallway. Wait, but the other items needed for the goal are abluty and mop, which aren't mentioned here. Maybe they are in the hallway or another room? The user hasn't described those yet. So perhaps I need to go to the hallway first to find those items.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the initial description only lists the items in the bedroom. The other items (abluty, mop, conader) might be in other areas. The user hasn't provided info about the hallway yet. So maybe I need to move to the hallway to explore further. Let me check the current room again. The altriced is closed. The aterve is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The goal is to put aterve in altriced. So first step: open the altriced to see if it's empty or has something. But the altriced is closed. So maybe I need to open it first
