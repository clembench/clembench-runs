The wardrobe is closed. The other items mentioned in the goal are mator, remiced, and proart. Wait, maybe \"mator\" is a typo? Could it be \"mat\" or \"mattress\"? \"Remiced\" might be \"refrigerator\" or \"remiced\" as a made-up word. \"Proart\" could be \"portrait\" or \"pro art\" something. Hmm, maybe I need to look for clues in the environment.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that in addition to common actions, there are natin, perce, and trion. Not sure what those do yet. Maybe they are special commands. Let me check the initial description again. The current room has a wardrobe, book, aphon, bed, and a passage to the hallway. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor, aphon on the bed. The goal items are aphon in mator, book on remiced, proart on table. So I need to find where mator, remiced, and proart are",
