There's a passage to a olict (maybe another room?).\n\nWait, the user mentioned that in addition to common actions, I can use lispe, degra, and lones. Not sure what those do yet. Maybe they're special commands. Let me check the initial description again. The example action was \"open cupboard\", so maybe \"ovesish\" is a cupboard? The ovesish is closed. So maybe I need to open it first. Let's try that.\n\nSo first action: open ovesish. Let's see what's inside. If there's the setral there, then I can take it. Then I need to find the iscad to put the setral in. But where is the iscad? The current room has a pillow, bed, ovesish, book. Maybe the iscad is in another room. The passage leads to a olict. So maybe I need to go there.\n\nWait, the goal is to put setral in iscad, lablent on mingnee, eriat on mingnee. So three items to place. Let's",
