The user mentioned that the eleniced is part of the goal, but in the current description, the items present are gicalio, book, nophyle, and chophal. Maybe the eleniced is somewhere else or maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps the eleniced is an item I need to find? The initial description says \"You are in a bedroom now. There are a gicalio, a book, a nophyle and a chophal.\" So the eleniced isn't here. Maybe the eleniced is in another room? The passage to hydroft is here. So maybe I need to go to hydroft to get the eleniced? But the goal is to put the eleniced on the matiorm. But the matiorm isn't mentioned here. Maybe the matiorm is in another room? Or perhaps the matiorm is an object that's part of the current room but not listed? The initial description lists the items present: gicalio, book, nophyle, chophal. The chophal is closed. The book is on the floor, nophyle is on the gicalio, chophal is closed. So the matiorm isn't",
