First, I need to figure out what these objects are. Maybe \"dermin\" is a typo? Could it be \"dirt\" or \"dormin\" (like a room)? \"Deint\" might be \"dent\" or \"decent\"? \"Riat\" and \"mop\" are more straightforward, but \"riat\" isn't a common word. Maybe it's a typo for \"riat\" as in a specific object in the game? The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, I can use stfule, lotis, and andect. Those don't ring a bell.
