The venism is on the bed, the book is on the floor. The wardrobe is closed. The user mentioned \"cunad\" and \"ciot\" as targets. Maybe those are objects in the room? Let me check the initial description again.\n\nWait, the initial description says: \"You are in a bedroom now. There are a bed, a venism, a wardrobe and a book. The venism is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a toxist here.\" So the items present are bed, venism, wardrobe, book. The passage is to a toxist, but I don't know what that is. Maybe another room? The goal mentions cunad and ciot, which aren't listed here. Maybe those are objects in the wardrobe or another room? Or perhaps typos? Wait, maybe \"cunad\" is \"cupboard\" and \"ciot\" is \"cot\"? Or maybe \"cunad\" is a typo for \"cabinet\" and \"ciot\" is",
