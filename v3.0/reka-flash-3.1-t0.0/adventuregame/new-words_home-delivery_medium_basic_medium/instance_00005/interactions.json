Maybe they're typos or scrambled? Let's break them down.\n\n\"arliced\" – maybe \"apple sliced\"? That makes sense in a game context. \"atent\" – could be \"tent\"? \"comper\" – maybe \"computer\"? \"comess\" – perhaps \"compass\"? \"distral\" – maybe \"distract\" or \"distral\" as a place? Wait, the user mentioned \"comess on the distral.\" Maybe \"distral\" is a typo for \"distraction\" or a specific object. Alternatively, maybe \"distral\" is a room or a place in the game. Let me check the current room description.\n\nThe player is in a cross (maybe a crossroads or a cross-shaped room). There's a wardrobe, a book, an incry (maybe \"incri\" – incense?), and a pillow. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the incry. There's a passage to a hallway here.\n\nWait, the initial description says \"incry\" – maybe that's a typo for \"incri\" (incense?) or \"incry\" as a noun. The pillow is on the incry. So maybe",
