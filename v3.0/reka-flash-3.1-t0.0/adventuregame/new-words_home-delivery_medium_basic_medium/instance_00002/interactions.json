There's a pillow on the bed, a bed, a wardrobe that's closed, a book on the floor, and a passage to a nolog. Wait, the user mentioned \"aling, vater, and nogia\" as possible actions, but I'm not sure how those fit in. Maybe those are typos or specific commands for the game? Maybe \"aling\" is \"align\", \"vater\" could be \"water\", and \"nogia\" might be a place or object? Not sure yet. Let's focus on the items first.\n\nThe target items are secti, inet, and broom. But in the current room, the items listed are pillow, bed, wardrobe, book, and passage. Wait, maybe \"secti\", \"inet\", and \"broom\" are part of the game's items that I haven't encountered yet.
