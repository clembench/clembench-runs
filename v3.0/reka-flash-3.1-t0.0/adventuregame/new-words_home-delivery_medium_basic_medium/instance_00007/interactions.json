A passage to the hallway. So the plate isn't here yet. Wait, the goal mentions putting the plate on the aciong. Maybe the aciong is a piece of furniture here?

Hmm, maybe I need to explore the hallway to find the inchan and aciong?\n\nWait, the initial description says \"You are in a encal now.\" So maybe \"encal\" is a room. The passage leads to a hallway. So first, maybe I should go to the hallway to see what's there. Let's check the current items again. The book is on the floor, oroust on the bed. The wardrobe is closed.
