First, I need to figure out what these items are based on the description given.\n\nThe current room has a pillow, a wardrobe, a book, and a scont. The pillow is on the scont. There's a passage to a unree. Wait, \"unree\" might be a typo or a specific term in the game. Maybe \"unree\" is a room or a place? Not sure yet. Let's list the items mentioned in the goal: subst, unsust, mical, table, maten, dente. None of these are in the current room. So maybe I need to explore other areas.\n\nThe passage to a unree is here. So maybe moving to the unree room will introduce new items. Let's check the current items again. The scont is mentioned; maybe that's a surface. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the scont. The wardrobe could be opened to find items. The book might have something inside or be a clue. The scont could be a shelf or a cot. The passage to unree is an exit.\n\nFirst step: open the wardrobe to see if there are items inside. The wardrobe is closed, so opening it might reveal subst or other items. Let",
