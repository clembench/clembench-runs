	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can inate, pante and eness.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the subst in the unsust, the mical on the table and the maten on the dente.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a pillow, a wardrobe, a book and a scont. The pillow is on the scont. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. There is a passage to a unree here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the subst in the unsust, place the mical on the table, and put the maten on the dente. First, I need to figure out what these items are based on the description given.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room has a pillow, a wardrobe, a book, and a scont. The pillow is on the scont. There's a passage to a unree. Wait, "unree" might be a typo or a specific term in the game. Maybe "unree" is a room or a place? Not sure yet. Let's list the items mentioned in the goal: subst, unsust, mical, table, maten, dente. None of these are in the current room. So maybe I need to explore other areas.\\ \tt \\ \tt The passage to a unree is here. So maybe moving to the unree room will introduce new items. Let's check the current items again. The scont is mentioned; maybe that's a surface. The wardrobe is closed. The book is on the floor. The pillow is on the scont. The wardrobe could be opened to find items. The book might have something inside or be a clue. The scont could be a shelf or a cot. The passage to unree is an exit.\\ \tt \\ \tt First step: open the wardrobe to see if there are items inside. The wardrobe is closed, so opening it might reveal subst or other items. Let
