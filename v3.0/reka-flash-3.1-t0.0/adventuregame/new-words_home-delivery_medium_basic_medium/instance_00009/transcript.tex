	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can babile, ricary and scidia.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the riack in the teming, the plate on the taillag and the mop on the taillag.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a bedroom now. There are a teming, a pillow, a bed and a riack. The teming is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The riack is on the floor. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the riack in the teming, the plate on the taillag, and the mop on the taillag. First, I need to figure out where these items are located.\\ \tt \\ \tt The current room is a bedroom. The items mentioned here are the teming (which I think is a typo for "teeming"? Or maybe "teming" is a specific object in the game?), a pillow, a bed, a riack (maybe "rack"?), and a passage to a hallway. The teming is closed. The pillow is on the bed. The riack is on the floor. So the riack is on the floor in the bedroom. The teming is closed here too. Wait, the teming is closed. So maybe the teming is a container or something that needs to be opened first?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal is to put the riack in the teming. So first, I need to get the riack and place it inside the teming. But the teming is closed. So maybe I need to open the teming first. But how? The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, there are babile, ricary, and scidia. Not sure what those do. Maybe they are special actions? The example given was "open cupboard", which is a common action. So perhaps the special actions are verbs like babile, ricary, scidia. But
