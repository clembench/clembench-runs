The riack is on the floor. So the riack is on the floor in the bedroom. The teming is closed here too. Wait, the teming is closed. So maybe the teming is a container or something that needs to be opened first?\n\nWait, the goal is to put the riack in the teming. So first, I need to get the riack and place it inside the teming. But the teming is closed. So maybe I need to open the teming first. But how? The user mentioned that in addition to common actions, there are babile, ricary, and scidia. Not sure what those do. Maybe they are special actions? The example given was \"open cupboard\", which is a common action. So perhaps the special actions are verbs like babile, ricary, scidia. But",
