	 You are playing a text adventure game. I will describe what you can perceive in the game. You write the single action you want to take in the game starting with >. Only reply with an action.\\ \tt For example:\\ \tt > open cupboard\\ \tt \\ \tt In addition to common actions, you can omante, precine and astable.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your goal for this game is: Put the atoust in the erack, the plecon on the stingly and the mop on the stingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Once you have achieved your goal, write "> done" to end the game.\\ \tt \\ \tt You are in a crury now. There are a atoust, a pillow, a bed and a wardrobe. The atoust is on the floor. The pillow is on the bed. The wardrobe is closed. There is a passage to a hallway here.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's see. The goal is to put the atoust in the erack, the plecon on the stingly, and the mop on the stingly. The user mentioned "erack" and "stingly" which might be typos. Looking back at the initial description, the items are a atoust, a pillow, a bed, and a wardrobe. The wardrobe is closed. There's a passage to a hallway.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the goal mentions "erack" and "stingly". Maybe "erack" is a typo for "wardrobe" since that's an item here. And "stingly" could be "stingy" or maybe "stingy" is a typo for "stingy" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe "stingly" is a place or another object. Wait, the initial items are atoust, pillow, bed, wardrobe. The user's goal is to put atoust in erack (wardrobe?), plecon on stingly, and mop on stingly. But the current items don't include plecon or mop. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me check again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Original problem statement: "Put the atoust in the erack, the plecon on the stingly and the mop on the stingly." The items present are atoust, pillow, bed, wardrobe. So perhaps "plecon" and "mop" are typos
