	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Recreation room. Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Recreation room, and the only available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Recreation room as a node. The edges are empty except for the direction given. Wait, in the example, when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge west of Living Room connects to Library. So the edges are directional. So each edge is a directed connection. But in the graph representation, the edges are listed per direction. For example, in the example, the west edge of Living Room has [("Living Room", "Library")], which I think represents that from Living Room, going west leads to Library. So the edges are stored as a list of tuples for each direction, indicating the source and destination.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the graph needs to track which rooms are connected in which directions. Each time we move, we add the new room to the nodes list and update the edges accordingly. For example, moving east from Recreation to another room (let's say East Room) would add East Room to nodes and add an edge east from Recreation to East Room, and maybe a west edge from East Room to
