Currently available directions: east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Recreation room, and the only available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Recreation room as a node. The edges are empty except for the direction given. Wait, in the example, when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge west of Living Room connects to Library. So the edges are directional. So each edge is a directed connection. But in the graph representation, the edges are listed per direction. For example, in the example, the west edge of Living Room has [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], which I think represents that from Living Room, going west leads to Library. So the edges are stored as a list of tuples for each direction, indicating the source and destination.\n\nSo the graph needs to track which rooms are connected in which directions. Each time we move, we add the new room to the nodes list and update the edges accordingly. For example, moving east from Recreation to another room (let's say East Room) would add East Room to nodes and add an edge east from Recreation to East Room, and maybe a west edge from East Room to",
