What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Media room with only north available. Let's say I go north first. But wait, since I need to minimize room changes, maybe I should explore as much as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since it's the first step, there's no backtracking yet. So, the initial move is to go north. But I need to build the graph as I go.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library (west), the edge is added to the graph. So each edge is bidirectional? Because when you go west from Living Room to Library, the edge is listed as west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. But when moving north from Library to Kitchen, the edge is north: [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. So the graph seems to track",
