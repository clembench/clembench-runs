In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Media room with only north available. Let's say I go north first. But wait, since I need to minimize room changes, maybe I should explore as much as possible in one direction before backtracking. But since it's the first step, there's no backtracking yet. So, the initial move is to go north. But I need to build the graph as I go.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library (west), the edge is added to the graph. So each edge is bidirectional? Because when you go west from Living Room to Library, the edge is listed as west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. But when moving north from Library to Kitchen, the edge is north: [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. So the graph seems to track",
