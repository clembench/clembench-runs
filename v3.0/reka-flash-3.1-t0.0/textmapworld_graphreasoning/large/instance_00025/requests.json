Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and the directions between them are edges. The user will provide the current room and available directions each time. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the path to ensure minimal steps.\n\nStarting in the Pantry with directions north and south. Let's assume the graph starts with just the Pantry. The available directions are north and south, but since we haven't visited any other rooms yet, both are unexplored. To minimize steps, I should probably pick one direction and explore as far as possible before backtracking. But since BFS is optimal for shortest path, maybe I should explore all possible paths level by level.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the next move each time. So each step is a decision. The challenge is to build the graph incrementally and choose directions that lead to unvisited rooms, ensuring that we cover all rooms with the least number of moves.\n\nLet me think step by step. The initial state is Pantry. Directions north and south",
