Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].

What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Attic, and the available direction is west. The initial graph has just the Attic as a node. The edges are empty except for west, which might connect to another room. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is minimal.\n\nThe example provided shows that each move adds the new room to the nodes list and updates the edges. The edges are bidirectional, so if I go west from Attic to a new room, say a Hallway, the edge west from Attic would point to Hallway, and east from Hallway would point back to Attic. But in the example, when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge west of Living Room is [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], but the east edge of Library isn't shown. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the first step, the user is in Living Room, goes west to Library. The graph's edges for west of Living Room is [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], but the east edge of Library isn't listed. Maybe the edges are represented as a list of tuples",
