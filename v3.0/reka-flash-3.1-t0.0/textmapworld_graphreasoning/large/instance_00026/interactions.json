In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Nursery, and the only available direction is south. The initial graph has just the Nursery node. The edges are empty except for whatever connections are made as we move.\n\nThe example provided shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. The edges are bidirectional, so if I go from Nursery to south to another room, say Hallway, the edge between them should be added in both directions. Wait, looking at the example: when moving from Living Room to west to Library, the edge is added as west from Living Room to Library, and presumably north from Library to Living Room? Wait, in the example, after moving west to Library, the edges for west in the graph have [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Wait, the edges are structured as a dictionary where each direction has a list of tuples. So for each direction, the list contains pairs of connected rooms. For example, in the second step, the edges for west have [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], which probably means that from Living Room west leads to Library, and from Library east",
