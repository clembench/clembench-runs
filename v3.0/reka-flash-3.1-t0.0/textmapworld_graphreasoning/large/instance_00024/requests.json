Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].

What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Bar, and the available direction is west. The initial graph has just the Bar as a node. The edges are empty except for west, which is connected to whatever room is west of the Bar. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is minimal.\n\nThe example provided shows that each move adds the new room to the nodes list and updates the edges. The edges are bidirectional, so if you go from A to B west, then B's east should point back to A. Wait, looking at the example: when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge west of Living Room is connected to Library, and the edge east of Library is connected to Living Room. So the edges are stored as a list of tuples indicating the connected room. So each direction in the edges has a list of connected rooms. For example, in the second step, the edges for west in Living Room are [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], but wait, no. Wait, in the example, after moving west from Living Room to Library, the graph's edges for west in Living",
