In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Gallery, and the only available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Gallery node. The edges are empty except for east, which is connected to whatever room is east. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is just the starting node.\n\nThe first move should be east to explore that direction. Once we move east, we'll enter a new room. Let's say that's Room A. Now, the graph needs to be updated to include Room A and the edge between Gallery and Room A. The available directions in Room A might be east again, or other directions. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, we need to explore as much as possible in each step without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" So each move is a room change. So the total number of moves (actions) should be minimized. That aligns with BFS, which explores all rooms at the current depth before moving to the next level. So BFS would ensure that once all rooms at a certain distance are visited, we",
