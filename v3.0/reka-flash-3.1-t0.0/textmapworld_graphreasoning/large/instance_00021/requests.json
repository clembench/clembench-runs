What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Gallery, and the only available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Gallery node. The edges are empty except for east, which is connected to whatever room is east. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is just the starting node.\n\nThe first move should be east to explore that direction. Once we move east, we'll enter a new room. Let's say that's Room A. Now, the graph needs to be updated to include Room A and the edge between Gallery and Room A. The available directions in Room A might be east again, or other directions. But since the goal is to minimize room changes, we need to explore as much as possible in each step without backtracking too much.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"fewest number of room changes possible.\" So each move is a room change. So the total number of moves (actions) should be minimized. That aligns with BFS, which explores all rooms at the current depth before moving to the next level. So BFS would ensure that once all rooms at a certain distance are visited, we",
