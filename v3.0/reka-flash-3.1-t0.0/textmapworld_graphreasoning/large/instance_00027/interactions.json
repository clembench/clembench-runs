In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least number of moves. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably similar to BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which would minimize the number of steps needed to reach all nodes.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each time. My job is to choose the next direction to go, updating the graph as I go, and eventually stop when all rooms are visited.\n\nStarting in the Living room with directions west and east. Let's say the initial graph has just the Living room node. The edges for each direction start empty. When I move west, for example, I add the new room (let's say it's the Kitchen) to the nodes list and create an edge between Living and Kitchen in the west direction. Similarly for east.\n\nWait, but the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library via west, the edge is added as west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So the edges are directional? Or are they bidirectional? The example's graph shows that when moving west from Living to Library, the",
