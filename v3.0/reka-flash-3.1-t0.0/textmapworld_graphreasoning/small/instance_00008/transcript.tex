	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least number of moves. But how do I approach this?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Closet, which has available directions west and east. The example given shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. The graph needs to represent the map as it's uncovered. So, each time I move, I should update the nodes and edges accordingly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge west in the graph is updated to connect Living Room and Library. But in the edges, each direction has a list of tuples. For instance, west: [("Living Room", "Library")]. So, each edge direction lists the connections from the current node. But maybe the graph is built as we explore, adding nodes and edges as we go.\\ \tt \\ \tt The challenge is to explore all rooms with the fewest steps. This sounds like a shortest path problem, but since the map is unknown and we have to explore it incrementally, it's more like a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is typically used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. So maybe we should use BFS to explore the rooms, keeping track of visited rooms to avoid cycles.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I model the graph as I go? Each time
