In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. The user starts in the Bedroom with only east available. The example shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between them. The challenge is to explore all nodes (rooms) with the least number of moves. This sounds like a Breadth-First Search (BFS) problem because BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which ensures the shortest path.\n\nBut since the user is making moves step by step, I need to keep track of visited rooms and the path taken. Wait, but the user is providing the current room and available directions each time. So the assistant has to decide the next move based on the current state, building the graph incrementally.\n\nWait, the assistant's response includes the graph they've built so far. So each time the user enters a new room, the assistant updates the graph with the new node and edges. The edges should represent connections between rooms. For example, if moving west from the Living Room leads to the Library, then the edge west of Living Room should point to Library, and east of Library points back to Living Room.\n\nBut how to track",
