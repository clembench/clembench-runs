In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: east\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\": [\"Living Room\", \"Library\", \"Kitchen\"], \"edges\":{\"north\": [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")],\"south\": [],\"east\": [],\"west\": [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\n...\nYou have made a step and entered a Bedroom.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Studio, and the only available direction is west. So the first move should be west. But wait, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with edges. Let me check the example again. In the first step, the user is in the Living Room, goes west to the Library. The graph's edges for west have (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So edges are bidirectional? Because when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added in west direction for Living Room and maybe east for Library? Wait, looking at the example's second step: after moving north to Kitchen, the edges for north have [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. So each edge is represented once, but in the direction from the current room. Hmm, maybe the edges are stored as a list of tuples for each direction, but each connection is only listed once. Wait, in the first example, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge of Living Room has [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], but the east edge of Library would be [(\"Library\", \"Living Room",
