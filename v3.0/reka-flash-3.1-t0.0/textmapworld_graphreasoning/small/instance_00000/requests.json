What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Studio, and the only available direction is west. So the first move should be west. But wait, the example shows that when moving, the graph is updated with edges. Let me check the example again. In the first step, the user is in the Living Room, goes west to the Library. The graph's edges for west have (\"Living Room\", \"Library\"). So edges are bidirectional? Because when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added in west direction for Living Room and maybe east for Library? Wait, looking at the example's second step: after moving north to Kitchen, the edges for north have [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. So each edge is represented once, but in the direction from the current room. Hmm, maybe the edges are stored as a list of tuples for each direction, but each connection is only listed once. Wait, in the first example, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the west edge of Living Room has [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")], but the east edge of Library would be [(\"Library\", \"Living Room",
