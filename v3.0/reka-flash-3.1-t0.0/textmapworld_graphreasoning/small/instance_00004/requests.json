What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Guest room, and the only available direction is west. The initial graph has just the Guest room as a node. The edges are empty except for west, which is connected to whatever room is west of Guest. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is just the Guest room with no edges.\n\nThe first move should be to go west into the next room. Let's call that room, say, Room A. Now, the graph has two nodes: Guest and Room A. The edge west from Guest connects to Room A. But we need to track the connections in both directions. So, if Guest's west leads to Room A, then Room A's east should lead back to Guest. Wait, but the problem says that when you move, you need to update the graph. So each time you move, you add the new room to the graph and update the edges for both the current room and the new room.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge west of Living Room is connected to Library, and the edge east of Library",
