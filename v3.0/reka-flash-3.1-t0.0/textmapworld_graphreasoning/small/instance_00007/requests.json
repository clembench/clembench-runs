Currently available directions: west. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Home theater, and the only available direction is west. The initial graph has just the Home theater node. The edges are empty except for west, which is connected to whatever room is west. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is just the starting node.\n\nThe first move should be to go west into the next room. Let's call that room, say, Room A. Now, the graph has two nodes: Home theater and Room A. The edge west from Home theater connects to Room A. But we need to track all connections. Each time we move, we add the new room to the graph and update the edges.\n\nWait, but how do we represent the graph? The example shows edges as a dictionary where each direction has a list of tuples. For example, west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. So each edge is a pair of nodes connected in that direction. So when moving west from Home theater to Room A, the west edge of Home theater would have (Home theater, Room A), and the east edge of Room A would have (Room A",
