In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: north\", \"graph\":{\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\", \"Library\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Kitchen.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Media room, and the only available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Media room as a node. The edges are empty except for the direction given. Wait, in the example, when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge west from Living Room connects to Library. So the edges are bidirectional? Because when you go west from Living Room to Library, the edge west in Living Room's entry points to Library, and the east edge in Library's entry would point back to Living Room? Or maybe the edges are represented as connections between nodes, so each edge is a pair. Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, after moving west from Living Room to Library, the graph's edges for west in Living Room is empty? Wait, no. Wait the first step: the user is in Living Room, available directions south and west. The action is GO: west. The graph's edges for west in Living Room is empty? Wait the example's second message shows the graph as edges: west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Wait no, looking",
