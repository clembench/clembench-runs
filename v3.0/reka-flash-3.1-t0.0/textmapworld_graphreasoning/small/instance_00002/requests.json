What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Pantry, and the available direction is north. The initial graph has just the Pantry node. The edges are empty except for north, which might connect to another room. But since we haven't moved yet, the graph is just the Pantry with no edges.\n\nThe first step is to move north from the Pantry. Let's say that takes us to a new room, maybe the Kitchen. Now, the graph needs to reflect that connection. The edges for north from Pantry would point to Kitchen, and Kitchen's south would point back to Pantry. But wait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library west, the edge is added as west from Living Room to Library. So the edges are directional. So each direction in a room's edges lists the connected rooms. For example, if you go west from Living Room to Library, then in the edges, west of Living Room has Library, and east of Library would have Living Room? Or maybe each edge is stored as a pair. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the second step",
