In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Kitchen with directions north and south. Let's assume the graph starts with just the Kitchen. The edges for Kitchen would have north and south as possible directions, but since we haven't visited those rooms yet, they might be empty in the graph.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge west is added from Living Room to Library. So the edges are bidirectional? Because in the example, the edge west from Living Room connects to Library, and presumably the reverse (east from Library to Living Room) is also there. But in the example's graph, the edges are represented as a dictionary where each direction lists the connected nodes. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the first step, the graph has nodes [\"Living Room\"], edges with west empty. Then after",
