The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least number of moves. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Billiard room with directions south, west, and east available. The example given shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. The graph needs to represent the map as it's uncovered. So, each time I move, I should update the graph to include the new room and the connections between the current room and the next.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library (west), the edge west in the graph for Living Room is updated to include the connection to Library. But in the edges, it's a list of tuples? Like (\"Living Room\", \"Library\")? Or is it just a list of room names? Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the second step, the graph's edges for west is [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Wait, no. Wait, the first example's graph after moving west from Living Room to Library has edges: west: [] for Living Room? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the first user input is in the Living Room, available directions south and west. The assistant's response is to go west. The graph in the response is nodes: [\"Living Room\"],",
