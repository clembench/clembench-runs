In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead.

Currently available directions: south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Laundry room, and the only available direction is south. The initial graph has just the Laundry room as a node. The edges are empty except for the south direction, but since there's only one room, maybe the edges are initialized with the available directions. Wait, looking at the example, when the user is in the Living Room with directions south and west, the graph's edges for west are empty. Hmm, maybe the edges are bidirectional but represented as pairs. For example, if you go west from Living Room to Library, the edge west in Living Room points to Library, and the edge east in Library points back to Living Room. But in the example, the edges for west in Living Room are empty, but the edge west in Library is [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Wait, no, in the example, after moving west from Living Room to Library, the graph's edges for west in Living Room are empty? Wait, let me check the example again.\n\nIn the first example step: after moving west from Living Room to Library, the graph's edges are {\"north",
