Currently available directions: north, south. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and the directions between them are edges. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Media room with directions north and south. Let's assume the graph starts with just the Media room. The edges will be built as we explore. The first move should be to choose a direction, but since we don't know where those lead yet, maybe pick one arbitrarily. Let's say north first. But wait, maybe we need to plan ahead. However, since the user is asking for the next step each time, I need to make decisions step by step.\n\nWait, the example shows that each step adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. So each time we move, we add the new room to the nodes list and create edges between the current room and the new one based on the direction taken. For example, moving west from Living Room to Library adds an",
