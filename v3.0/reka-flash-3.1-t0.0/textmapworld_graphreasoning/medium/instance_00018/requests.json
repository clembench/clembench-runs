In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].

What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Sauna, and the available direction is east. The initial graph has just the Sauna node. The edges are empty except for the direction given. Wait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge is added in both directions? Let me check the example again.\n\nIn the example, when moving from Living Room to Library, the edge is added as west from Living Room to Library. Then when moving to Kitchen, the north edge from Library to Kitchen is added. So the edges are bidirectional? Because when you go from A to B, you add an edge from A to B and B to A? Wait, looking at the example's graph structure:\n\nIn the first step, the graph has nodes [\"Living Room\"], edges with west empty. Then after moving west to Library, the edges have west: [(\"Living Room\", \"Library\")]. Wait, but in the next step, when moving north from Library to Kitchen, the edges for north have [(\"Library\", \"Kitchen\")]. So the edges are stored as a list of tuples, but",
