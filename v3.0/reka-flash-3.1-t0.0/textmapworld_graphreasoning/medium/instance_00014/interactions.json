In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with \"DONE\" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\nHere is an example: \nYou are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\n{\"action\":\"GO: west\", \"graph\": {\"nodes\":[\"Living Room\"],\"edges\":{\"north\":[],\"south\":[],\"east\":[],\"west\":[]}}}\nYou have made a step and entered a Library.

This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Utility room with directions south and east. Let's assume the graph starts with just the Utility room. The edges for the Utility room would have south and east as possible directions, but since we haven't visited those rooms yet, the edges might be empty or need to be filled as we explore.\n\nWait, the example shows that when moving from Living Room to Library (west), the edge west in the graph for Living Room is connected to Library. So the graph is built incrementally as we move. Each time we move to a new room, we add that room to the nodes list and update the edges between the current room and the new one.\n\nSo, the initial state is in the Utility room. The available directions are south and east. Let's pick one. But which direction leads to the",
