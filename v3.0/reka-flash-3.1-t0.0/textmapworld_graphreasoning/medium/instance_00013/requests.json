Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {\"action\":\"GO: DIRECTION\",\"graph\":\"{\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}\"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west].

Currently available directions: west, east. What is your next instruction? <sep> assistant: <reasoning>\nLet's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is known for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\nFirst, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\n\nStarting in the Wine cellar with directions west and east. Let's assume the initial graph has just the Wine cellar node. The edges for west and east would be empty since we haven't explored those yet.\n\nThe first move should be to explore one of the directions. Since we want the fewest changes, maybe we should prioritize exploring one direction fully before backtracking. But BFS requires keeping track of visited nodes. Wait, but the problem is to visit all rooms with the fewest steps, so each step is a room change. So the total number of steps is the number of room changes. So the goal is to find the shortest path that covers all rooms. That's similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem, but here we want the minimal number of steps (edges) to visit all nodes (rooms).
