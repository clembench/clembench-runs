	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Dining room. Currently available directions: north. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible. So, I need to find the shortest path to explore every room. This sounds like a classic graph traversal problem, probably using BFS (Breadth-First Search) since BFS is good for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, I need to model the rooms as a graph. Each room is a node, and edges represent possible directions between rooms. The user will provide the current room and available directions each step. My job is to choose the next direction that leads to unvisited rooms, keeping track of the graph as I go.\\ \tt \\ \tt Starting in the Dining room with only north available. Let's say the first move is north. But wait, since there's only one direction, I have to go north. The graph starts with the Dining room. When I move north, I enter a new room, say Kitchen. Now, the graph has two nodes: Dining and Kitchen, connected north-south.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, but the example shows that edges are bidirectional. For instance, when moving west from Living Room to Library, the edge is added in both directions. So each time I move from A to B, I add an edge from A to B and B to A. That makes sense because moving back is possible.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, the initial state is Dining room. Available directions: north. So the first action must be to go north. The graph
