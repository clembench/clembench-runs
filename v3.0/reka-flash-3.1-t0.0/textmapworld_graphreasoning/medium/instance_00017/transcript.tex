	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room, you need to decide the direction to go in and additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: To move to a neighboring room, use {"action":"GO: DIRECTION","graph":"{"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}"}} and replace DIRECTION with one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, answer with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt You are in the Living Room. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: west", "graph": {"nodes":["Living Room"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Library. Currently available directions: east, north. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "graph":{"nodes":["Living Room", "Library"],"edges":{"north":[],"south":[],"east":[],"west":[("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Kitchen. Currently available directions: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: east", "graph":{"nodes": ["Living Room", "Library", "Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [("Library", "Kitchen")],"south": [],"east": [],"west": [("Living Room", "Library")]}}}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt You have made a step and entered a Bedroom. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action": "DONE", "graph": {...}}\\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt You are in the Closet. Currently available directions: south, west. What is your next instruction?

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this problem. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I approach this?\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the user starts in the Closet, which is the initial room. The available directions are south and west. The example given shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. The graph needs to represent the map as it's being uncovered.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the problem mentions "the fewest number of room changes possible." That sounds like finding the shortest path to visit all rooms, which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe for a small number of rooms, a backtracking approach could work. However, since the user is exploring step by step, perhaps a breadth-first search (BFS) approach would be better to explore all possibilities level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\\ \tt \\ \tt But how do I model this? Each state would be the current room and the set of visited rooms. The goal is to visit all rooms with the least steps. So, BFS can track the number of steps taken and the rooms visited. Once all rooms are visited, that's the shortest path.\\ \tt \\ \tt But since the user is making moves step by step, I need to simulate this exploration. The assistant has to choose directions that lead towards unvisited
