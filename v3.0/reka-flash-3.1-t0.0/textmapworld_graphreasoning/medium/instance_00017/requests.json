The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. So, I need to figure out a path that covers all rooms in the least steps. But how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the user starts in the Closet, which is the initial room. The available directions are south and west. The example given shows that each move adds the new room to the graph and updates the edges. The graph needs to represent the map as it's being uncovered.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"the fewest number of room changes possible.\" That sounds like finding the shortest path to visit all rooms, which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). But TSP is NP-hard, so maybe for a small number of rooms, a backtracking approach could work. However, since the user is exploring step by step, perhaps a breadth-first search (BFS) approach would be better to explore all possibilities level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nBut how do I model this? Each state would be the current room and the set of visited rooms. The goal is to visit all rooms with the least steps. So, BFS can track the number of steps taken and the rooms visited. Once all rooms are visited, that's the shortest path.\n\nBut since the user is making moves step by step, I need to simulate this exploration. The assistant has to choose directions that lead towards unvisited",
