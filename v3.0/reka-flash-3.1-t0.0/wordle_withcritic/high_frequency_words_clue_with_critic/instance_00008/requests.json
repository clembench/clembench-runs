First, I need to figure out what TV show started on January 14, 1952. Let me think about classic TV shows from that era.\n\nJanuary 14, 1952... Hmm, I remember that \"I Love Lucy\" premiered in 1951, but maybe that's too early. Wait, another show that comes to mind is \"The Lone Ranger,\" but I'm not sure about the date. Alternatively, \"Howdy Doody\" was a popular children's show in the 1950s. Let me check the dates. Howdy Doody started in 1947, so that's before 1952. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\"? No, that was in the 50s but not sure about the exact date. Another possibility is \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" but that started in 1960. Let me think again. Oh! \"The Lone Ranger\" actually premiered in 1949, so that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Honeymooners\"? That started in 1955. Hmm. Let me check another angle. The date 1/14/52. Maybe it's a show that started on that exact date. Let me recall. Oh! \"The Lone Ranger\" actually had a revival in 1958, but the original was ",
