	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tv show since 1/14/52

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "tv show since 1/14/52". First, I need to figure out what TV show started on January 14, 1952. Let me think about classic TV shows from that era.\\ \tt \\ \tt January 14, 1952... Hmm, I remember that "I Love Lucy" premiered in 1951, but maybe that's too early. Wait, another show that comes to mind is "The Lone Ranger," but I'm not sure about the date. Alternatively, "Howdy Doody" was a popular children's show in the 1950s. Let me check the dates. Howdy Doody started in 1947, so that's before 1952. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"? No, that was in the 50s but not sure about the exact date. Another possibility is "The Andy Griffith Show," but that started in 1960. Let me think again. Oh! "The Lone Ranger" actually premiered in 1949, so that's not it. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe "The Honeymooners"? That started in 1955. Hmm. Let me check another angle. The date 1/14/52. Maybe it's a show that started on that exact date. Let me recall. Oh! "The Lone Ranger" actually had a revival in 1958, but the original was
