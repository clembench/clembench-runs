First, I need to figure out what song or album by the band Heart was a hit in 1985. Heart is a famous rock band, sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. Let me think about their hits from that era.\n\nIn the mid-80s, Heart had some big hits. Wait, \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" by Joy Division was a hit in the early 80s, but that's not Heart. Let me recall. Oh, \"These Dreams\" was a big hit for them in 1985. Let me check: \"These Dreams\" was released in 1985 as part of their album \"Masquerade\". The single reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. That seems right. The song is definitely associated with Heart and 1985. \n\nNow, the target word is five letters. \"These\" is five letters, but \"These\" is the word from the song title. Wait, the clue says \"hit by Heart\", so the song title might be the key. The song is \"These Dreams\", so the word \"these\" is five letters. But the target word in Wordle is five letters. Let me confirm: \"These\" is T-H-E-S-E. That's five letters. So maybe the answer is \"these\"? \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other 1985 hit",
