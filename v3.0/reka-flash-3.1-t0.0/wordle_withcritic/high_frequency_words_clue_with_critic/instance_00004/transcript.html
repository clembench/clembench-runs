        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: &quot;snowy white&quot;<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br/>1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own<br/>2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: 1985 hit by heart</p>

        <p>&lt;reasoning&gt;<br/>Let&#x27;s tackle this Wordle with the clue &quot;1985 hit by Heart&quot;. First, I need to figure out what song or album by the band Heart was a hit in 1985. Heart is a famous rock band, sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. Let me think about their hits from that era.<br/><br/>In the mid-80s, Heart had some big hits. Wait, &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; by Joy Division was a hit in the early 80s, but that&#x27;s not Heart. Let me recall. Oh, &quot;These Dreams&quot; was a big hit for them in 1985. Let me check: &quot;These Dreams&quot; was released in 1985 as part of their album &quot;Masquerade&quot;. The single reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. That seems right. The song is definitely associated with Heart and 1985. <br/><br/>Now, the target word is five letters. &quot;These&quot; is five letters, but &quot;These&quot; is the word from the song title. Wait, the clue says &quot;hit by Heart&quot;, so the song title might be the key. The song is &quot;These Dreams&quot;, so the word &quot;these&quot; is five letters. But the target word in Wordle is five letters. Let me confirm: &quot;These&quot; is T-H-E-S-E. That&#x27;s five letters. So maybe the answer is &quot;these&quot;? <br/><br/>Wait, but let me make sure there&#x27;s no other 1985 hit</p>
