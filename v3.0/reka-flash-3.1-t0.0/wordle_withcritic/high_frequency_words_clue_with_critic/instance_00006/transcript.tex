	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tv's"___dad"

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "tv's"___dad". The clue is a bit cryptic. The user mentioned it's similar to the example where "Snow White" led to "apple". So maybe I need to think of a TV show or a phrase that fits the pattern "tv's" followed by three letters and then "dad".\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "tv's" probably refers to a TV show or a character from a TV show. The structure is "tv's" followed by three letters and "dad". So the full word would be "tv's" + three letters + "dad". Wait, but the target word is five letters. Wait, the example had "apple" which is five letters. The clue here is "tv's"___dad". Let me parse that. Maybe the clue is structured as "tv's" followed by three letters and then "dad", but the actual word is five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is a play on words. For example, "tv's" could be part of a title, and the three letters are part of the show's name, ending with "dad".\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe "tv's" is a contraction. Let's think of TV shows that have "dad" in their title. For example, "Full House" has a dad, but that's not matching. Wait, "Modern Family" has a dad, but again, not matching. Alternatively, maybe "
