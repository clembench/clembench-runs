	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: gauge reading

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "gauge reading". First, I need to understand what the clue refers to. A gauge reading is the measurement shown by a gauge, like a speedometer or a thermometer. So the target word is probably related to measuring something.\\ \tt \\ \tt The word has to be five letters. Let's think of common five-letter words related to gauges. Words like "meter" come to mind, but that's six letters. Maybe "gauge" itself? Wait, "gauge" is five letters. But the clue is "gauge reading", so maybe the word is part of that phrase. Alternatively, maybe a word that's part of a term related to gauge readings. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "gauge reading" could be a term in engineering or physics. Words like "measure" are too long. Maybe "scale"? No, that's five letters but not directly related. "Read" is part of "reading", but "read" is four letters. "Gauge" itself is five letters. Let me check if "gauge" is a valid Wordle word. Yes, it is. But does the clue point to "gauge"? The clue says "gauge reading", so maybe the answer is "gauge". But maybe there's another word. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other terms. "Pressure" is six letters. "Voltage" is seven. "Thermo" is five letters but not
