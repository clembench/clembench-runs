	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: others'

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "others'". The clue is possessive, so it's "others'". The target word is a five-letter English word. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "others'" in possessive form usually ends with an apostrophe and an's', but since we need a five-letter word, maybe the apostrophe is part of the word? Wait, but in English, the possessive of "others" is "others'", which is six characters including the apostrophe. But the target word is five letters. Hmm, maybe the clue is hinting at a word related to "others" in a different way. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a play on words. Let me think of possible five-letter words that relate to "others".\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe "others'" is a clue pointing to a word that means "another" or "different". Words like "other", but that's five letters. Wait, "other" is five letters. Let me check: O-T-H-E-R. Yes, that's five letters. But does "others'" relate to "other"? Well, "others" is plural possessive, but "other" is the adjective. Maybe the clue is using "others'" to hint at "other". Let me see if "other" is a valid word. Yes, it is. But is that the intended clue?\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the clue is "others'" as in the
