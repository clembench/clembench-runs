	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: winter wear

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "winter wear". The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to think about what "winter wear" refers to. Winter wear typically includes clothing items like coats, jackets, sweaters, scarves, hats, etc. Since it's a five-letter word, maybe something shorter.\\ \tt \\ \tt Looking at common winter wear terms. "Coat" is five letters, but maybe too obvious. "Sweat" is five letters but maybe not specific enough. "Scarf" is five letters. "Hoodi" is a hooded sweatshirt, but that's five letters. Wait, "hoodi" is five letters. But is that a valid English word? Maybe "hoodie" is the full term, but the clue says five letters. Alternatively, "jacket" is six letters. "Sweat" is five letters. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe "mitts" for mittens? That's five letters. "Boots" is five letters. "Gloves" is six. "Socks" is five. "Parka" is five. "Fleece" is six. "Beanie" is six. "Sweat" is possible. Let's check if "sweat" fits. The clue is winter wear, so sweat could refer to a sweatshirt. But maybe "sweat" is too generic. Alternatively, "
