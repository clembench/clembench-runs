Winter wear typically includes clothing items like coats, jackets, sweaters, scarves, hats, etc. Since it's a five-letter word, maybe something shorter.\n\nLooking at common winter wear terms. \"Coat\" is five letters, but maybe too obvious. \"Sweat\" is five letters but maybe not specific enough. \"Scarf\" is five letters. \"Hoodi\" is a hooded sweatshirt, but that's five letters.

That's five letters. \"Boots\" is five letters. \"Gloves\" is six. \"Socks\" is five. \"Parka\" is five. \"Fleece\" is six. \"Beanie\" is six. \"Sweat\" is possible. Let's check if \"sweat\" fits.
