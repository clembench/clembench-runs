First, I need to understand what \"virile\" means. It refers to someone or something that is full of vigor, strength, or sexual energy. So the target word is a five-letter English word related to these qualities.\n\nSince the clue is an adjective, maybe the word itself is a noun that embodies virility. Words like \"manly\", \"strong\", \"power\", \"vigor\", but those are longer than five letters. Let's think of five-letter words. \"Vigor\" is five letters, but does that fit? \"Vigor\" means energy and strength, which relates to virile. Alternatively, \"stout\" (strong), \"hearty\", but that's six letters. \"Might\" is five letters, but does that capture virility? Maybe not as directly.\n\nAnother angle: \"virile\" often relates to masculinity. Words like \"masculine\", but that's too long. \"Male\" is three letters. \"Manly\" is five letters. \"Manly\" could be a candidate. Let's check if \"manly\" is a valid Wordle word. Yes, it is. But does \"manly\" fit the clue \"virile\"? It does, as it's associated with masculinity and strength.\n\nAlternatively, \"vital\" (five letters) means essential for life, which is related but not exactly the same. \"",
