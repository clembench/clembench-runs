You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: virile",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle with the clue \"virile\". First, I need to understand what \"virile\" means. It refers to someone or something that is full of vigor, strength, or sexual energy. So the target word is a five-letter English word related to these qualities.\n\nSince the clue is an adjective, maybe the word itself is a noun that embodies virility. Words like \"manly\", \"strong\", \"power\", \"vigor\", but those are longer than five letters. Let's think of five-letter words. \"Vigor\" is five letters, but does that fit? \"Vigor\" means energy and strength, which relates to virile. Alternatively, \"stout\" (strong), \"hearty\", but that's six letters. \"Might\" is five letters, but does that capture virility? Maybe not as directly.\n\nAnother angle: \"virile\" often relates to masculinity. Words like \"masculine\", but that's too long. \"Male\" is three letters. \"Manly\" is five letters. \"Manly\" could be a candidate. Let's check if \"manly\" is a valid Wordle word. Yes, it is. But does \"manly\" fit the clue \"virile\"? It does, as it's associated with masculinity and strength.\n\nAlternatively, \"vital\" (five letters) means essential for life, which is related but not exactly the same. \"",
