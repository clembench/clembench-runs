The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to break down the clue. \"Nine-to-five\" refers to a standard workday, usually from 9 AM to 5 PM. \"Routine\" suggests something habitual or recurring. So the word might relate to a common activity or term associated with a typical workday.\n\nLooking for five-letter words that fit. Maybe \"office\" comes to mind, but that's six letters. \"Shift\" is five letters. Does \"shift\" relate to a nine-to-five routine? Maybe, as shifts are part of work routines. Alternatively, \"clock\" could be a possibility, but not sure. \"Break\" is five letters, but maybe too generic. \"Board\" is five letters, but not directly related. \"Paper\" is five letters, but again, not specific.\n\nWait, \"routine\" itself is seven letters. Maybe a shorter form. \"Routin\" is not a word. \"Daily\" is five letters, but \"daily routine\" is part of the clue. \"Daily\" might be a stretch. Let's think of other terms. \"Job\" is too short. \"Work\" is four letters. \"Task\" is four. \"Duty\" is five letters. \"Duty\" could fit, but does it relate to nine-to-five? Maybe not directly.\n\nAnother angle: \"nine-to",
