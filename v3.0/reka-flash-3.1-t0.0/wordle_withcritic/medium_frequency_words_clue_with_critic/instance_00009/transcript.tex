	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: waffle topping

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "waffle topping". The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to think about common waffle toppings. The most obvious ones are things like syrup, chocolate, whipped cream, berries, nuts, etc. But those are longer than five letters. Maybe I should think of specific toppings that are single words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "maple" is a syrup, but that's five letters. Let me check: M-A-P-L-E. Yes, that's five letters. But is "maple" a common waffle topping? I think syrup flavors like maple are definitely used. Alternatively, "choco" is too short. "Nutella" is longer. Maybe "cocoa"? That's five letters. Cocoa is a powder used in toppings, but maybe not as common as syrup. \\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: think of words that describe toppings. "Sprink" is part of sprinkles, but that's five letters. "Sprinkles" is too long. "Stawb" is strawberry, but that's not a topping. "Berry" is five letters but maybe not a topping. "Whip" is part of whipped cream, but that's four letters. "Cream" is five letters, but "whipped cream" is two words. Maybe "cream" alone? But is that considered a topping? Maybe. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue is "waffle topping", so the
