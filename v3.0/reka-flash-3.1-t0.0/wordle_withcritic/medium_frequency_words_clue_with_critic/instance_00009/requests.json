The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to think about common waffle toppings. The most obvious ones are things like syrup, chocolate, whipped cream, berries, nuts, etc. But those are longer than five letters. Maybe I should think of specific toppings that are single words.\n\nWait, \"maple\" is a syrup, but that's five letters. Let me check: M-A-P-L-E. Yes, that's five letters. But is \"maple\" a common waffle topping? I think syrup flavors like maple are definitely used. Alternatively, \"choco\" is too short. \"Nutella\" is longer. Maybe \"cocoa\"? That's five letters. Cocoa is a powder used in toppings, but maybe not as common as syrup. \n\nAnother angle: think of words that describe toppings. \"Sprink\" is part of sprinkles, but that's five letters. \"Sprinkles\" is too long. \"Stawb\" is strawberry, but that's not a topping. \"Berry\" is five letters but maybe not a topping. \"Whip\" is part of whipped cream, but that's four letters. \"Cream\" is five letters, but \"whipped cream\" is two words.
