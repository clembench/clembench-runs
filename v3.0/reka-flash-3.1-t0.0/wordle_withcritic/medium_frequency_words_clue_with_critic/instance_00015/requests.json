I need to find a five-letter word related to a passenger ship. First, I'll brainstorm words associated with passenger ships. Words like \"liner\", \"ferry\", \"cruise\", \"voyage\", \"deck\", \"stateroom\", \"voyage\", \"voyage\" again... Maybe \"voyage\" is too long. Let's see.\n\n\"Passenger ship\" – maybe the term \"liner\" comes to mind. A passenger liner is a ship designed for carrying passengers. \"Liner\" is five letters? Wait, \"liner\" is six letters. Hmm. Maybe \"cruise\" is a term, but that's six letters too. \"Ferry\" is five letters. A ferry is a type of passenger ship, right? So \"ferry\" could be a candidate. Let me check if \"ferry\" is a valid five-letter word. Yes, it is. But does it fit the clue? A ferry is a passenger ship, so that works. Alternatively, \"liner\" is too long. What about \"steamer\"? That's seven letters. \"Yacht\" is five letters but not a passenger ship. \"Voyage\" is too long. \"Deck\" is five letters but part of a ship, not the ship itself. \"Hull\" is too short. \"Sail\" is too short. \"Cabin\" is",
