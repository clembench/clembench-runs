	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: shrewd

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "shrewd". First, I need to understand what "shrewd" means. It describes someone who is clever, perceptive, and quick to understand things, often in a practical way. So the target word is a five-letter English word related to being shrewd or sharp-witted.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, starting with the clue, maybe the word itself is a synonym or a part of the word "shrewd". Let's break down "shrewd". The root might be "shrew", which is a small, fierce-looking mammal, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, "shrewd" could relate to sharpness, like a sharp mind. So maybe words like "sharp", "clever", "smart", "acute", "prick" (though that's more about spines), or "quick". But these are all more than five letters. Wait, the target is five letters. Let's think of five-letter words that convey shrewdness.\\ \tt \\ \tt Possible candidates: "sharp" (5 letters), "clever" (6 letters, too long), "acute" (5 letters), "prick" (5 letters but not exactly shrewd), "quick" (5 letters). Let's check if these are valid words. "Sharp" is definitely a valid word. "Acute" can mean sharp in intellect. "Quick" relates to speed
