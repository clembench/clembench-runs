You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: like venture capital investments",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle with the clue \"like venture capital investments\". Venture capital investments are typically in startups that have high growth potential but are also high-risk. So the word should relate to that concept.\n\nFirst, I need a five-letter word. Let's think of synonyms or related terms. Words like \"start\", \"risk\", \"grow\", \"fund\", \"seed\", \"angel\", \"capital\", \"invest\", \"entrepreneur\". But \"angel\" is five letters. Wait, \"angel\" is a possible candidate. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, \"angel\" is a five-letter word. But does it fit the clue? Angels are investors in venture capital, so maybe. Alternatively, \"funds\" is five letters but plural. \"Fund\" is four letters. \"Start\" is five letters. \"Start\" relates to starting a company, which is part of venture capital. Another angle: venture capital terms like \"equity\", but that's six letters. \"Stake\" is five letters. \"Stake\" refers to an investment stake. \"Stake\" could work. Let's see. \"Stake\" is a possible guess. Alternatively, \"angel\" is more direct. Let me think. The clue is \"like venture capital investments\", so maybe the word is a metaphor. \"Angel\" as an investor, \"stake\" as an investment. Both are possible. Let's check frequency",
