Venture capital investments are typically in startups that have high growth potential but are also high-risk. So the word should relate to that concept.\n\nFirst, I need a five-letter word. Let's think of synonyms or related terms. Words like \"start\", \"risk\", \"grow\", \"fund\", \"seed\", \"angel\", \"capital\", \"invest\", \"entrepreneur\". But \"angel\" is five letters. Wait, \"angel\" is a possible candidate. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, \"angel\" is a five-letter word. But does it fit the clue? Angels are investors in venture capital, so maybe. Alternatively, \"funds\" is five letters but plural. \"Fund\" is four letters. \"Start\" is five letters. \"Start\" relates to starting a company, which is part of venture capital. Another angle: venture capital terms like \"equity\", but that's six letters. \"Stake\" is five letters. \"Stake\" refers to an investment stake. \"Stake\" could work. Let's see. \"Stake\" is a possible guess. Alternatively, \"angel\" is more direct. Let me think. The clue is \"like venture capital investments\", so maybe the word is a metaphor. \"Angel\" as an investor, \"stake\" as an investment. Both are possible. Let's check frequency",
