First, I need to understand what the clue refers to. \"Tend the hearth\" is an old-fashioned phrase meaning to take care of a home, maybe tending a fireplace. So the target word is likely related to home, fire, or hearth.\n\nThe example given in the problem used a fairy tale reference, so maybe this clue is similar. Let me think of words associated with tending a hearth. Words like \"fire\", \"flame\", \"hearth\", \"ember\", \"broom\" (for sweeping ashes), \"stove\", \"grate\", \"ash\", \"log\", \"kindle\". But these are all longer than five letters. Wait, the target is a five-letter word.\n\nLooking for five-letter words related to hearth. \"Hearth\" itself is six letters. Maybe \"ember\" (five letters)? Let's check: E-M-B-E-R. Yes, that's five letters. But does \"ember\" fit the clue? Tending the hearth would involve embers. Alternatively, \"flame\" is five letters, but \"flame\" is five letters. \"Flame\" relates to fire, which is part of tending the hearth. Another possibility is \"broom\" (five letters), but that's more about cleaning. \"Stove\" is five letters, but maybe less directly related.",
