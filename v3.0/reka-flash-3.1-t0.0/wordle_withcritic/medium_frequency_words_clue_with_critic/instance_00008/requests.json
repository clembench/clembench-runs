The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to understand what \"make current\" means. \"Current\" can refer to electricity, but maybe here it's more about making something standard or established. So, \"make current\" might mean to establish as the standard or present.\n\nLooking for a five-letter word that relates to making something current. Words like \"adopt\" (to take on), \"adopt\" is five letters. Wait, \"adopt\" – does that fit? Let me think. \"Adopt\" means to take in, but does it relate to making current? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, \"adopt\" could be a stretch. Let's see other possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: \"make current\" could be a phrase that's a single word. Maybe \"current\" is part of the word. Words like \"current\" itself is seven letters, too long. Maybe \"stream\" (as in flowing, like electricity), but \"stream\" is five letters. Does \"stream\" relate to making current? Not sure. Alternatively, \"charge\" – but that's six letters. Wait, \"charge\" is six letters. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"adopt\" is the right word. Let me check. \"Adopt\" – A-D-O-P-T. If the clue is \"make current\", maybe \"adopt\" is the action of making something standard. Alternatively, \"",
