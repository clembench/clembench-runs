A baby conveyance could be something like a stroller, a pram, a carriage, or maybe even a baby carrier. Since the target is a five-letter word, I need to think of five-letter terms related to baby transport.\n\nLet me brainstorm possible words. Stroller is too long (7 letters). Prawn is a fish, not a baby thing. Pram is a British term for stroller, but that's four letters. Carriage is too long. Baby carrier might be a term, but again, too long. Wait, maybe \"cot\" but that's a crib. \"Buggy\" is a type of stroller, but that's five letters. Let me check: B-U-G-G-Y. Yes, that's five letters. Does \"buggy\" fit the clue? A buggy is a baby conveyance. Alternatively, \"stroller\" is too long. What about \"cot\" or \"crib\"? Not exactly conveyances. Maybe \"pram\" is four letters. Wait, \"pram\" is a stroller, but it's four letters. The target is five letters. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: \"baby conveyance\" could also refer to a baby carriage, but that's longer. Maybe \"stroller\" is the closest, but it's seven letters. Wait, maybe \"",
