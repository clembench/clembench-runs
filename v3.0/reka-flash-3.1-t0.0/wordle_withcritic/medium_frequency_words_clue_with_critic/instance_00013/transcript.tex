	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: baby conveyance

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "baby conveyance." First, I need to understand what the clue means. A baby conveyance could be something like a stroller, a pram, a carriage, or maybe even a baby carrier. Since the target is a five-letter word, I need to think of five-letter terms related to baby transport.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me brainstorm possible words. Stroller is too long (7 letters). Prawn is a fish, not a baby thing. Pram is a British term for stroller, but that's four letters. Carriage is too long. Baby carrier might be a term, but again, too long. Wait, maybe "cot" but that's a crib. "Buggy" is a type of stroller, but that's five letters. Let me check: B-U-G-G-Y. Yes, that's five letters. Does "buggy" fit the clue? A buggy is a baby conveyance. Alternatively, "stroller" is too long. What about "cot" or "crib"? Not exactly conveyances. Maybe "pram" is four letters. Wait, "pram" is a stroller, but it's four letters. The target is five letters. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "baby conveyance" could also refer to a baby carriage, but that's longer. Maybe "stroller" is the closest, but it's seven letters. Wait, maybe "
