You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: stand in (for)",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle with the clue \"stand in (for)\". The user mentioned that the clue is \"stand in (for)\", so I need to figure out what word that refers to. \"Stand in for\" usually means to substitute or take the place of someone. So maybe the target word is related to substitution or replacement.\n\nFirst, I should think of words that mean substitute or replacement. Words like \"substitute\", \"replace\", \"standby\", \"proxy\", \"deputy\", \"surrogate\". But the target is a five-letter word. Let's check the lengths. \"Substitute\" is too long. \"Replace\" is 7 letters. \"Standby\" is 7. \"Proxy\" is 5 letters. \"Deputy\" is 6. \"Surrogate\" is 8. Hmm, \"proxy\" is 5 letters. But does \"stand in for\" directly relate to \"proxy\"? Maybe not directly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clue is a play on words. \"Stand in for\" could be a phrase that's abbreviated or has a hidden word. Let's break it down. \"Stand in for\" â€“ maybe the letters in the clue form the answer. Let's see: S-T-A-N-D-I-N-F-O-R. That's a lot of letters. Maybe a five-letter word formed by combining parts of the clue. Alternatively, think of idioms or phrases where \"",
