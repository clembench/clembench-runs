The clue is \"...called for his fiddlers ___\". I need to figure out a five-letter word that fits here. The blank is five letters, so the phrase is something like \"called for his fiddlers [five-letter word]\".\n\nFirst, I'll think of common phrases or idioms that fit this structure. The phrase \"called for his fiddlers\" might be part of a longer saying. Wait, I remember there's a saying like \"the last straw\" or \"the final straw\", but how does that connect? Wait, maybe \"called for his fiddlers three\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"called for his fiddlers three\" is part of a song or a quote. Wait, the clue is \"...called for his fiddlers ___\". Let me think. Oh! There's a famous line from a story or song that goes \"called for his fiddlers three\". Let me check. Yes! The line is from the story \"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\". In the story, when the rats are gone, the piper is rewarded, and he says, \"Then called for his fiddlers three.\" So the blank here is \"three\". But \"three\" is five letters? Wait, \"three\" is five letters: T-H-R-E-E. Yes, that's correct. So the target word is \"three\".\n\nWait",
