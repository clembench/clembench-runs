The clue is possessive, so it's \"others'\". The target word is a five-letter English word. First, I need to think about words related to \"others\" that are five letters.\n\n\"Others\" itself is six letters. Maybe a part of it? Let's see. \"Other\" is five letters, but the clue is \"others'\". The possessive form would be \"others'\" but that's not a word. Wait, maybe the clue is hinting at a word that relates to \"others\" in some way. Alternatively, maybe it's a play on words. For example, \"others'\" could be a possessive form, but perhaps the word is \"other\" with an apostrophe, but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the clue is pointing to a word that means \"belonging to others\" or \"another person's\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clue is a hint towards a word that's a homophone or has a connection. Let me think. \"Others'\" could be pronounced like \"awthers\" but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the word is \"other\" but with an apostrophe, but that's not a valid five-letter word. Alternatively, maybe the clue is \"others'\" as in the plural possessive, but how does that translate to a five-letter word?\n\nWait, maybe the clue is a red h",
