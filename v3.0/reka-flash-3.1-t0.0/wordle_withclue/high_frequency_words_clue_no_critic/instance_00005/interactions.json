You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: divine ___",

The clue is \"divine ___\", so maybe it's a phrase or a compound word. \"Divine\" itself is five letters, so the blank is the sixth letter? The target is a five-letter word. The clue is \"divine ___\", so maybe the word is \"divine\" plus another word, but the target is five letters. Maybe the clue is hinting at a word that relates to \"divine\" in some way.\n\nWait, the clue is \"divine ___\", so perhaps the target word is \"divine\" followed by a single letter? But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the clue is a three-word phrase where the middle word is missing. Like \"divine [something]\". For example, \"divine intervention\" but that's more than five letters. Wait, the target is a five-letter word. So maybe the clue is \"divine\" followed by a three-letter word? No, the target is five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is \"divine\" as the first part, and the blank is the last letter. So the word is \"divin\" plus one more letter. So the word starts with \"divin\" and ends with a fifth letter. So possible words could be \"divine\" (",
