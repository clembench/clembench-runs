The clue is \"1985 hit by heart.\" First, I need to figure out what song or artist this refers to. The year 1985 and the band Heart. Heart is a famous rock band, especially known for their hits in the 70s and 80s. Let me think of their big hits around 1985.\n\nWait, \"Barracuda\" was a huge hit for them in 1977. But that's too early. Maybe another song? Oh, \"Magic Man\" was a hit in 1975. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"These Dreams\" from 1985? Let me check. Yes, \"These Dreams\" was released in 1985 as part of their album \"Bad Animals.\" It was a major hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is definitely associated with Heart, especially Ann Wilson's vocals. \n\nSo the song title is \"These Dreams.\" The target word is five letters. Let's see: \"these\" is five letters. But the song title is \"These Dreams,\" which is more than five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is referring to the band's name, but \"Heart\" is four letters. Alternatively, maybe the song title has a five-letter word. Let's break it down. \"These\" is five letters, \"dreams\" is six. Maybe \"magic\" from \"Magic Man\"? No",
