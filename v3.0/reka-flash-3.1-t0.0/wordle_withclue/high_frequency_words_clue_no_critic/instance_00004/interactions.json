You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: 1985 hit by heart",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle puzzle. The clue is \"1985 hit by heart.\" First, I need to figure out what song or artist this refers to. The year 1985 and the band Heart. Heart is a famous rock band, especially known for their hits in the 70s and 80s. Let me think of their big hits around 1985.\n\nWait, \"Barracuda\" was a huge hit for them in 1977. But that's too early. Maybe another song? Oh, \"Magic Man\" was a hit in 1975. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"These Dreams\" from 1985? Let me check. Yes, \"These Dreams\" was released in 1985 as part of their album \"Bad Animals.\" It was a major hit, reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is definitely associated with Heart, especially Ann Wilson's vocals. \n\nSo the song title is \"These Dreams.\" The target word is five letters. Let's see: \"these\" is five letters. But the song title is \"These Dreams,\" which is more than five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is referring to the band's name, but \"Heart\" is four letters. Alternatively, maybe the song title has a five-letter word. Let's break it down. \"These\" is five letters, \"dreams\" is six. Maybe \"magic\" from \"Magic Man\"? No",
