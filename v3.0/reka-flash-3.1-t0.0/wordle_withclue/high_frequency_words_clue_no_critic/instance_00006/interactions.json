You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: tv's\"___dad\"",

So, the target word is a five-letter word that fits into the blank in the phrase \"tv's ___ dad\". The apostrophe in \"tv's\" probably stands for \"television's\", so the phrase is \"television's ___ dad\". The blank is three letters because \"tv's\" is four letters (t, v, s, apostrophe?), but maybe the structure is different. Let me think.\n\nWait, the clue is written as \"tv's\"___dad\". So the structure is \"tv's\" followed by a three-letter word, then \"dad\". So the total would be \"tv's\" + 3 letters + \"dad\" = \"tv's___dad\". Let's count the letters. \"tv's\" is 4 characters (t, v, ', s), then three letters, then \"dad\" (3 letters). So the total length is 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 characters. But the target word is five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is structured differently. Maybe it's \"tv's\" followed by a three-letter word, and then \"dad\" is part of the clue, but the target word is the three-letter word. Wait, the user says the target word is a five-letter word. Wait, the example given earlier had the clue \"snowy white\" leading to \"",
