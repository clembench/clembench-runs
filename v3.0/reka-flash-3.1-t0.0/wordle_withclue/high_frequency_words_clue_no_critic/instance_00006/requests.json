The clue given is \"tv's\"___dad\". So, the target word is a five-letter word that fits into the blank in the phrase \"tv's ___ dad\". The apostrophe in \"tv's\" probably stands for \"television's\", so the phrase is \"television's ___ dad\". The blank is three letters because \"tv's\" is four letters (t, v, s, apostrophe?), but maybe the structure is different. Let me think.\n\nWait, the clue is written as \"tv's\"___dad\". So the structure is \"tv's\" followed by a three-letter word, then \"dad\". So the total would be \"tv's\" + 3 letters + \"dad\" = \"tv's___dad\". Let's count the letters. \"tv's\" is 4 characters (t, v, ', s), then three letters, then \"dad\" (3 letters). So the total length is 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 characters. But the target word is five letters. Wait, maybe the clue is structured differently. Maybe it's \"tv's\" followed by a three-letter word, and then \"dad\" is part of the clue, but the target word is the three-letter word. Wait, the user says the target word is a five-letter word. Wait, the example given earlier had the clue \"snowy white\" leading to \"",
