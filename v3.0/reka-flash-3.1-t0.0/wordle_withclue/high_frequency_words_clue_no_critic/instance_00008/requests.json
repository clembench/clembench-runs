The clue is \"tv show since 1/14/52\". First, I need to figure out which TV show started on January 14, 1952. Let me think about classic TV shows from that era.\n\nWait, January 14, 1952... That's a specific date. Maybe it's a show that's been around a long time. Let me recall. I know that \"I Love Lucy\" started in 1951, but not sure about the exact date. Wait, \"The Lone Ranger\" was a radio show first, then a TV show. The TV version started in 1954, so that's later. \n\nAnother thought: \"The Twilight Zone\" premiered in 1959. \"Howdy Doody\" was a children's show in the 1940s and 50s. Wait, \"Howdy Doody\" started in 1947. Maybe \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" began in 1946. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe \"The Lone Ranger\" TV series started in 1954. Not matching. Let me check another angle. The date 1/14/52. Maybe the show's title relates to that date? Or perhaps the show's name has numbers in it? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the show's premiere date is a clue. Let me think of TV shows that started in 1952. \n\n",
