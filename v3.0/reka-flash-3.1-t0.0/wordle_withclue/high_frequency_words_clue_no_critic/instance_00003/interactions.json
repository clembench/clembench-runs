You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red).

The Supreme Court justices are typically referred to by their last names, like Roberts, Scalia, Breyer, etc. Since it's a five-letter word, I need to find a last name that's five letters long and fits the clue of being a longtime justice.\n\nFirst, let's list some long-serving Supreme Court justices. Antonin Scalia served for a long time until his death in 2016. He's a five-letter name? Wait, Scalia is six letters. John Roberts is the current Chief Justice, but that's seven letters. Clarence Thomas is eight letters. Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a notable justice, but her last name is eight letters. Wait, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, maybe the clue is referring to a former justice. Let's think. William Rehnquist was Chief Justice for a long time, but his last name is eight letters. Sandra Day O'Connor is nine letters. Wait, maybe the first names? But the clue says \"name,\" which usually refers to last names. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the clue is a bit more creative. \"Longtime supreme court name\" could be a nickname or a term. Wait, \"Supreme Court name\" might refer to a title or a position.
