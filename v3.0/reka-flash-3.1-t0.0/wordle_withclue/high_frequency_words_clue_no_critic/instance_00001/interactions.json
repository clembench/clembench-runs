You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: comatose",

So maybe the target word is related to that concept. But the target is a five-letter word. Let's break it down.\n\nThe clue is \"comatose\", which is 7 letters. Maybe the target word is a shorter form or a part of that word. Let's see: \"coma\" is part of \"comatose\", but \"coma\" is four letters. The target needs to be five letters. Alternatively, maybe a synonym or related term. Words like \"unconscious\", \"asleep\", \"stupor\", but those are longer. Wait, maybe the target is a part of \"comatose\" but rearranged? Let's check letters: C, O, M, A, T, O, S, E. Five letters needed. Maybe \"motes\" (from \"mote\" but not sure). Alternatively, think of other words related to being unconscious. \"Dazed\", \"drunk\", \"stupor\" is too long. Maybe \"stun\" but that's four letters. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the clue is a hint towards a different approach. \"Comatose\" could be a play on letters. Let's look for five-letter words that include letters from \"comatose\". For",
