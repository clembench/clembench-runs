	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: sweetheart

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "sweetheart". First, I need to understand what "sweetheart" refers to. It's a term of endearment for someone you love, often a romantic partner. The target word is a five-letter English word.\\ \tt \\ \tt So, thinking of words related to sweetheart. Maybe words like "love", "heart", "sweet", "cupid", "angel", "darling", "babe", "honey", "kiss", "cherish". But all these are either too short or too long. Wait, the target is five letters. Let's see. "Heart" is five letters. But does "heart" relate to sweetheart? Yes, because sweetheart often refers to someone's heart. Alternatively, "sweet" is five letters, but "sweetheart" combines both. Maybe "sweet" is part of it. But the clue is "sweetheart", so maybe the word is a combination or a synonym.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of common five-letter words associated with sweetheart. Words like "lover", "belly", "kissy", "cupid" (but that's five letters, but is it a valid word? Cupid is a god of love, but "cupid" is a five-letter word. However, "cupid" might be a stretch. "Angel" is five letters, but not directly related. "Darling" is seven letters. "Honey" is
