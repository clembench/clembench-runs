You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: like algae",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle with the clue \"like algae\". First, I need to understand what the clue refers to. Algae are aquatic plants, right? So maybe the word is something that describes algae or is related to them. Alternatively, \"like algae\" could mean something that's similar in appearance or characteristics to algae.\n\nAlgae are often green, slimy, and found in water. Words that come to mind are \"green\", \"slimy\", \"aquatic\", \"marine\", \"plankton\", \"seaweed\", \"phytoplankton\", but those are longer than five letters. Wait, the target word is five letters. Let me think of five-letter words associated with algae.\n\nPossible candidates: \"green\" (but that's five letters, but maybe not the exact term). \"Algae\" itself is five letters, but the clue says \"like algae\", so maybe the word is something that algae are like. Alternatively, maybe a word that describes algae's properties. Words like \"slick\" (as in slimy), \"mossy\", but those might not fit. Let's think of common five-letter words related to algae.\n\nAnother angle: maybe a word that's a synonym for algae. But algae is a specific group. Alternatively, think of words that algae are known for. For example, algae produce oxygen, but that's not a word. Maybe \"blooms\" but that's five letters. Wait",
