	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: waffle topping

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "waffle topping". The target is a five-letter word. First, I need to think about common waffle toppings. Common ones include syrup, chocolate, whipped cream, berries, nuts, caramel, etc. But these are longer than five letters. Maybe I should think of specific toppings that are single words with five letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "syrup" is five letters. But is that a topping? Maybe. Or "choco" is too short. "Whipped cream" is two words, but maybe "whip" is part of it? Not sure. Let's think of other possibilities. "Maple" is a syrup, five letters. "Cocoa" is a powder, maybe used as a topping. "Berry" is five letters but plural. "Nutty" is five letters but not a specific topping. "Butter" is a common topping, five letters. "Jammy" is five letters but maybe not a topping. "Cream" is five letters but part of whipped cream. "Glaze" is five letters. "Frost" is five letters. "Sprinkles" is too long. "Marshmallow" is too long. "Powder" is too long. "Sticky" is five letters but maybe not a topping. "Caramel" is too long. "Nutmeg" is too long. "Vanilla" is too long. "
