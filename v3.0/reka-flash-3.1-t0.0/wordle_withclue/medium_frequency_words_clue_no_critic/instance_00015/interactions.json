You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: passenger ship",

          "content": "<reasoning>\nLet's tackle this Wordle with the clue \"passenger ship\". First, I need to think of words related to passenger ships. Passenger ships are large vessels that carry people across water, like cruise ships, ferries, or liners. Maybe the word is a type of ship or a term associated with them.\n\nThe target is a five-letter word. Let's brainstorm possible five-letter terms. Words like \"liner\" (5 letters), \"ferry\", \"cruise\", \"steam\", \"sailor\", \"voyage\" (too long), \"deck\", \"hull\", \"mast\", \"anchor\", \"berth\", \"cargo\" (too long), \"pilot\", \"tugboat\" (too long). Wait, \"liner\" is 5 letters. Let me check if \"liner\" is a valid word. Yes, it's a type of ship. But does it fit the clue? A passenger liner is a ship designed for transporting passengers. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, \"ferry\" is a five-letter word. A ferry is a passenger ship that crosses a body of water. That's also a good candidate. Let's compare. \"Liner\" vs. \"ferry\". Both are five letters. Which is more likely? Maybe \"liner\" is more specific to passenger ships. But \"ferry\" is also correct. Let's think of other possibilities. \"Sailor\" is five letters but refers to",
