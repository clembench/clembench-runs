A baby conveyance could be something like a stroller, a pram, a carriage, or maybe even a baby carrier. Since the target is a five-letter word, I need to think of five-letter words related to baby transport.\n\nLet me brainstorm possible words. Stroller is too long (7 letters), pram is 4 letters. Carriage is 9 letters. Maybe \"cot\" but that's a crib, not a conveyance. Wait, \"stroller\" is 7 letters, but maybe a shorter form? Or maybe \"wagon\"? No, that's 6 letters. Wait, \"crib\" is a baby bed, not a conveyance. Hmm.\n\nWait, \"stroller\" is 7 letters. Maybe \"strol\" is part of it, but that's not a word. Alternatively, \"pram\" is a common term for a baby carriage. But \"pram\" is four letters. The target is five letters. Maybe \"prams\" but that's plural and has an's'. Not sure. Alternatively, \"stroller\" is too long. Let me think of other baby conveyances. Maybe \"buggy\"? That's five letters. A stroller is sometimes called a buggy. So \"buggy\" is a possible candidate. Let me check if \"buggy",
