	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: baby conveyance

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "baby conveyance." First, I need to understand what the clue means. A baby conveyance could be something like a stroller, a pram, a carriage, or maybe even a baby carrier. Since the target is a five-letter word, I need to think of five-letter words related to baby transport.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let me brainstorm possible words. Stroller is too long (7 letters), pram is 4 letters. Carriage is 9 letters. Maybe "cot" but that's a crib, not a conveyance. Wait, "stroller" is 7 letters, but maybe a shorter form? Or maybe "wagon"? No, that's 6 letters. Wait, "crib" is a baby bed, not a conveyance. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "stroller" is 7 letters. Maybe "strol" is part of it, but that's not a word. Alternatively, "pram" is a common term for a baby carriage. But "pram" is four letters. The target is five letters. Maybe "prams" but that's plural and has an's'. Not sure. Alternatively, "stroller" is too long. Let me think of other baby conveyances. Maybe "buggy"? That's five letters. A stroller is sometimes called a buggy. So "buggy" is a possible candidate. Let me check if "buggy
