	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: pilsner

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "pilsner". First, I need to understand what "pilsner" refers to. Pilsner is a type of beer, right? Specifically, the Pilsner Urquell is a famous beer from the Czech Republic. The clue might be hinting at something related to beer, but since the target word is five letters, maybe a part of the beer name or related term.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "pilsner" itself is seven letters. The target is five letters. Maybe the clue is a play on words. Let me think. Pilsner could relate to "pils" or "lager", but those are longer. Alternatively, maybe the clue is a hint towards a different meaning. For example, "pilsner" might be associated with a specific color, like pale gold, but that's a stretch.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, maybe the clue is a riddle. "Pilsner" could be split into "pils" and "ner", but "ner" is part of "nerd". Not sure. Let me think of five-letter words related to pilsner. Maybe "pint"? No, that's four letters. "Brew"? Also four. "Hops"? Three. "Malt"? Four. "Yeast"? Five letters. Yeast is part of beer making. Could that be it? But why "pilsner" as the clue?
