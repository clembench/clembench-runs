The target word is a five-letter English word. First, I need to understand what \"make current\" means. \"Make current\" could refer to something that becomes standard or widely adopted. Alternatively, it might be a play on words. Let me think of possible phrases or words related to that.\n\n\"Make current\" might be a compound word. Maybe \"make\" and \"current\" combined? But combining them directly doesn't give a five-letter word. Let's break it down. \"Current\" is a five-letter word itself (c-u-r-r-e-n-t), but the clue is \"make current\". Maybe \"make\" is part of the word. Words that start with \"make\" but are five letters? \"Make\" is four letters, so maybe \"makes\"? No, that's five letters but \"makes\" is a verb. Wait, the target is five letters. Let's think of words that relate to making something current.\n\nAlternatively, \"make current\" could be a term in electricity, like a circuit that's live. But how does that translate to a five-letter word? Maybe \"live\"? But \"live\" is four letters. Wait, maybe \"live\" is part of it. Or \"flow\"? Not sure. Let's think of other angles.\n\nAnother approach: \"make current\" as in to establish as the standard. So words that mean standard or common.",
