	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: court activity

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "court activity." First, I need to understand what "court activity" refers to. A court is a place where judges and lawyers are, so maybe something related to legal proceedings. But "activity" could be a specific action that happens in a court.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "court activity" might be a term I'm not familiar with. Let me think. Maybe it's a game or a sport? Like tennis is played on a court, but that's more of a sport. Or maybe a court dance? Waltz? No, that's not five letters. Wait, the answer has to be a five-letter word.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, "court activity" could be a legal term. Maybe "proceeding" but that's too long. "Hearing" is five letters. Let me check: H-E-A-R-I-N-G. No, that's seven letters. "Trial" is five letters. T-R-I-A-L. But does "trial" relate to court activity? Yes, a trial is a court activity. But is "trial" a valid Wordle word? I think so. Let me see if there are other possibilities.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "court" as in the royal court, but that's more historical. Maybe "activity" in the royal court? Like "ceremony"? No, that's eight letters. "Gathering"? Too long. Wait, maybe "debate"? No
