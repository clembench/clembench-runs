	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: tithing

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle with the clue "tithing". First, I need to understand what "tithing" means. Tithing is when someone gives a tenth of their income to a religious organization. The word itself is five letters? No, "tithing" is seven letters. Maybe the clue is a hint towards a related five-letter word. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt The clue is "tithing", so maybe the target word is a synonym or related term. Words like "offer", "donate", "give", "alms", "charity"? But those might not be five letters. Wait, "tithing" has the letters T, I, T, H, I, N, G. Maybe the target word uses some of these letters. Let's see. The target is a five-letter word. Let's look for possible five-letter words related to tithing. Maybe "tithe" itself? But "tithe" is five letters. Wait, "tithe" is the act of tithing. So maybe the answer is "tithe"? Let me check if "tithe" is a valid Wordle word. Yes, "tithe" is a five-letter word. But does that fit the clue? The clue is "tithing", so "tithe" is a part of that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "tithi" but that's not an
