	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: steinbrenner, to the yankees

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this Wordle. The clue is "steinbrenner, to the yankees". First, I need to figure out what that refers to. Steinbrenner sounds like a last name. I remember that the New York Yankees are a famous baseball team. Maybe Steinbrenner is a former owner or a notable figure associated with them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, George Steinbrenner was the owner of the Yankees for a long time. He was known as "The Boss" and had a significant impact on the team. So the clue is probably pointing towards George Steinbrenner and the Yankees. Now, the target word is a five-letter English word. Let's think about possible connections.\\ \tt \\ \tt Steinbrenner... Maybe the last name has parts that can form a word. Let's break it down: Steinbrenner. The first part is "Stein", which is German for "stone". But that's four letters. The last part is "Brenner", which might not help. Alternatively, maybe "Brenner" is a name, but not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other connections. The Yankees are a team, so maybe a term related to baseball. Words like "ball", "bat", "pitch", "home", "run", "base", "field", "cap", "glove", "score". But how does Steinbrenner tie in?\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe "Steinbrenner
