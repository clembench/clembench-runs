You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.",

Usually, starting with a common word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants is a good idea. Words like \"apple\" or \"crane\" are often recommended because they cover a broad range of letters.\n\nWait, but maybe \"raise\" is a better starting point. It has two vowels (a and e) and three consonants (r, s, z). The letters are spread out, which might help in getting feedback. Alternatively, \"soare\" is another common starting word. Let me check which one is more common. \"raise\" is a good candidate because it's a real word and has letters that are often in the word.\n\nAlternatively, \"trace\" is another option. Hmm. Let me think. The key is to pick a word that has letters that are likely to be in the target word. High-frequency letters like E, A, R, T, O, S, etc. So \"raise\" includes R, A, I, S, E. Those are all high-frequency letters. That might be a solid first guess.\n\nWait, but maybe \"crane\" is better. Let's see. \"Crane\" has C, R, A, N, E. Also good letters. But maybe \"raise\" is more common. Let me check. I think \"raise\" is a valid starting word. Let",
