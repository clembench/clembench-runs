Let's think about the best strategy. Usually, starting with a common word that has a good mix of vowels and consonants is a good idea. Words like \"apple\" or \"crane\" are often recommended because they cover a broad range of letters.\n\nWait, but maybe \"raise\" is a better starting point. It has two vowels (a and e) and three consonants (r, s, z). The letters are spread out, which might help in getting feedback. Alternatively, \"soare\" is another common starting word. Let me check which one is more common. \"raise\" is a good candidate because it's a real word and has letters that are often in the word.\n\nAlternatively, \"trace\" is another option. Hmm. Let me think. The key is to pick a word that has letters that are likely to be in the target word. High-frequency letters like E, A, R, T, O, S, etc. So \"raise\" includes R, A, I, S, E. Those are all high-frequency letters. That might be a solid first guess.\n\nWait, but maybe \"crane\" is better. Let's see. \"Crane\" has C, R, A, N, E. Also good letters. But maybe \"raise\" is more common. Let me check. I think \"raise\" is a valid starting word. Let",
