It's the opposite of \"most,\" right? So maybe I can use that opposite relationship but not directly say \"most.\" The related words include \"most,\" so I can't use that either.\n\nHmm, \"least\" often refers to the smallest quantity or degree. So maybe something like \"opposite of most\" but since \"most\" is a related word, I can't use that. Wait, the rules say I can't use the target word or related words. So \"most\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. So I need another way to express the opposite without using those words.\n\nAlternatively, think of synonyms for \"least.\" Words like \"smallest,\" \"minimum,\" \"fewest.\" But \"smallest\" is a morphological variant of \"small,\" which isn't the target word, but maybe it's too close? The rules say morphological variants are not allowed. So \"smallest\" is derived from \"small,\" which is different from \"least,\" but maybe it's too related. The user might consider that as violating rule (b). So better avoid that.\n\nAnother angle: \"least\" can be used in phrases like \"least expected\" or \"least amount.\" But \"amount\" is a related",
