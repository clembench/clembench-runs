Maybe something about her role or appearance? But I have to be careful not to use related terms.\n\nHmm, \"woman\" is an adult human female. But I can't use \"female.\" Maybe focus on societal roles? Like someone who is a mother, wife, or works in certain professions. But that might be too vague. Alternatively, think about clothing or accessories. Wait, but the clue has to be general enough.\n\nWait, maybe use a metaphor or a common phrase. Like \"has a crown but not on her head\" – that refers to a queen, but maybe not specific enough. Or \"someone who carries the future in her hands\" – that's a bit abstract. Maybe something about age? But \"woman\" is an adult, but \"adult\" is related to \"female.\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about opposites. \"Not a child, not a man.\" But \"child\" is okay? The rules say not to use parts or morphological variants. \"Child\" is a different word, so maybe that's allowed. But maybe too obvious. Let me check the rules again. The related words are female, girl, lady. So \"child\" isn't related, so that's okay. But maybe the clue is too straightforward",
