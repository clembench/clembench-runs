A field is an open piece of land, usually used for agriculture. But I can't mention farm. Maybe focus on the activities associated with fields. Like planting crops, maybe? But \"crops\" might be related to farming. Alternatively, think about the environment. Fields are often green, but grass is a related word, so I can't use that either. Maybe something about the shape? Fields are usually flat or have gentle slopes. Or maybe the purpose. People play sports in fields, like soccer or baseball. But \"sports\" might be too vague. Or maybe the animals that graze in fields, like cows or sheep. But \"livestock\" is a related term? Not sure. Alternatively, think of the horizon. Fields extend towards the horizon. Or maybe the texture, like rough or smooth. Wait, the clue needs to be a single word or short phrase. Let me check the rules again. The clue should be in the form CLUE: <some text>. The other player will guess starting with GUESS. So the clue has to be a hint that's not using the forbidden words. Let me brainstorm. \"Where crops grow\" but \"crops\" might be okay? Wait, the related words are farm, grass, area",
