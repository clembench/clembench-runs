Finance is about managing money, dealing with budgets, investments, banking, maybe even economics. But I can't use \"money\" directly.\n\nHmm, maybe focus on the broader concept. Finance involves planning, managing, and allocating resources. But \"resources\" is also a related word I can't use. So I need another angle. What are some synonyms or related terms? Budgeting, investing, financial institutions, assets, liabilities. But again, can't use parts of the target word. \"Finance\" comes from Latin \"finire,\" meaning to end or to complete, but that's probably too obscure.\n\nWait, maybe think about the functions. Finance helps in making decisions about spending, saving, investing. Or maybe the study of financial systems. Alternatively, think of professions related to finance: accountants, bankers, economists. But the clue should be a noun or a phrase that hints at the concept.\n\nAnother approach: finance is about the flow of money in an economy. But \"money\" is off-limits. Maybe \"capital markets\"? But that's too specific. \"Financial planning\"? Again, uses parts. \"Economic systems\"? Maybe, but not sure. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or related",
