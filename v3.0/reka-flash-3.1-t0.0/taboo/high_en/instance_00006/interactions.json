Let me think about what \"reach\" means. It's about getting something or someone to a place, maybe physically or metaphorically. Like reaching for a high object, or reaching out to help someone.\n\nBut I can't use those related words. So maybe focus on the action. Words like \"grab,\" \"pull,\" \"claw,\" but those might be too specific. Wait, the clue has to be a short description. Maybe something about the end point? Like \"the action of getting something far away.\" But \"far away\" might relate to distance, which is a related word. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the verb in a different context. \"Reach\" can also mean to attain a certain level, like reaching a goal. So maybe \"attain a goal\" but that's still related. Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. \"Reach\" and \"reaching\" are okay as long as I don't use the exact word. But maybe \"attain\" is too close. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule (b) says I can't use parts or morphological variants. So \"reaching\" is a form of \"reach,\" so that's not allowed. So I need to avoid that. Maybe use synonyms that aren't related. Like",
