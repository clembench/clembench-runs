	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "reach" without using "reach" itself or any related words like stretch, extend, or distance. Let me think about what "reach" means. It's about getting something or someone to a place, maybe physically or metaphorically. Like reaching for a high object, or reaching out to help someone.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I can't use those related words. So maybe focus on the action. Words like "grab," "pull," "claw," but those might be too specific. Wait, the clue has to be a short description. Maybe something about the end point? Like "the action of getting something far away." But "far away" might relate to distance, which is a related word. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the verb in a different context. "Reach" can also mean to attain a certain level, like reaching a goal. So maybe "attain a goal" but that's still related. Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. "Reach" and "reaching" are okay as long as I don't use the exact word. But maybe "attain" is too close. Let me check the rules again.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rule (b) says I can't use parts or morphological variants. So "reaching" is a form of "reach," so that's not allowed. So I need to avoid that. Maybe use synonyms that aren't related. Like
