Also, I can't use parts or morphological variants of \"western.\"\n\nFirst, think about what \"western\" typically refers to. It's a genre of movies, literature, or music set in the American Old West, involving cowboys, outlaws, etc. But since I can't use \"cowboy\" or \"movie,\" I need to avoid those terms. Maybe focus on other aspects. The Old West is a time period, so maybe something about the setting. Think of synonyms or related concepts. \"Frontier\" comes to mind, but is that too close? Maybe not. \"Desert\" or \"prairie\"? But those are part of the setting but not sure if they're allowed. Wait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. \"Western\" comes from \"west,\" so \"west\" is a part. So I can't use \"west\" either. Hmm, tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: think of elements associated with Westerns. Guns, hats, spurs, horses, saloons, stagecoaches, bonfires, maybe hats with wide brims. But again, need to be careful. \"Horseback riding\" is a common element. But \"horse\" is allowed? The related words are eastern, cowboy",
