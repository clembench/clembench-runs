	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt late\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - slow\\ \tt - delay\\ \tt - early\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "late" without using any of the related words: slow, delay, early. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "late" means occurring after the expected or proper time. So maybe something related to time. But I can't use "delay" or "slow". How else can I describe it? Maybe using synonyms or related concepts. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "late" can also refer to death, like someone who has passed away. But the related words don't include that, but maybe it's allowed? The rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants. "Late" itself is the target, so I can't use that. But "late" as in deceased? Maybe that's a stretch. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or parts of it. "Late" is the target, so using "late" in any form is off-limits. But maybe using "deceased" is okay? Wait, the related words are slow, delay, early. So "deceased" isn't a related word, but the clue can't use the target word. So "late" as in deceased is allowed as long as I don't use the word "late". Hmm, maybe that's a possible angle. But I need to make sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other meanings. "Late" can be part of phrases like "
