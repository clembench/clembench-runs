Let me think.\n\nFirst, \"late\" means occurring after the expected or proper time. So maybe something related to time. But I can't use \"delay\" or \"slow\". How else can I describe it? Maybe using synonyms or related concepts. \n\nWait, \"late\" can also refer to death, like someone who has passed away. But the related words don't include that, but maybe it's allowed? The rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants. \"Late\" itself is the target, so I can't use that. But \"late\" as in deceased? Maybe that's a stretch. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or parts of it. \"Late\" is the target, so using \"late\" in any form is off-limits. But maybe using \"deceased\" is okay? Wait, the related words are slow, delay, early. So \"deceased\" isn't a related word, but the clue can't use the target word. So \"late\" as in deceased is allowed as long as I don't use the word \"late\". Hmm, maybe that's a possible angle. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of other meanings. \"Late\" can be part of phrases like \"",
