	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "tea" without using "tea" itself or any related words like coffee, caffeine, or brew. Let's start by thinking about what tea is. Tea is a hot drink made from leaves, usually from the Camellia sinensis plant. But I can't mention the plant name either. Maybe think about how it's prepared? Steeped leaves in hot water. But "steeped" might be too close to brewing, which is a related word. So maybe avoid that.\\ \tt \\ \tt What are the characteristics of tea? It's a beverage, often served hot, sometimes with milk or sugar. But those are common with coffee too. Maybe the cultural aspects? Like in the UK, they have tea time. But "tea time" might be too specific and could imply the word itself. Also, maybe the number of leaves? Like green tea vs black tea, but again, that's part of the word's variants.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. So "green tea" is out because "tea" is part of it. Same with "black tea". So I need to avoid that. Maybe think of other attributes. Tea is often associated with relaxation, maybe after meals. Or maybe the fact that it's a hot drink that's not coffee. But how to differentiate without using related words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the process: you boil water, add
