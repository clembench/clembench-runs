	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "respect" without using the word itself or any related words like consideration, deference, or regard. Let me think about what "respect" means. It's about having regard for someone's feelings, opinions, or rights. Maybe I can use synonyms or related concepts.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. So words like "respectful" or "disrespect" are out. Also, related words like consideration are off-limits. So I need to find another angle.\\ \tt \\ \tt What actions or situations involve respect? Maybe bowing, giving credit, acknowledging someone. But how to phrase that without using the target word. Let's see. Maybe "treat others as equals" but that's a bit vague. Or "acknowledging someone's worth without bias." Hmm, but "worth" might be related. Maybe "showing admiration for someone's achievements without knowing them." Wait, that's too long.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of objects associated with respect. Like a handshake, a salute, a nod. But how to describe that. Maybe "a gesture that shows acknowledgment without words." But "acknowledgment" might be too close to regard. Not sure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another approach: think of the opposite. Disrespect is ignoring someone, so respect is the opposite. But how to phrase that. Maybe "the opposite of ignoring someone's presence." But "ignoring" is allowed?
