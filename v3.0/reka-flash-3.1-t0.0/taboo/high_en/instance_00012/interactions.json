Wings are part of birds, right? But I can't mention bird. So maybe focus on other animals? Like bats have wings, but bat is a related word? The related words given are feather, fly, bird. So bat isn't listed, so maybe it's allowed. But maybe the user wants to avoid that. Alternatively, think about the function of a wing. It's used for flying. But \"fly\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. So maybe describe something else about wings. Structure-wise, wings have bones, like the humerus or something, but that's too technical. Maybe think about how wings are shaped. They're curved, like a curveball? Wait, curveball is a baseball term. Maybe not. Or maybe something like \"allows gliding.\" But \"glide\" is related to flying. Alternatively, think about the parts. Wings have feathers, but \"feather\" is a related word. So can't use that. Maybe think about the opposite of a wing. Like, if you have a wing, you have a body part that's opposite to a leg? No, that's not right. Maybe think about something that's used for support or movement in a different context",
