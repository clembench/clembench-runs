It's someone who watches over something or someone to prevent harm. Maybe a job title? Like a guard at a prison or a museum. Or maybe a protective role in sports, like a guard in basketball.\n\nWait, the related words are security, protect, defend. So I can't use those either. So I need to find synonyms or related concepts that aren't in the restricted list. Maybe \"watchdog\"? But \"watchdog\" might be too close. Or \"sentinel\"? That's a bit old-fashioned but not a morphological variant. Let me check if \"sentinel\" is related enough. It's a person who stands guard, so maybe that's okay. But the clue has to be a short description. How about \"Watches over a facility\"? But \"watches over\" might imply \"protect\" indirectly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of objects associated with guarding. Like a guardrail, but that's a part. Maybe a badge? Police officers have badges, but guards might too. Not sure. Or a tower with a lookout? Maybe \"Tower lookout\"? But \"lookout\" is related to watching. Maybe \"Keeps an eye on a place\"? But \"keeps an eye on\" is similar to protect. Need",
