	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "guard" without using the word itself, "security," "protect," or "defend." Let me think about what "guard" means. It's someone who watches over something or someone to prevent harm. Maybe a job title? Like a guard at a prison or a museum. Or maybe a protective role in sports, like a guard in basketball.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words are security, protect, defend. So I can't use those either. So I need to find synonyms or related concepts that aren't in the restricted list. Maybe "watchdog"? But "watchdog" might be too close. Or "sentinel"? That's a bit old-fashioned but not a morphological variant. Let me check if "sentinel" is related enough. It's a person who stands guard, so maybe that's okay. But the clue has to be a short description. How about "Watches over a facility"? But "watches over" might imply "protect" indirectly. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of objects associated with guarding. Like a guardrail, but that's a part. Maybe a badge? Police officers have badges, but guards might too. Not sure. Or a tower with a lookout? Maybe "Tower lookout"? But "lookout" is related to watching. Maybe "Keeps an eye on a place"? But "keeps an eye on" is similar to protect. Need
