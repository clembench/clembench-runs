	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt faq\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - list\\ \tt - question\\ \tt - answer\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt Let's tackle this. The target word is "faq". The related words are list, question, answer. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their parts.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "faq" stands for Frequently Asked Questions. But I can't use "question" or "answer" in the clue. So maybe focus on the structure. FAQs are usually organized in a list format. But "list" is a related word too. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe think of other aspects. FAQs are sections on websites where common issues are addressed. But how to describe that without using the forbidden words. Maybe "commonly asked section" but "asked" relates to question. Not good.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the format: questions followed by answers. But again, can't use question or answer. Maybe "collection of answers to common issues" but "collection" might be okay. Wait, "collection" isn't a related word. Let me check the related words again: list, question, answer. So "collection" is allowed. But maybe "collection of answers" is too close to answer. Hmm.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue has to avoid using the target word (faq), its parts (like frequently, asked, questions), or the related words (list, question, answer). So maybe think of synonyms or other associations. FAQs are often found in help sections, knowledge bases. But "help" isn't a related word
