The target word is \"faq\". The related words are list, question, answer. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their parts.\n\nFirst, \"faq\" stands for Frequently Asked Questions. But I can't use \"question\" or \"answer\" in the clue. So maybe focus on the structure. FAQs are usually organized in a list format. But \"list\" is a related word too. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe think of other aspects. FAQs are sections on websites where common issues are addressed. But how to describe that without using the forbidden words. Maybe \"commonly asked section\" but \"asked\" relates to question. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, think of the format: questions followed by answers. But again, can't use question or answer. Maybe \"collection of answers to common issues\" but \"collection\" might be okay. Wait, \"collection\" isn't a related word. Let me check the related words again: list, question, answer. So \"collection\" is allowed. But maybe \"collection of answers\" is too close to answer. Hmm.\n\nWait, the clue has to avoid using the target word (faq), its parts (like frequently, asked, questions), or the related words (list, question, answer). So maybe think of synonyms or other associations. FAQs are often found in help sections, knowledge bases. But \"help\" isn't a related word",
