Let's start by thinking about what a band is. A band is a group of people who play music together, right? But I can't use \"group\" or \"music.\" So maybe focus on other aspects.\n\nWait, a band can also refer to a strip of material, like a rubber band or a watch band. But the target here is probably the musical group. But maybe the clue can be ambiguous enough to cover both? Let me check the related words again. The related words are music, loop, group. So I can't use those. So I need to think of other attributes.\n\nA band might have members who each play different instruments. But how to describe that without mentioning music? Maybe \"multiple roles working together in a circle.\" Wait, \"circle\" might not be related. Or \"united in a formation.\" Hmm. Or think about the shape. A band is often circular, like a wristband. But maybe that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think of something that binds things together. Like a bandage, but that's a different type of band. Wait, but the target is \"band\" as a group. Maybe use a metaphor. Like \"a team that travels together\" but \"team\" is related to group. Can't use that.",
