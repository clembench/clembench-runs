	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "protect" without using any of the related words: guard, safe, defend. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the clue has to be something that relates to protecting but without using the target word or the related ones. Maybe think of synonyms or actions associated with protection. Words like shield, shield someone, barrier, cover, etc. But I can't use "shield" directly either? Wait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. So "shield" is okay as long as it's not a morphological variant. Wait, "protect" and "shield" are different roots, so maybe that's allowed. Let me check the rules again. Rule (b) says you can't use the target word itself, parts, or morphological variants. So "protect" is the target. Morphological variants would be words formed by adding prefixes or suffixes, like "protected" or "protection". So "shield" is a different root, so that's okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the action of protecting. Maybe something like "shielding someone from harm" but that uses "shielding". Wait, but maybe a more concise clue. Let's think of objects that protect. Like a helmet protects your head. But the clue should be general. Maybe "something that shields from danger". But "shields" is a related term? Wait, "shield" is a different
