Let me think about what \"just\" means. It can mean fair, righteous, or happening at the exact moment. But I can't use \"fair\" because it's a related word. So maybe focus on the other meanings.\n\nHmm, \"just\" can also mean recently or exactly at a point in time. Like \"the meeting starts just now.\" But how to describe that without using the word itself. Maybe something about timing or punctuality. Wait, but \"punctual\" is a morphological variant? Not sure. Maybe use a synonym that's not related. Like \"exact timing\" or \"precise moment.\" But the clue has to be a single word or short phrase. Maybe \"precisely now\" but that's two words. Or \"exact time.\" Wait, but the clue is supposed to be a clue, not the answer. Let me think of a different angle.\n\nAnother meaning of \"just\" is \"merely\" or \"only.\" Like \"I just ate a cookie.\" But again, avoiding related words. Maybe \"only\" is too close. Alternatively, think of a common phrase. \"Just because\" but that's a phrase. Maybe \"fairness\" but that's related. Wait, the related words are barely, fair, equitable. So I can't",
