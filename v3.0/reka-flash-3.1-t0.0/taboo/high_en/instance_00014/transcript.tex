	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "just" without using any parts of it or related words like barely, fair, or equitable. Let me think about what "just" means. It can mean fair, righteous, or happening at the exact moment. But I can't use "fair" because it's a related word. So maybe focus on the other meanings.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, "just" can also mean recently or exactly at a point in time. Like "the meeting starts just now." But how to describe that without using the word itself. Maybe something about timing or punctuality. Wait, but "punctual" is a morphological variant? Not sure. Maybe use a synonym that's not related. Like "exact timing" or "precise moment." But the clue has to be a single word or short phrase. Maybe "precisely now" but that's two words. Or "exact time." Wait, but the clue is supposed to be a clue, not the answer. Let me think of a different angle.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another meaning of "just" is "merely" or "only." Like "I just ate a cookie." But again, avoiding related words. Maybe "only" is too close. Alternatively, think of a common phrase. "Just because" but that's a phrase. Maybe "fairness" but that's related. Wait, the related words are barely, fair, equitable. So I can't
