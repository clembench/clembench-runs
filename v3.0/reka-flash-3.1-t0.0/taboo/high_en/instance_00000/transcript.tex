	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "away" without using any of the related words: gone, distance, here. Let me start by thinking about what "away" means. It's a preposition, adverb, adjective. It can mean not present, at a place that's not where you are, or separated in time.\\ \tt \\ \tt The rules say I can't use the target word itself or parts of it, or the related words. So I can't say "not here" because "here" is a related word. Also, "gone" is related, so I can't use that. "Distance" is another related word, so I can't mention that either.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe think of synonyms or related concepts. "Away" can mean leaving, departing, or being separated. Maybe something like "leaving" but that's a morphological variant? Wait, "leaving" is from "leave," which is a different root. Maybe that's okay. Or "departing." But maybe too similar. Alternatively, think of actions that involve moving away. Like "running away" but that uses "away." Wait, the clue can't have "away" in it. So I need to describe the concept without using the word.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "away" can be used in phrases like "out of sight," "not present," "far from here." But "here" is a related word. So maybe "
