The target word is \"pricing,\" and the related words are evaluation, cost, and value. I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words, including parts or morphological variants.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"pricing\" means. It's the process of setting the price for a product or service. So maybe something related to how much something is sold for. But I can't use \"cost\" or \"value\" directly. Evaluation is also off-limits. \n\nWait, maybe use synonyms or related concepts. Like, \"determining the amount charged for goods or services.\" But that's too direct. Let me think of a metaphor or a different angle. Maybe something like \"setting the price tag\" but \"tag\" might be too close. Or \"how much you pay for something.\" But \"pay\" is related to cost. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the action involved. \"Deciding the monetary value before sale.\" But \"monetary value\" might be too close to \"value.\" Maybe \"number on the product before you buy.\" That's more about the price tag. Or \"the act of assigning a cost to something.\" But \"cost\" is a related word. Can't use that.\n\nWait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. So \"price\" is part of \"pricing,\" so I can't use \"price\" either. So",
