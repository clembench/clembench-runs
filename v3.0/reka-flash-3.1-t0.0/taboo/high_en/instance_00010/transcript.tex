	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "attack" without using any of the related words: war, fight, strike. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, the clue has to be something that's associated with an attack but not directly using the word. Maybe think about the action involved. An attack often involves force, maybe something like a sudden movement. Words like "sudden force" or "aggressive movement" come to mind. But I need to make sure I'm not using any related terms. Wait, "sudden force" might be okay. Let me check the related words again: war, fight, strike. None of those are in "sudden force." \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the effect of an attack. Maybe something like "sudden aggression" but "aggression" might be too close. Or maybe "surprise movement." Hmm. Another angle: in games or contexts, an attack might be represented by a symbol, like a lightning bolt (for speed) or a sword (for combat). But the clue has to be text. Maybe "lightning speed followed by force." Wait, but "force" is part of the attack. Maybe "sudden strike" but "strike" is a related word. Can't use that. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words are war, fight, strike. So I can't use those. So "strike" is out. Maybe "charge" or "rush"? But "charge
