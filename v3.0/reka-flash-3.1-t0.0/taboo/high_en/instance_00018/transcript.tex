	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "must" without using "must" itself or any related words like "should," "essential," or "have." Let me think about what "must" means. It's a modal verb indicating necessity or obligation. So maybe something that's required or unavoidable.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, synonyms could be "required," "necessary," "obligatory." But I can't use those directly. Maybe think of situations where something must be done. Like, "You can't avoid it" or "No choice." Wait, but "can't avoid" might imply necessity. Alternatively, think of a common phrase or expression. "Must" is often used in contexts like "You must go," "It must be true." Maybe something related to certainty? But "must" can also mean obligation. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the clue needs to be a single word or short phrase. Let me think of objects or concepts that represent necessity. Maybe a key? Like "key to success" but that's too vague. Or a rule? "Rule of thumb"? Not sure. Alternatively, think of something that's essential. The related words include "essential," so I can't use that. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about "obligation"? But that's a synonym. Maybe a metaphor. Like "anchor" because it's something that holds you down, but that's more about being stuck. Or "compulsion." Hmm. Alternatively, think of
