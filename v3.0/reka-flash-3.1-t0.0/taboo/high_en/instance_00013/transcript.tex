	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "marine" without using the word itself or any related words like aquatic, nautical, or oceangoing. Let me think about what "marine" typically refers to. It's related to the sea, oceans, or saltwater environments. So maybe something about creatures that live in the sea, or activities associated with the ocean.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I can't use "aquatic" because that's a related word. So maybe avoid terms like fish, sea creatures, or boats. Wait, "nautical" is also a related word, so things like ships or sailors might be off-limits. "Oceangoing" is another one, so maybe not mentioning ships that go to the ocean.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe focus on something else. The word "marine" can also refer to the branch of the military that deals with amphibious operations, like the Marines. But I don't know if that's too obscure or if it's allowed. The rules say I can't use morphological variants, but "Marine" as a noun (the military branch) is a different word. Wait, the target word is "marine" as an adjective, but maybe the clue can use the noun form? Let me check the rules again. Rule (a) says not to use the target word itself or parts or morphological variants. So "Marine" as the military branch is a different word, but maybe
