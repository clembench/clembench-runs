I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use any of these words or their parts.\n\nFirst, I should think about what \"den\" means. A den is a small room or shelter, often for animals. But since \"cave,\" \"nest,\" and \"lair\" are related, I can't use those. So maybe focus on the idea of a hidden place where someone lives or rests. Words like shelter, hideout, retreat come to mind. But I need to avoid using any morphological variants. For example, \"den\" is a noun, so maybe \"shelter\" is okay, but I should check if \"shelter\" is related. Wait, the related words are cave, nest, lair. Shelter might be too close to cave or lair, but maybe it's allowed. Alternatively, think of other attributes: cozy, private, animal's home. But again, can't use the target word or related ones.\n\nAnother angle: \"den\" can also refer to a room in a house, like a den in a living area. So maybe something about a room in a house that's used for relaxing. But the related words are animal-related, so maybe the clue should lean towards that. Wait, the target word \"den\" can be both animal's home and a",
