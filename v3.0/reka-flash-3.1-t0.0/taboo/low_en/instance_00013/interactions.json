Wheat is a type of cereal grain, right? But I can't use \"grain\" in the clue. So maybe focus on other characteristics.\n\nWheat is used to make bread, pasta, and other foods. But \"flour\" is a related word, so I can't mention that either. Hmm. What else? Wheat has a golden color, maybe? Or the way it growsâ€”sturdy stalks, maybe? Or the fact that it's a staple food in many cultures. Wait, but \"staple\" might be okay as long as it's not a related word. Let me check the related words again: grain, grass, flour. So \"staple\" isn't in there, so maybe that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, think about the plant itself. Wheat is a grass, but \"grass\" is a related word, so I can't use that. So maybe avoid mentioning the plant type. What about the texture? Wheat has a rough texture when harvested, but that's probably not helpful. Or maybe the fact that it's a key ingredient in baking. But again, flour is off-limits.\n\nWait, maybe think about the process. Wheat is ground into flour, but I can't say that. How about the color",
