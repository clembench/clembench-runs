	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "spoon" without using the word itself, any parts of it, or related words like eating, dinner, or bowl. Let me think about what a spoon is used for. It's a utensil for eating, but I can't mention eating. Maybe focus on its shape? A spoon has a curved handle and a flat, wide bowl. But bowl is a related word, so I can't use that either.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe think about how it's held. You hold it by the handle and use the bowl part to scoop. But again, bowl is off-limits. How about the action? Stirring, scooping, serving. But stirring might relate to eating. Hmm. Maybe the material? Silverware, metal, plastic. But that's too generic. What's unique about a spoon? It's one of the primary eating utensils, but again, eating is a related word. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the shape. A spoon is like a U-shape with a handle. Maybe compare it to something else. A spoon is like a curved metal leaf. Or maybe the way it's used in cooking, like mixing. But mixing could be part of eating. Wait, the related words are eating, dinner, bowl. So I can't use those. \\ \tt \\ \tt What about the part of the spoon? The bowl is a related word, so can't mention that. The handle is
