Let me think about what a spoon is used for. It's a utensil for eating, but I can't mention eating. Maybe focus on its shape? A spoon has a curved handle and a flat, wide bowl. But bowl is a related word, so I can't use that either.\n\nWait, maybe think about how it's held. You hold it by the handle and use the bowl part to scoop. But again, bowl is off-limits. How about the action? Stirring, scooping, serving. But stirring might relate to eating. Hmm. Maybe the material? Silverware, metal, plastic. But that's too generic. What's unique about a spoon? It's one of the primary eating utensils, but again, eating is a related word. \n\nAlternatively, think about the shape. A spoon is like a U-shape with a handle. Maybe compare it to something else. A spoon is like a curved metal leaf. Or maybe the way it's used in cooking, like mixing. But mixing could be part of eating. Wait, the related words are eating, dinner, bowl. So I can't use those. \n\nWhat about the part of the spoon? The bowl is a related word, so can't mention that. The handle is",
