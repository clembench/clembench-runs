	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "wicket" without using the word itself, any parts of it, or related words like lattice, gate, or door. Let me think about what a wicket is. In cricket, a wicket is a structure that the batsman has to defend, and it's like three stumps with bails on top. But maybe the user is thinking of a different context? There's also a wicket in a gate or fence, like a small opening. But since "gate" is a related word, I can't use that.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words are lattice, gate, door. So I can't mention those either. So I need to think of other associations. Maybe the sound? Like the sound a wicket makes when the ball hits it? Or maybe the shape? It's three vertical poles with something on top. Or maybe in terms of usage, like a wicket is something you pass through or defend. \\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of other meanings. In some contexts, a wicket is a small gate, but since gate is a related word, that's out. Maybe in bowling, a wicket is the target? Wait, in bowling, the term "wicket" isn't used. Maybe in baseball, there's a similar structure? No, baseball has bases. Maybe in American football? No. \\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, maybe the clue is about the number of parts. A
