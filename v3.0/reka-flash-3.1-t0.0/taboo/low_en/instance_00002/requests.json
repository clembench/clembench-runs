Let me think about what \"competent\" means. It means having the ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully. So maybe something about being good at something, but I can't use \"skilled\" or \"capable.\"\n\nHmm, maybe use a synonym in a different way. Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. So words like \"competence\" or \"competently\" are out. Let me think of other attributes. Competent people are reliable, maybe? Or maybe they can handle tasks well. How about something like \"adequate for the job\"? But \"adequate\" might be too vague. Or \"effective in performance\"? But \"effective\" is related to efficient, which is a related word. Wait, the related words are efficient, skilled, capable. So I can't use those either. So I need to avoid those terms.\n\nWhat else defines competent? Maybe someone who can be trusted to do a job properly. How about \"reliable and effective worker\"? Wait, \"effective\" is related to efficient, which is a related word. So that's not allowed. Maybe \"adequate performer\"? Still not sure. Let me think of a different angle. Competent people can solve problems, make decisions. Maybe \"problem-solver with good",
