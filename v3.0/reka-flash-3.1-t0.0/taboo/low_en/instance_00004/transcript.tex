	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "sacrifice" without using the word itself, "loss," "victim," or "offering." Let me think about what "sacrifice" means. It's giving up something valuable for a greater good or to achieve something else. Maybe something like giving up something you love. But I can't use "sacrifice" or the related words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, the related words are loss, victim, offering. So I can't use those either. So I need to avoid any synonyms or related terms. Let me brainstorm. Sacrifice often involves giving up something. Maybe something like "giving up something cherished for a cause." But "cherished" might be okay. Or maybe "renouncing something important." Hmm. Let me check if those words are allowed. The rules say I can't use the target word or parts of it, or the related words. So "giving up" is part of the concept but not the word itself. Maybe "giving up something you love for a higher goal." But "higher goal" might be too vague. Alternatively, think of a common phrase. Like "a gift you don't want to give." Wait, but "gift" is related to offering? Not sure. Maybe "something you give up to help others." But "help others" is okay. Let me see. The clue needs to be short. Maybe "Giving up something
