Let me think.\n\nFirst, what is a boolean? It's a data type that can be either true or false. But I can't use \"true\" or \"false\" since they're related words. So maybe I need to describe it in another way. Maybe think about what booleans are used for. They're often used in conditions, like in programming to check if something is true or false. But again, can't mention programming.\n\nWait, the related words are logic, true, programming. So I can't use those. So maybe focus on the concept of having two possible states. Like a switch that's either on or off. But \"on\" and \"off\" might not be related words. Are they considered related? The rules say I can't use related words provided, but \"on\" and \"off\" aren't listed. Maybe that's okay. Let me check the rules again. The related words are logic, true, programming. So as long as I don't use those, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, think of something that has two distinct states. Like a light switch, a yes/no answer, a binary choice. But how to phrase that without using forbidden terms. Maybe \"A type of variable with two possible states.\" But \"variable\" might be",
