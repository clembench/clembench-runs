Let me start by thinking about the meaning of \"steady.\" It means something that doesn't change, remains stable, or is reliable. Synonyms could be things like unchanging, consistent, reliable, firm (but firm is a related word, so I can't use that). Maybe think of objects or actions that are steady. Like a steady hand, steady pace, steady rain. But I can't use parts of the word. Maybe use a metaphor or a different context. How about something like \"unwavering support\"? But \"support\" might not be directly related. Or \"consistent rhythm\"? Wait, rhythm is okay. Or maybe \"never wavers.\" But \"wavers\" is the opposite. Maybe \"always on track.\" Track is okay. Or \"doesn't shake.\" Shake is a verb. Maybe \"solid foundation.\" Foundation is a noun. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or related words. So \"steady\" is the target, and the related words are constant, firm, even. So I can't use any of those. So \"solid foundation\" might work. Or \"unshakable.\" Unshakable is an adjective, but does it relate? Maybe. Alternatively, think of something that's steady in nature. Like a river's flow?",
