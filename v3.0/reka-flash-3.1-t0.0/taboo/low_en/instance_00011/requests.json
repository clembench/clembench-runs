Let me think about what a startup is. A startup is a new business or company that's just starting out, right? They're usually innovative and aim to grow quickly. But I can't use \"company\" or \"organization\" because those are related words. So maybe focus on other aspects.\n\nStartups often have a product or service that's new or disruptive. They might be tech-based, but not necessarily. Maybe something about the process? Like launching a new venture. Wait, \"venture\" is related to company? Maybe not directly. Let me check the related words again: beginning, organization, company. So \"venture\" might be okay. Alternatively, think about the people involved—entrepreneurs. But \"entrepreneur\" is a person, not sure if that's allowed. The rules say related words are the ones listed, so maybe other terms are okay as long as they're not in the list.\n\nAnother angle: startups are often associated with innovation, risk-taking, scaling up. Maybe use a metaphor. Like a rocket taking off? That's a common analogy. Rockets launch, start something new. But does \"rocket\" relate to any of the forbidden words? Probably not. So \"CLUE: Rocket taking off from Earth.\" Wait, but \"Earth\" is",
