          "content": "<reasoning>\nI need to come up with a clue for the word \"statue\" without using the word itself, \"sculpture,\" \"monument,\" or \"figure.\" Let me think about what defines a statue. A statue is a three-dimensional artwork representing a person or animal, usually in stone or metal. It's a static representation, often of someone important.\n\nSince I can't use \"sculpture,\" maybe I can focus on the materials or the purpose. Statues are often placed in public spaces, like parks or squares. They might be of historical figures, deities, or symbolic representations. But \"figure\" is a related word I can't use either. So maybe avoid terms like \"human figure\" or \"animal figure.\"\n\nAnother angle: statues are made to be viewed from all angles, not just front-facing. They can be life-sized or larger than life. Maybe mention standing still, not moving. Or maybe the act of creating them involves carving or molding. But \"sculpture\" is off-limits, so I can't use that term.\n\nWait, the clue has to be a single sentence, right? So I need something concise. Let me brainstorm some possibilities. \n\nHow about \"A silent observer in public spaces, carved to honor the past.\" That uses \"carved\" which relates to sculpture but maybe it's okay? Wait, \"sculpture\" is a related word, but the clue doesn't use the word itself",
