Let me start by thinking about what a database is. It's a collection of information that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. So maybe something about organizing data.\n\nWait, the related words are table, index, and knowledge. So I can't mention those. Let me avoid those terms. Maybe use synonyms or other concepts. A database is structured, so maybe something about structure. Or maybe think about how it's used. Like storing information, retrieving it quickly.\n\nAlternatively, think about the function. A database allows you to store, search, and retrieve data. So maybe a clue that hints at that. But how to phrase it without using forbidden words. Let's see. Maybe \"Organizes and stores information for quick access.\" But does that use any forbidden terms? \"Organizes\" is okay, \"stores\" is okay, \"information\" is allowed. \"Quick access\" is okay. Wait, but \"stores\" might be too close? The rules say you can't use morphological variants. Wait, the target word is \"database,\" so morphological variants would be words like databases, databased, etc. But \"stores\" is a different word. So maybe that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, think of a metaphor. A database is like a library for data",
