A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. So the key elements here are a woman, a deceased spouse, and the state of being left without a partner.\n\nBut I can't use \"woman,\" \"husband,\" or \"dead.\" So I need to find synonyms or related terms that aren't in the restricted list. Let's think about synonyms for woman: maybe \"female,\" but \"female\" might be too generic. \"Spouse\" is related to husband, but spouse is a broader term. Wait, spouse isn't in the related words list. Wait, the related words provided are woman, husband, dead. So spouse is allowed? Wait, the rules say that related words provided are the ones that also can't be used. So the related words are woman, husband, dead. So I can't use those. So spouse is okay? Because spouse isn't listed as a related word. Wait, the rules say: \"the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\" So the related words are woman, husband, dead. So I can't use those. So spouse is allowed? Because spouse is not in the list. Hmm. But spouse is a synonym for husband or wife. Since husband is in the related words, maybe spouse",
