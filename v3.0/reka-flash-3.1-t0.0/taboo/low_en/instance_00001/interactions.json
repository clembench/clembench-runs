Let me think.\n\nFirst, what does \"notable\" mean? It means someone or something that is well-known, recognized, or memorable. So maybe I can think of synonyms or characteristics that aren't in the related words list. Words like famous, distinguished, recognizable, well-known. But those might be too close. Wait, the related words are important, outstanding, prominent. So I can't use those. Maybe use a different angle.\n\nWhat are some examples of notable people? Like historical figures, celebrities, maybe even inanimate objects that are famous. But I can't mention the target word. Maybe use a metaphor or a common phrase. For example, \"famous for a reason\" but that uses \"famous\" which is related. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of something that stands out. Like a landmark. But \"landmark\" might be too specific. Or maybe \"recognizable face\" but that's a person. Wait, the clue has to be general enough for any notable thing. Maybe \"something everyone knows by name\" but that uses \"knows\" and \"name\" which might be okay. Wait, the rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. So \"name\" is okay as long as it's not part of the target word. Notable",
