They might be served with condiments like ketchup, mustard, relish. But the clue can't include those either. Wait, the related words are sausage, bread, frankfurter. So maybe I can't use those terms. So I need to think of other features.\n\nWhat else? They're typically eaten at baseball games, but that's a context, not a defining feature. Maybe the shape? They're long and cylindrical. But how to describe that without using related terms. Maybe \"steamed meat in a bun\" but that uses \"meat\" and \"bun\" which is related to bread. Hmm.\n\nWait, the related words are sausage, bread, frankfurter. So I can't use those. So \"sausage\" is out, \"bread\" is out, \"frankfurter\" is a type of sausage, so that's also out.
