Let me start by understanding what a stakeholder is. A stakeholder is someone who has an interest in a company or project, like employees, customers, investors, etc. They can affect or be affected by the organization's decisions.\n\nThe challenge is to describe this without using the forbidden words. Let's see. The related words are partner, share, concerned. So I can't use those. Maybe focus on the idea of someone with an interest. Words like \"interested party\" come to mind, but \"party\" might be too close. \"Beneficiary\" is a related term but maybe allowed? Wait, the rules say related words provided are partner, share, concerned. So maybe \"beneficiary\" is okay as long as it's not in the related list. Let me check the rules again. The related words are the ones listed, so I can't use those. So \"beneficiary\" might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, think of stakeholders as people affected by a project. So maybe \"affected party\" but again, \"party\" might be too similar. Maybe \"someone impacted by decisions\" but \"impacted\" is a verb. The clue needs to be a noun phrase. How about \"entity influenced by outcomes\"? That's a bit long. Maybe \"someone",
