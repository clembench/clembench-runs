Also, I can't use the related words like oddity, originality, or freshness. Let me think about what \"novelty\" means. It refers to something new, something that's not common or familiar. Maybe I can focus on the aspect of being new or unusual.\n\nWait, but \"oddity\" is a related word, so I can't use that. How about using a synonym that's not in the related list? Words like \"innovation\" or \"uniqueness\" come to mind. But \"uniqueness\" might be too close to originality, which is also a related word. Hmm. Maybe something more concrete. Novelty items are often things like trinkets or decorations. But that might be too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think about the effect of novelty. It catches attention, stands out, is unexpected. Maybe use an action related to that. Like \"something that stops you in your tracks\" or \"unexpected surprise.\" But I need to make sure I'm not using any forbidden terms. Let me check each part.\n\n\"Unexpected surprise\" – \"surprise\" isn't a related word here, right? The related words are oddity, originality, freshness. So maybe that's okay. But does \"surprise\" relate too much? Maybe",
