It's like something that appears but isn't real, a shadowy figure, maybe a presence that's felt but not seen. The related words are unreal, ghost, and apparition, so I can't use those either.\n\nHmm, maybe focus on characteristics. Phantom often has a connection to the supernatural or something unseen. Words like \"echo,\" \"shadow,\" \"presence,\" \"haunting,\" \"invisible,\" \"specter\" come to mind. But \"specter\" is similar to apparition, so maybe avoid that. Let's see. The clue needs to be short and to the point. Maybe something about being present but not visible. Like \"A presence felt but not seen.\" Wait, \"presence\" is okay? The related words are unreal, ghost, apparition. Presence isn't related, so that's safe. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or related words. So \"presence felt but not seen\" – \"presence\" is okay. Maybe that's a good clue. Alternatively, \"Echo without sound\" – phantom can sometimes be associated with echoes, like a phantom limb or phantom pain. But \"echo\" might be okay. Wait, does \"echo\" relate to any",
