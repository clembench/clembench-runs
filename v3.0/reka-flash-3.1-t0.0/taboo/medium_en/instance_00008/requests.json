Let me think about what \"demo\" means. It's short for demonstration, right? So maybe something that shows how something works. But I can't use \"demonstration\" either because that's a morphological variant.\n\nWait, the related words are rally, show, model. So I can't use those either. Let me brainstorm synonyms or related concepts. A demo is like a demonstration, so maybe something like \"public display\" but that might be too vague. Or \"example in action\"? But \"example\" might be okay. Let me check the rules again. The clue can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants, and also can't use the related words. So \"demonstration\" is out, \"show\" is a related word, so can't use that. \"Model\" is another related word, so can't use that either. \"Rally\" is a related word, so avoid that.\n\nWhat else is a demo? Maybe a trial version? Like a software demo. But \"trial\" might be okay. Or maybe \"performance\" but that's related to show. Hmm. Let me think of other contexts. A demo could be a protest demonstration, but again, \"demonstration\" is a morphological variant. Maybe \"public protest",
