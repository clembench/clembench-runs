The target word is \"murphy\". First, I need to figure out what \"murphy\" refers to. It could be a surname, but more likely, it's a brand or a product. Oh right, Murphy beds! Those are wall-mounted beds that fold down. But I have to be careful not to use the word \"bed\" directly because \"murphy\" is the brand, but maybe \"bed\" is related? The related words given are irish, potato, con. So I can't use those either.\n\nWait, the rules say I can't use the target word itself, parts, or morphological variants. So \"murphy\" is off-limits. Also, related words like irish, potato, con can't be used. So I need to describe a Murphy bed without mentioning bed, Murphy, or those related words. Let me think of synonyms or other descriptors. Maybe \"wall bed\" but \"bed\" is part of the term. Hmm. Alternatively, think of the action: folds into a cabinet, converts to a sitting area. But how to phrase that without using forbidden terms.\n\nAlternatively, think of the furniture type. Maybe \"folding wall furniture\" but that's vague. Or \"sofa bed\" but that's a different type. Wait, Murphy beds are specifically vertical folding. Maybe \"vertical folding furniture\" but again, not specific. Alternatively, think of the mechanism: it's",
