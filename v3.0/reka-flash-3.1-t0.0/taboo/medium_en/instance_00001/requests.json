The target word is \"bill\". I need to come up with a clue that doesn't use \"bill\" or any related words like pay, charge, or invoice. The clue has to be short and to the point because of the time pressure.\n\nFirst, think about what a bill is. A bill is like a piece of paper you get when you buy something, right? It lists what you bought and how much you owe. But I can't use \"invoice\" because that's a related word. So maybe focus on the action of receiving it. Wait, \"pay\" is also a related word. So I can't mention paying. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the shape. Bills are usually folded into a triangle shape. So maybe \"triangular paper you get after shopping\". But does that work? Let me check. \"Triangular paper\" – that's descriptive. But does it avoid the forbidden words? Yes. The user gets the idea that it's a paper document, triangular, received after shopping. But maybe \"shopping\" is too specific. Alternatively, \"triangular document with prices\". That might be better. Or \"folded paper listing items and amounts\". Wait, \"amounts\" is okay? The related words are pay, charge, invoice. \"Amounts\" isn't a related word. So maybe that's safe.\n\nAnother angle: Bills can also refer to political bills, like proposals. But the",
