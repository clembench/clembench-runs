Let me think about what \"violation\" means. It's when someone breaks a rule or law. So maybe something about breaking rules or laws.\n\nBut I can't use \"law\" directly? Wait, the rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants. \"Law\" isn't a morphological variant of \"violation,\" but maybe it's related. Wait, the related words given are transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So \"law\" might not be considered a related word here. But maybe I should avoid using \"law\" to be safe. Let me check the rules again. The rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants of it, and also the same rules apply to related words provided. The related words are transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So I can't use those either. So I need to avoid using those words.\n\nSo the clue has to be something that implies breaking a rule or law without using those terms. Maybe use synonyms or metaphors. For example, \"Breaking a rule\" is too direct. Maybe \"Act against regulations\" but \"regulations\" might be too close. Alternatively, think of common phrases. Like \"breaking the rules\" but again, similar. Maybe use",
