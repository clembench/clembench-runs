	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "violation" without using the word itself, any parts of it, or related words like transgression, misdemeanor, or offence. Let me think about what "violation" means. It's when someone breaks a rule or law. So maybe something about breaking rules or laws.\\ \tt \\ \tt But I can't use "law" directly? Wait, the rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants. "Law" isn't a morphological variant of "violation," but maybe it's related. Wait, the related words given are transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So "law" might not be considered a related word here. But maybe I should avoid using "law" to be safe. Let me check the rules again. The rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants of it, and also the same rules apply to related words provided. The related words are transgression, misdemeanor, offence. So I can't use those either. So I need to avoid using those words.\\ \tt \\ \tt So the clue has to be something that implies breaking a rule or law without using those terms. Maybe use synonyms or metaphors. For example, "Breaking a rule" is too direct. Maybe "Act against regulations" but "regulations" might be too close. Alternatively, think of common phrases. Like "breaking the rules" but again, similar. Maybe use
