Let me think about what a steward does. They often manage events, handle logistics, maybe serve food or drinks. But I can't use \"serve\" because \"servant\" is a related word. Maybe focus on their role in organizing or overseeing something.\n\nWait, stewardesses are flight attendants, but \"attendant\" is a related word I can't use. So maybe avoid roles related to service. Stewards in events manage seating, ensure everything runs smoothly. Maybe use a metaphor. Like a manager of a ship or event. But \"manager\" might be too vague. Alternatively, think of a person who has responsibility for a place or group. Maybe \"overseer of a vessel\" but \"vessel\" might not be specific enough. Or \"event coordinator\" but that's too direct. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: stewardship. The noun form. But the clue has to be a description, not a noun. Maybe \"handles logistics for a group\" but \"handles\" is okay? Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. \"Steward\" is the target, but \"stewardship\" is a different word. Maybe that's allowed. Let me check. The rules say parts or morphological variants. \"Stewardship\" is a different",
