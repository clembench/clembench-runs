It refers to characteristics of a population, like age, gender, race, etc. So the clue should hint at population characteristics without using those related terms.\n\nFirst, think of synonyms or related concepts. Maybe \"population data\" but that might be too close. Wait, the related words include \"statistic,\" so I can't use that. How about \"data about people's characteristics\"? But \"people\" is a related word, so I can't use that either. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the key elements. Demographics include age, gender, location, income, education. Maybe focus on one of these aspects. For example, \"Age and gender breakdown\" â€“ but \"breakdown\" might be a statistic term. Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. So \"breakdown\" is okay as long as it's not a variant of a related word. Not sure. Maybe better to avoid.\n\nAnother angle: Demographics are used to study populations. So maybe \"Study of population characteristics.\" But \"population\" is related to \"people\" and \"group,\" which are on the list. Wait, the related words are \"people,\" \"group,\" \"statistic.\" So \"population\" is allowed? The",
