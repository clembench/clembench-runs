	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "sweep" without using "sweep" itself or any related words like clean, cover, or brush. Let me think about what "sweep" means. It's like moving something across the ground, maybe with a broom, to gather dirt or debris. But I can't mention a broom. Maybe the action itself? Like a quick movement that gathers things. Or maybe something related to the sound? Like the sound of a broom sweeping. But again, broom is related to brush, which is a related word. So I can't use that.\\ \tt \\ \tt Wait, "sweep" can also mean to move something in a broad, flowing motion. Like a dancer sweeping across the floor. Or maybe in sports, like a sweep in baseball where runners move around the bases. But I'm not sure if that's the common meaning. The main meaning is probably the action of cleaning with a broom. But since I can't use "clean" or "brush," I need another angle.\\ \tt \\ \tt What else is associated with sweeping? Maybe the result, like a sweep of the floor being clean. But "clean" is a related word. Hmm. Maybe the motion? Like a quick, broad movement. Or something that covers a lot of area. Wait, "cover" is a related word too. So I can't use that either. \\ \tt \\ \tt How about using a metaphor? Like "a
