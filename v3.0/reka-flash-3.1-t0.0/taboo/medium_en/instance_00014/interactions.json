Let me think about what \"sweep\" means. It's like moving something across the ground, maybe with a broom, to gather dirt or debris. But I can't mention a broom. Maybe the action itself? Like a quick movement that gathers things. Or maybe something related to the sound? Like the sound of a broom sweeping. But again, broom is related to brush, which is a related word. So I can't use that.\n\nWait, \"sweep\" can also mean to move something in a broad, flowing motion. Like a dancer sweeping across the floor. Or maybe in sports, like a sweep in baseball where runners move around the bases. But I'm not sure if that's the common meaning. The main meaning is probably the action of cleaning with a broom. But since I can't use \"clean\" or \"brush,\" I need another angle.\n\nWhat else is associated with sweeping? Maybe the result, like a sweep of the floor being clean. But \"clean\" is a related word. Hmm. Maybe the motion? Like a quick, broad movement. Or something that covers a lot of area. Wait, \"cover\" is a related word too. So I can't use that either. \n\nHow about using a metaphor?
