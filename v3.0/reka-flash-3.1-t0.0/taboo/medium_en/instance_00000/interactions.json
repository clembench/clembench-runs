Let me start by understanding what \"declaration\" means. It's a formal statement of something, like announcing something officially. Examples include declarations of war, independence, or maybe even a declaration of rights.\n\nSince I can't use \"declaration,\" I need synonyms or related concepts. Words like statement, announcement, proclamation. But wait, \"proclamation\" might be too close. Let me check if that's a morphological variant. \"Proclaim\" is the verb, so \"proclamation\" is a noun. Maybe that's okay, but better to be safe. The rules say I can't use morphological variants, so maybe \"proclamation\" is derived from \"proclaim,\" which is a different root. Hmm, maybe it's allowed. But to be safe, maybe avoid.\n\nAnother angle: think of contexts where declarations are used. Like in legal documents, speeches, official announcements. But related words like law and resolution are already excluded. Testimony is another related word, which is a statement given under oath. So I can't mention testimony either.\n\nWhat's the core idea? A formal statement made publicly. Maybe something about announcing something important. Let's think of objects or actions associated with declarations. A scroll? Like a scroll with a written statement. Or a document. But",
