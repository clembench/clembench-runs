	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>.

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "queue" without using the word itself, "line," "row," or "chain." Let me think about what "queue" means. It's a line of people waiting, right? So maybe something about waiting in order. But I can't use "line," so I need another way to describe that.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hmm, maybe use a metaphor. Like a line of people waiting could be similar to something else. Maybe animals in a parade? Or maybe something like a line of ducks quacking in order? Wait, "quack" is part of the word "queue," but I don't think that's a morphological variant. Wait, "queue" comes from French "queue," which means tail. But maybe that's too obscure. Let me check the rules again. The rules say I can't use parts or morphological variants. So "queue" itself is off, but parts like "cue" might be okay? Wait, "cue" is a separate word, but "queue" is spelled with "cue" in it. But the rules say parts or morphological variants. So maybe "cue" is a part, but I'm not sure. The user probably wants to avoid any direct parts. Maybe better to be safe.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of the action. When you queue, you wait your turn. So maybe something about waiting in order. But how to phrase that without using "
