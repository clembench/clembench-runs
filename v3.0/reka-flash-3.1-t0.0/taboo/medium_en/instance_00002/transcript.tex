	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "prospective" without using the word itself, any parts of it, or related words like foresight, potential, or future. Let me start by understanding what "prospective" means. It refers to something that is in the future, like a future possibility or someone who is about to become something. For example, a prospective student is someone who is going to attend a school in the future.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, I can't use words like future, potential, or foresight. So I need to think of synonyms or related concepts that aren't on that list. Maybe words like upcoming, impending, or candidate? Wait, "candidate" might be okay if it's not related. Let me check the related words again. The related words given are foresight, potential, future. So "candidate" isn't listed, but I need to make sure it's not a morphological variant. "Prospective" comes from "prospect," so "candidate" is different.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think about the context where "prospective" is used. Like in "prospective buyer" or "prospective student." Maybe the clue can relate to someone considering a future role. But how to phrase that without using forbidden words.\\ \tt \\ \tt Another angle: "prospective" often refers to something that hasn't happened yet but is expected. So maybe something like "before becoming reality" but that uses "
