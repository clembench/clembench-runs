Let me think about synonyms or related concepts.\n\nSurprise often involves unexpected events, maybe something that catches you off guard. But I can't use \"unexpected\" since it's a related word. How about using an action that's associated with surprise? Like gasping, jumping, or maybe a reaction. Wait, maybe something visual. Oh, like a \"look of astonishment\" but that might be too close. Or maybe something like \"eyes wide open\" but that's still descriptive. Alternatively, think of objects that represent surprise. A \"lightbulb moment\" is about realization, not exactly surprise. Maybe a \"jaw dropping\"? That's a common expression. Let me check if \"jaw\" is allowed. The target word is \"surprise,\" so \"jaw\" isn't part of it. But \"jaw dropping\" is an idiom. Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. \"Surprise\" is the target, so \"surprised\" is a variant. But \"jaw\" is a separate word. Hmm. Maybe \"jaw dropping\" is okay. Alternatively, think of something like a \"startled expression\" but \"startled\" is related to shock, which is a related word. So I can't use that. \n\n",
