Let me think about what emphasize means. It's about making something more noticeable or important. So maybe something like \"make important\" but that's too vague. Maybe use a synonym that's not in the related words. Words like stress are already excluded. How about \"draw attention to\"? But \"draw attention\" might be too close. Maybe use an action that implies emphasis, like \"point out clearly\" but again, \"point out\" might be related. Alternatively, think of verbs that are synonyms. Words like accentuate, stress, underline—those are all related and can't be used. Maybe use a different angle. Emphasize is often done through repetition, intensity, or punctuation. For example, in writing, you might use bold or italics. But how to describe that without using related terms. Maybe \"use bold letters\" but \"bold\" isn't a related word. Wait, the related words are highlight, underscore, stress. So bold isn't related. So maybe \"use bold letters to make important\" but that's still using \"important\". Alternatively, think of the effect: making something stand out. Maybe \"make stand out\" but \"stand out\" could be a clue. Let me check if \"stand out\" is allowed. The rules say you can't",
