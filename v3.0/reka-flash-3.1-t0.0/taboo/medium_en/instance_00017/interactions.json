The clue has to be short and to the point because of the time pressure.\n\nFirst, what does \"nick\" mean? It's a small cut or scratch, right? But I can't use \"cut\" or \"dent\". So maybe think of other words that describe a small mark. Words like scratch, chip, or maybe even a slight injury. But scratch is a bit close to cut, maybe? Wait, the rules say I can't use morphological variants. So \"scratch\" is a verb, but \"nick\" is a noun. Maybe that's okay? Let me check. The rules say parts or morphological variants. \"Nick\" comes from \"nicker\", which is a variant. So scratch might be okay. But maybe safer to avoid.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sound. Like when something makes a small scraping noise? Or maybe a small mark on something, like a coin. Wait, a \"nick\" on a coin is a small mark. So maybe \"A mark on a coin that's not a dent\"? But \"dent\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: \"nick\" can also mean to steal a little, like nicking something. But the primary meaning here is the",
