Swords are typically long, pointed, and used for cutting or thrusting. They have a hilt and a crossguard. Maybe something about their shape? Or historical context? But I can't mention weapons. Maybe materials? Steel is common, but that's a material, not sure if that's allowed. The rules say I can't use morphological variants, so \"swords\" is out, but \"steel\" might be okay as long as it's not a related word. Let me check the related words again: blade, weapon, sharp. Steel isn't listed, so maybe that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, think about how swords are used. They're often associated with knights, battles, chivalry. But those might be too vague. Maybe something about the handle? Hilt? Crossguard? Or the way it's held? Maybe \"long metal cutting tool with a hilt\" but \"tool\" might be okay. Wait, \"tool\" isn't a related word here. Let me check the rules again. The related words are blade, weapon, sharp. So \"tool\" is allowed. But \"metal\" is okay. Wait, but \"weapon\" is a related word, so I can't use",
