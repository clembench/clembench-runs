	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "crucial" without using any of the related words: critical, important, pivotal. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, crucial means something that is very important and necessary. But I can't use "important" or "necessary". Maybe use synonyms or other ways to express that. Words like vital, essential, key. But wait, are those considered related? The rules say I can't use the target word or parts of it, or morphological variants. Also, related words like critical, important, pivotal are off-limits. So maybe "vital" is okay? Let me check. "Crucial" comes from "crux", meaning the main point. So maybe avoid words that are too close in meaning.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of contexts where crucial is used. Like a crucial moment in a story, a crucial game in a series. Maybe use metaphors. For example, "the piece that holds the puzzle together" – but "puzzle" might not be related. Wait, the clue needs to be a single word or short phrase. Maybe "deciding factor" but that's two words. Or "turning point"? Hmm. Let me see. The example given in the problem was "CLUE: The piece that holds the puzzle together." So maybe a metaphor. Crucial is often the key element that makes everything work. So maybe "keystone" – but is that
