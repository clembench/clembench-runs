How else can I describe that?\n\nMaybe think of synonyms. Words like \"ordinarily\" or \"commonly\" but those might be related. Wait, the related words given are unremarkably, regularly, usually. So I can't use those. So I need another way.\n\nWhat's the opposite of \"abnormally\"? Maybe \"as expected\" but that's a bit long. Or \"as usual\" but \"usual\" is related. Hmm. Maybe \"standard\" or \"typical\". But \"typical\" might be okay? Let me check the rules again. The related words are the ones listed, so \"typical\" isn't in the list, so maybe that's allowed. Wait, the rules say \"related words which are provided below\" so the related words are those three. So I can use other words as long as they aren't those. So \"typical\" is okay.\n\nAlternatively, think of contexts where \"normally\" is used. Like \"under normal circumstances\". Maybe \"circumstances\" but that's not directly related.",
