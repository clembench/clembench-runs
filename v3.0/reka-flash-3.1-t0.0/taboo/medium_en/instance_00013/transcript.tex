	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt normally\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - unremarkably\\ \tt - regularly\\ \tt - usually\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 <reasoning>\\ \tt I need to come up with a clue for the word "normally" without using the word itself, any parts of it, or the related words like unremarkably, regularly, usually. Let me think.\\ \tt \\ \tt First, "normally" means in a usual or standard way. So maybe something about the usual state or behavior. But I can't use "usually" or "regularly" either. How else can I describe that?\\ \tt \\ \tt Maybe think of synonyms. Words like "ordinarily" or "commonly" but those might be related. Wait, the related words given are unremarkably, regularly, usually. So I can't use those. So I need another way.\\ \tt \\ \tt What's the opposite of "abnormally"? Maybe "as expected" but that's a bit long. Or "as usual" but "usual" is related. Hmm. Maybe "standard" or "typical". But "typical" might be okay? Let me check the rules again. The related words are the ones listed, so "typical" isn't in the list, so maybe that's allowed. Wait, the rules say "related words which are provided below" so the related words are those three. So I can use other words as long as they aren't those. So "typical" is okay.\\ \tt \\ \tt Alternatively, think of contexts where "normally" is used. Like "under normal circumstances". Maybe "circumstances" but that's not directly related.
