Let me think about what \"toilet\" refers to. It's a place or fixture where people go to relieve themselves. But I can't mention that directly.\n\nMaybe focus on the purpose. People use it for personal hygiene. But \"hygiene\" might be too close. Wait, maybe think about the items associated with a toilet. Like a seat, tank, handle, water... But I can't use \"flush\" since that's a related word. Maybe \"seat\" is okay? Or \"cistern\"? No, that's part of a toilet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think about the action. People sit on it, but I can't say \"sit\" because that's related to using it. Maybe \"private room\" but restroom is a related word. So can't use that. What else? Maybe \"sanitation\" but that's too vague. Or \"bathroom fixture\"? But restroom is related. Wait, restroom is a related word, so I can't use that either.\n\nWait, the rules say I can't use the target word or parts/morphological variants, and also the related words provided. So related words are flush, restroom, urinate. So I can't use any of those. So I need to think of other associations. Maybe the word \"",
