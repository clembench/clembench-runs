Let me start by thinking about what Alabama is known for.\n\nFirst, Alabama is a state in the USA, but I can't mention \"state\" or \"usa\". So I need to avoid those. Maybe think about famous things from Alabama. There's the Talladega Superspeedway, which is a famous NASCAR track. That's a place, but I should check if \"NASCAR\" is allowed. The related words given are usa, state, river. NASCAR isn't listed, so maybe it's okay. But I need to make sure the clue doesn't hint at the state indirectly. Wait, the clue can't use \"state\", so maybe mentioning a city or landmark is okay as long as it's not a related word.\n\nAnother thought: Alabama has a nickname. I think it's the \"Yellowhammer State\", but \"state\" is a related word, so I can't use that. Maybe the bird? The state bird is the yellowhammer. But again, \"state\" is off-limits. So maybe just mention the bird? But the clue should be a single word or short phrase. CLUE: YELLOWHAMMER? Wait, but the target word is alabama. If the clue is YELLOWHAMMER, does that lead to Alabama?",
