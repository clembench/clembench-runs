The word 'budget' is part of the clue, but it doesn't fit the description of a fussbudget directly. However, the prefix 'fuss-' points towards a word that might be related to being fussy. Considering the structure of the clue, I'll try a word that includes 'budg' and fits the description of someone who is fussy.\nguess: budgy\n\nguess", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-25 18:05:07.506337", "call_duration": "0:00:11.116101", "response": "explanation: The clue suggests a word that could describe someone who is very particular or fussy.
