You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:43:36.260882", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a common five-letter word that contains frequently used vowels and consonants.\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:43:36.261470", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = crone\nguess = stare\nguess_feedback = s<red> t<red> a<red> r<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:43:36.261627", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> a<red> r<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:43:38.249258", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: From the previous feedback, 'e' is correct in the last position, 'r' exists but in wrong position, and 's', 't', 'a' are not in the word.
