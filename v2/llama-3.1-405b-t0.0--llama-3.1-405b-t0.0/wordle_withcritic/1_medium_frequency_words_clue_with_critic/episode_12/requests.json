However, another word that comes to mind is \"spell\" and then \"witch\" -> \"wicca\" is not a valid word, but a related word is \"witch\" without the last two letters and an added \"h\" at the end is not a valid word either. Then I think of something that witches stereotypically wear: a \"pointy hat\". And I think of the word \"hat\" is too short, but \"point\" is not, but \"point\" is not as strongly associated with witches as I would like. Then I think of a word for a female witch: \"hag\" is too short, but I think of a word that rhymes with \"hag\" and is associated with witches: \"swag\" is not as strongly associated with witches as I would like.
