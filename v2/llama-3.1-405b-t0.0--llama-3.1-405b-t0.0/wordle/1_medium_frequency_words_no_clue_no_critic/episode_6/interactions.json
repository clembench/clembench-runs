This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:43.039410", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting my guess with a common five-letter English word, often found in many contexts and widely known.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:43.039890", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = linen\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:43.040051", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:45.152686", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: My next guess will include the letter \"e\" in a different position since it appeared as yellow in the previous feedback, and exclude the letters \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"s\" since they appeared as red.\nguess: fence"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:45.153150", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = linen\nguess = fence\nguess_feedback = f<red> e<yellow> n<green> c<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:45.153311", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: f<red> e<yellow> n<green> c<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:50:47.949886", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since the letter \"n\" appeared as green, I will keep it in the same position, and try to utilize the yellow \"e\" in a different position again.
