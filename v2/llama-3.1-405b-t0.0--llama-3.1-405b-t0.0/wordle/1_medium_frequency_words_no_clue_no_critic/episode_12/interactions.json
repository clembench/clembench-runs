You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:00.407467", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I will start by guessing a five-letter English word that is commonly used and has a mix of vowels and consonants, which will increase the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:00.407980", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = crone\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:00.408155", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:53:03.509755", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since \"e\" is correct and in the right position, and \"o\" is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess will try to utilize this information by choosing a word that has \"e\" at the end and \"o\" in a different position.
