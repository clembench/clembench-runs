You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:40.631131", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a commonly used five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, which increases the chances of getting at least one or two correct letters.\nguess: house"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:40.631611", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = imply\nguess = house\nguess_feedback = h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:40.631770", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:43.445219", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since all letters in the previous guess were incorrect, the next guess will be a new five-letter word that is unrelated to \"house\" and has a different set of letters, to maximize the chances of getting at least one correct letter.\nguess: brain"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:43.445636", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = imply\nguess = brain\nguess_feedback = b<red> r<red> a<red> i<yellow> n<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:43.445796", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> r<red> a<red> i<yellow> n<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:52:46.310746", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"i\" in the previous guess was marked yellow, indicating it is present in the target word but not in the correct position.
