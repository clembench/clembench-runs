	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: 1985 hit by heart\\ \tt

	 explanation: The 1985 hit song by the band Heart is "What About Love", but this is too long and doesn't meet the five-letter requirement. I noticed that another song by Heart around this time, "These Dreams", doesn't meet the requirement.  Their big late-1985 hit was "These Dreams" isn't the 5-letter answer but it has lots of single key words one word is ( songs have the word - alone). so pick a song by them having a one-word - Barracuda. One valid English word connected with (shark fish which musician may metaphor heart from) - takes risks meet five-letter-lowrcase state \\ \tt   guess: alone

	 explanation: The feedback shows that "a", "l", and "o" are not in the target word, while "n" and "e" are present but in the wrong position. Considering the clue about the 1985 hit by Heart, I'll think of another song by the band. One of their popular songs is " Alone doesn't work so think of another". The word "heart" itself doesn't meet the requirement, but I can try to find a word related to the band or music. Since "n" and "e" are present, my next guess will be a word that includes these letters and is related to music or the band.\\ \tt guess: nerve

	 explanation: The feedback shows that "n" and the first "e" are in the correct position, while "r", "v", and the second "e" are present but in the wrong position. With this information, I'll try to find a word that includes these letters and is related to music or the band Heart. Since "n" and "e" are in the correct position, my next guess will be a word that builds on this and tries to utilize the remaining letters in a different arrangement. I'll think of a word that could be a song title or a word related to the music industry.\\ \tt guess: never
