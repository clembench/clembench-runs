You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: kind of closet\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T14:00:15.459747", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The clue is \"kind of closet.\" Based on this, I'll start with a common type of closet, which is a 'pantry' or 'closet' often used for storage in many homes, however pantry has more than 5 letters, thus my first guess will be a 'press' used in some countries to mean a storage closet for clothes, however press is a more common word related to publishing or to apply pressure to something, none the less it has 5 letters as well as 'arise' which was changed to press, doesn't. \nguess: press"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T14:00:15.460399", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = linen\ntarget_word_clue = kind of closet\nguess = press\nguess_feedback = p<red> r<red> e<yellow> s<red> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T14:00:15.460563", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: p<red> r<red> e<yellow> s<red> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T14:00:18.502081", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The clue is \"kind of closet\" and based on the feedback for 'press', the letter 'e' was highlighted as yellow, indicating it's present in the correct word but at the wrong position.
