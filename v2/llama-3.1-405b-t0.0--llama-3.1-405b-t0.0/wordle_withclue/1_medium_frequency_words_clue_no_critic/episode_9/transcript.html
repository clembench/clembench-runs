        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;explanation:&quot; and &quot;guess:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/>guess: apple<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Do not generate any other text.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue: zoo critter<br/></p>

        <p>explanation: Based on the clue &quot;zoo critter&quot;, I&#x27;m thinking of a common animal found in zoos. One of the most popular zoo animals is the monkey, and a type of monkey is a &quot;lemur&quot;. However, since &quot;lemur&quot; has only 5 letters, I&#x27;m going to take a chance and guess it.<br/>guess: lemur</p>

        <p>explanation: The feedback shows that only the letter &quot;l&quot; is somewhat correct, but in the wrong position. Considering the clue &quot;zoo critter&quot; again, I&#x27;m thinking of another animal that starts with a different letter but has &quot;l&quot; in it. A common zoo animal that comes to mind is the &quot;llama&quot;, but since it has 5 letters and double &quot;l&quot;s, I&#x27;ll try to think of a different word. Another possibility is that the word contains the letter &quot;l&quot; but is a different type of animal, such as a &quot;lion&quot;. However, &quot;lion&quot; has only 4 letters, so I&#x27;ll add a letter to make it 5 letters. <br/>guess: lions</p>
