	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: fast\\ \tt

	 explanation: The clue "fast" makes me think of words related to speed or quickness. One word that comes to mind is "swift", but it has more than 5 letters. A shorter word that conveys a sense of speed is "quick", but it also has more than 5 letters. However, a 5-letter word that is related to "fast" is "rapid". \\ \tt guess: rapid

	 explanation: The feedback shows that only the letter "a" is somewhat correct, but it's in the wrong position. The clue "fast" still suggests a word related to speed or quickness. Considering the letter "a" and the clue, a new 5-letter word that comes to mind is "racer", but since the letter "r" was marked as incorrect, I'll try a different word that still conveys speed and includes the letter "a".\\ \tt guess: haste
