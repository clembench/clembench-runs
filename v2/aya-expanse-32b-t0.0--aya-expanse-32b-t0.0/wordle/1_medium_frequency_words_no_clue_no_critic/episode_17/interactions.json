You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:15.089673", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm starting with a common, balanced set of vowels and consonants to gather initial information.\nguess: audio"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:15.089956", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = scrum\nguess = audio\nguess_feedback = a<red> u<yellow> d<red> i<red> o<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:15.090046", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> u<yellow> d<red> i<red> o<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:17.471324", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Since 'a' and 'u' are in the wrong place but correct, I'll keep them and replace the incorrect letters with new ones to cover more possible vowels and consonants.\nguess: aurae"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:17.471630", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = scrum\nguess = aurae\nguess_feedback = a<red> u<yellow> r<green> a<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:17.471721", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> u<yellow> r<green> a<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-24T21:06:19.902493", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: 'r' is in the correct position, and 'a' and 'u' are correct but misplaced.
