You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: kind of closet\n"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01C8nGeJUrjgQVQcywXh9RLj", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAEo7XbgojVt1fBTUGbCy897JFZiYoExRV8NbnD0cNey3/nrF+dP0mToFMPjIw5TIOkYltnqMiqbVcKpYC9UFTsBIMhpSpOj81tHluIVxBGgyidPXlkZ05sAb3SgQiMNB4SD04uewPf71xQG9SQ+sglZC6Arj75ZrjaW3mMB4PIFYhJHfCZYD9dnOYzrSokipQWCP3jaYDz3lBXL1HQYG0TM2y5hWFolVvV0wEDvdoh/YUD/qAfdWHq4B85FkVmZPNUkgb57JDoFBssH99bUT+lXpXw7xPhQE0bk95dPgLlOs=", "thinking": "I need to guess a 5-letter word related to \"kind of closet\" in Wordle.\n\nLet me think about different types of closets:\n- LINEN (closet for storing linens) - 5 letters\n- CEDAR (cedar closet) - 5 letters\n- CLOSET itself is 6 letters so not valid\n- WARDROBE is 8 letters so not valid\n- PANTRY (a food closet) is 6 letters so not valid\n- BROOM (broom closet) - 5 letters\n- WALLS (walk-in closet) - 5 letters\n- SHELF - 5 letters (might be in a closet)\n- HANG or HANGS - 4 or 5 letters (related to hanging clothes in a closet)\n- WALK-IN is a type of closet but has a hyphen\n- CHEST (like a chest of drawers) - 5 letters\n\nLet me think about the most likely answer. I believe LINEN or CEDAR are good guesses since they directly describe types of closets. BROOM is also good but might be less common as a standalone term for a closet. CHEST could work but is more furniture than a closet type. SHELF could be part of any closet but not a type.\n\nI think I'll go with CEDAR as my first guess since cedar closets are specifically designed for storing clothes and protecting them from moths and insects.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: A cedar closet is a type of closet designed to store and protect clothing from moths and insects.
