His works include:\n- Exodus\n- Mila 18\n- Armageddon\n- Trinity\n- QB VII\n- Topaz\n\nI need to determine which of these (or possibly another Uris novel) was published in 1967 and has 5 letters.\n\nLooking at the list, \"Topaz\" has 5 letters, and I believe it was published around that time. Let me check if \"Topaz\" was indeed published in 1967 by Leon Uris.\n\nBased on my knowledge, Leon Uris's novel \"Topaz\" was indeed published in 1967. It's a spy thriller that was later adapted into a film by Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nSo my first guess will be \"topaz\".", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: Leon Uris published the novel \"Topaz\" in 1967, which is a spy thriller that was later adapted into a film by Alfred Hitchcock.
