You can give only one command at each turn but it can refer to single or multiple cells, rows, columns or even the whole grid at once. When you have described everything, you say \"Command: DONE\". Only give the command and omit everything else.\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nCommand: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next command?\nCommand: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ K K ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\nWhat is your next command?\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put K in first row third column and first row fourth column"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put K in second row fifth column, third row fifth column, and fifth row fifth column"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Command: Put K in fourth row second column"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is your next command?"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01P9t6dnrTAqvBw6wkeXUSJ9", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAAngFCfQPuvd5V3vusbDl7ESAbluZ+T3qkIu8XCVVIe4pNOIbqREpGm/pZbXQbyoDBzghaF+N/5J8risG9E0p9xIMXvylFOeCGslV9iDhGgwYlTOxxL2O3o9sZMUiMOd5HKv8DCcMnUUG3fiTu3hF+FP0BbAu3tf9muDnTUqrUUaCyS8XCfzHiagtc1QNIypQnvT93zP+Hhldk6HwVo+U6E+aSJHjZopRuSDC1r0ug1VlbbskJYNdYHhY7TYzzmvK8HRmb11Bd24cwdx1+UL6TKu6x4N++Xz+qn2VkwvNXEQ=", "thinking": "Let me review the grid we're filling:\n\nOriginal grid:\n▢ ▢ K K ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n▢ K ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ K\n\nSo far, I've given commands for:\n1.
