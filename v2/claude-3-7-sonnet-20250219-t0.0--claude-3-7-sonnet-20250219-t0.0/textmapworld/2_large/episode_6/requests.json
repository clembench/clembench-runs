Bar - available directions: west, east\n6. Study room - available directions: south, west\n7. Solarium - available directions: north\n\nNow I'm in the Solarium, and the only available direction is north, which would take me back to the Study room (which I've already visited).\n\nLet me check if I've explored all possible rooms by examining whether there are any unexplored directions from the rooms I've visited:\n\n- Library: west (explored to Workshop), north (unexplored)\n- Workshop: east (explored to Library), north (explored to Laundry room)\n- Laundry room: south (explored to Workshop), north (explored to Pantry)\n- Pantry: south (explored to Laundry room), east (explored to Bar)\n- Bar: west (explored to Pantry), east (explored to Study room)\n- Study room: south (explored to Solarium), west (explored to Bar)\n- Solarium: north (explored to Study room)\n\nI notice I haven't explored the north direction from the Library. So I should go back there and try that direction.\n\nTo get back to the Library from the Solarium, I need to:\n1. Go north to the Study room\n2. Go west to the Bar\n3. Go west to the Pantry\n4. Go south to the Laundry room\n5. Go south to the Workshop\n6. Go east to the Library\n\nBut wait, the goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. I've already visited 7 rooms. Let me double-check if there are any other unexplored directions.\n\nI need to revisit the Library to go north. Let me check if there's any room I haven't visited yet.\n\nLet's think differently. I've been to:\n1. Library\n2. Workshop\n3. Laundry room\n4. Pantry\n5. Bar\n6. Study room\n7. Solarium\n\nI don't think I've missed any rooms, as I've explored all available directions from each room except north from the Library. Let me go back to the Library and explore north to see if there's any new room.\n\nActually, I should first check if I can reach any new room from my current position in the Solarium. The only direction is north, which takes me back to the Study room. From there, I can go west to the Bar, then west to the Pantry, south to the Laundry room, south to the Workshop, and east to the Library. Then I can go north from the Library to potentially discover a new room.\n\nLet me verify that I've visited all possible rooms based on the map I've explored so far:\n\n```\n    Pantry -- Bar -- Study room\n      |                 |\nLaundry room          Solarium\n      |\n   Workshop -- Library\n                 |\n               (Unknown)\n```\n\nThere's potentially an unexplored room to the north of the Library. I need to go back to the Library and go north to check.\n\nHowever, I need to be efficient.
