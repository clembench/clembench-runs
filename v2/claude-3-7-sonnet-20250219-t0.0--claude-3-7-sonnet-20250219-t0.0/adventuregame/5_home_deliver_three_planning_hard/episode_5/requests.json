I now need to:\n\n1. Find a book somewhere else (I need to check other locations)\n2. Once I find the book, put it in this wardrobe\n3. Find a table to put the mop on (there's one in the pantry, but should check living room too in case there's another table that might be more suitable)\n\nLet me continue searching for the book. I've checked:\n- Broom closet (just had mop and broom)\n- Kitchen (cupboard had a plate, counter was empty, freezer now has the sandwich)\n- Pantry (had a refrigerator with food and a table)\n- Bedroom (wardrobe has a pillow, nothing else noted)\n\nI haven't checked the living room yet. That seems like the most likely place to find a book.\n\nMy plan:\n1. Go back to hallway\n2. Go to living room\n3. Look for the book\n4. Once I find the book, bring it back to put in the wardrobe\n5.
