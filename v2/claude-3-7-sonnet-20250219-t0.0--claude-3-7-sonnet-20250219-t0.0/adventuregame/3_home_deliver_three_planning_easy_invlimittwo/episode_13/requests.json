Since the game specifically named it as a \"side table\" rather than just \"a table,\" there might be another table somewhere else.\n\nLet me think about this carefully:\n1. The goal is to put the book, plate, and mop on \"the table\"\n2. I've put the plate and mop on the \"side table\"\n3. The book was already on the \"side table\"\n\nI have two options:\n1. Assume \"side table\" counts as \"the table\" mentioned in the goal, in which case I'm done\n2. Look for another table that might be called just \"table\" somewhere else\n\nSince I've been to most rooms and haven't seen another table, and since all three required objects are now on the side table, I think it's reasonable to assume the side table is the table referred to in the goal.
