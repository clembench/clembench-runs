You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue: hint at\n"}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01KJd96nJoy1g1ohLV7iLgxC", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAsdjHxRQQFhIiGUd/8GdDqxiaug8prdFPWYe1ldZSsqBX6gAZ+V5rb9CYSgyo3PrlY+LR0aMS2D/YjlPJUTSMNhIMGxAxnQCl4/mfZ9YTGgzy/T482F+2jcdSESkiMDO7xcmUSVlFVrB9dqMwWThnYDk/kIx/XMRrFsDnW7uATEqLqkDVBBLxN9rkD6lH/SpQTFS5C01y8MGKHOfNxXy3JUhLvH2toPBgtPo7J6fzRJQdyeJC6CxUXAV2OP4DqRTzW6XHer6qqx3MvLFKlo4UYcvTUOHqpjUf5u7e8lW7a24=", "thinking": "Let me think about the clue \"hint at\" and what 5-letter words could be related to this phrase.\n\n\"Hint at\" means to suggest or imply something indirectly. Words that could be related to this concept:\n\n- POINT (to point at something can be a hint)\n- IMPLY (to imply or suggest)\n- CLUES (related to hints, but plural)\n- INFER (what someone does with a hint)\n- ALLUDE (to refer to something indirectly)\n- NUDGE (a gentle hint)\n- REFER (to refer to something)\n- GUIDE (to guide someone with hints)\n- QUEUE (a subtle signal)\n- IMPEL (to urge or hint strongly)\n- HINT (direct match to the clue, but only 4 letters)\n- GUISE (appearance that hints at something)\n- VAGUE (hints are often vague)\n- NOTES (can contain hints)\n- SHADE (to hint at subtly)\n- TAINT (to color or hint at something negative)\n- TRACE (a hint or vestige of something)\n- MARKS (signs that hint at something)\n- SPOOR (a trace or hint left behind)\n\nLooking at the words that are exactly 5 letters:\n- POINT\n- IMPLY\n- CLUES\n- INFER\n- ALLUDE (too many letters)\n- NUDGE\n- REFER\n- GUIDE\n- IMPEL\n- GUISE\n- VAGUE\n- NOTES\n- SHADE\n- TAINT\n- TRACE\n- MARKS\n- SPOOR\n\nActually, ALLUDE has 6 letters, so it's not valid. From the remaining options, I think POINT or HINTS would be good guesses, but HINTS has only 5 letters if it's plural. Let me check HINTS... no, the singular HINT has 4 letters, so HINTS would be 5, but we need a valid English word.\n\nI think POINT is the strongest connection to \"hint at\" - when you point at something, you're giving a hint. POINT also has exactly 5 letters.\n\nWait, let me verify if HINTS is a valid 5-letter word for Wordle. Actually, in Wordle, we need a singular noun or verb form, not plurals. So HINTS wouldn't be appropriate here.\n\nLet me consider a few more words:\n- SHOWS (shows something = hints at it)\n- TELLS (tells indirectly = hints)\n- CITES (citing something can be a way to hint)\n- DIRGE (a subtle direction)\n- SIGNS (signs can be hints)\n- NOTES (taking notes on hints)\n- GESTURING (too long)\n- WINKS (a wink can be a hint)\n- NODS (a nod can be a hint)\n\nI'm leaning toward POINT as my guess, as it has a clear connection to the clue \"hint at\" and is exactly 5 letters.\n\nActually, let me think of the word \"INFER\" more carefully. \"Infer\" is what one does from a hint, rather than giving a hint itself. So while related, it's not the strongest connection.\n\nLet me try another word: IMPLY. To \"hint at\" something is very similar to implying it. Both involve suggesting something indirectly. IMPLY has 5 letters and seems to be a good match for the clue.\n\nI'll go with IMPLY for my first guess.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: When someone \"hints at\" something, they're implying it without stating it directly.
