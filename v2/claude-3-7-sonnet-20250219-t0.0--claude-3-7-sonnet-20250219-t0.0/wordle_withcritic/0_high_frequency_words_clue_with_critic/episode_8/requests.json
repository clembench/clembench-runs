I need to think about their notable songs from 1985 specifically.\n\nOne of Heart's biggest hits from 1985 was \"What About Love\" - but that's not a five-letter word.\n\nAnother major hit from Heart in 1985 was \"Never\" - that's only 5 letters, so it could be our target.\n\nThey also had a hit called \"These Dreams\" in 1985/1986 - \"dream\" would be 5 letters.\n\nLet me think about other Heart hits from around that time:\n- \"Alone\" (4 letters)\n- \"Crazy on You\" (not 5 letters)\n- \"Barracuda\" (too many letters)\n- \"Magic Man\" (not 5 letters)\n- \"Nothin' at All\" (not 5 letters)\n\nLooking at their major 1985 hits, \"Never\" seems like the most likely candidate as it's exactly 5 letters. It was on their self-titled album \"Heart\" which was released in 1985 and was a major hit for them.\n\nSo my first guess will be \"never\".", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: Heart had a major hit in 1985 called \"Never\" which reached high positions on music charts.
