You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess.

This appears to be referencing a song by Sammy Kaye where the blank would be filled with a 5-letter word.\n\nThe song that fits this description is likely \"I'll Be Seeing You Tomorrow\" or possibly something like \"Until Tomorrow\". I need to determine what the 5-letter word might be that completes the title.\n\nSome possibilities:\n1. \"UNTIL tomorrow\" - \"UNTIL\" has 5 letters\n2. \"DREAM tomorrow\" - \"DREAM\" has 5 letters\n3. \"SUNNY tomorrow\" - \"SUNNY\" has 5 letters\n4. \"HELLO tomorrow\" - \"HELLO\" has 5 letters\n5. \"SWEET tomorrow\" - \"SWEET\" has 5 letters\n\nAfter some thought, I believe this could be referencing \"I'll See You Tomorrow\" or a similar song by Sammy Kaye. \n\nLet me try to narrow this down. Since this is a hit by Sammy Kaye, looking at his discography might help. One of his famous songs is called \"I'll Be Seeing You,\" but I'm trying to think of a song with a 5-letter word followed by \"tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother possibility is that it could be something like \"THERE tomorrow\" or \"MAYBE tomorrow.\"\n\nI recall that Sammy Kaye had a hit called \"There'll Be Some Changes Made,\" but that doesn't fit our pattern.\n\nI think the most likely option is either:\n1. \"UNTIL tomorrow\"\n2. \"MAYBE tomorrow\"\n\nSince I need to make a guess with a 5-letter word, I'll go with \"UNTIL\" as my first guess, as it seems the most plausible completion for a song title.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "explanation: The clue refers to a Sammy Kaye hit song with the format \"[5-letter word] tomorrow\".
