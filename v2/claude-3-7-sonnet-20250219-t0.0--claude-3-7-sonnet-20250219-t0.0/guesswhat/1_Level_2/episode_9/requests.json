Flounders are flatfish that have a characteristic where both of their eyes are located on the same side of their body. This is a distinctive feature of flounders and other flatfish.\n\nWhen flounder are born, they have eyes on both sides of their body like most fish. But as they develop, one eye migrates to the other side, so that both eyes end up on the same side. This adaptation allows them to lie flat on the ocean floor on their eyeless side.\n\nSo the answer is yes, flounders do have both eyes on the same side of their body.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "ANSWER: yes", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 227, "output_tokens": 148}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 21:09:40.167044", "call_duration": "0:00:03.350459", "response": "ANSWER: yes", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-25T21:09:49.991460", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Let's play a guessing game.

Halibut is also a flatfish with eyes on one side, but the size question makes me think it's probably not Halibut since many halibut species can grow quite large.\n\nLet me check if there are any other distinguishing features between these two flatfish options before making my guess.\n\nI believe Flounder is the most likely answer based on all the information I've gathered:\n1.
