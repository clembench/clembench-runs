Garage - explored north\n\nLet me check if there are any unexplored directions:\n- Music room: We've explored east (to Craft room) and south (to Game room)\n- Craft room: We've explored north (to Kitchen), south (to Bar), and west (to Music room)\n- Kitchen: We've explored south (to Craft room)\n- Bar: We've explored north (to Craft room)\n- Game room: We've explored south (to Garage) and north (to Music room)\n- Garage: We've explored north (to Game room)\n\nIt seems we've explored all available directions in all rooms. \n\nGame room currently has directions north and south. We've already gone north (to Music room) and south (to Garage).\n\nSince we've visited all rooms and explored all available directions, I believe we're done with the exploration.\n\nLet me create the final graph:\n\nNodes: [\"Music room\", \"Craft room\", \"Kitchen\", \"Bar\", \"Game room\", \"Garage\"]\n\nEdges:\n- North: [(\"Craft room\", \"Kitchen\"), (\"Bar\", \"Craft room\"), (\"Game room\", \"Music room\"), (\"Garage\", \"Game room\")]\n- South: [(\"Kitchen\", \"Craft room\"), (\"Craft room\", \"Bar\"), (\"Music room\", \"Game room\"), (\"Game room\", \"Garage\")]\n- East: [(\"Music room\", \"Craft room\")]\n- West: [(\"Craft room\", \"Music room\")]\n\nWait, let me double-check. Game room has north and south directions available, and we've already gone in both directions. So there are no unexplored directions from Game room.\n\nActually, let's do one more check. Have we gone back to north from Game room to see if we get to Music room? Yes, we went north from Game room and reached Music room earlier. And we also went south from Game room to reach Garage. So we've fully explored Game room.\n\nLet me review all rooms again:\n- Music room: We've explored east (to Craft room) and south (to Game room)\n- Craft room: We've explored north (to Kitchen), south (to Bar), and west (to Music room)\n- Kitchen: We've explored south (to Craft room)\n- Bar: We've explored north (to Craft room)\n- Game room: We've explored south (to Garage) and north (to Music room)\n- Garage: We've explored north (to Game room)\n\nI believe we've explored all rooms and directions, so we're done.\n\nHold on - it seems we're in Game room and the prompt says \"Currently available directions: north, south\".
