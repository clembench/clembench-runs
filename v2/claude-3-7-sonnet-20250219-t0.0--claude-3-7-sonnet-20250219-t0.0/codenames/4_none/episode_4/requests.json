Let me go with \"white\" as it potentially connects to all four remaining team words.\n\nActually, let me consider a few more options:\n9. \"Throne\" - could connect to chair (a type of special chair), himalayas (throne of the gods in some mythologies), and possibly china (imperial throne), but not really diamond.\n10. \"Royal\" - could connect to chair (throne), diamond (crown jewels), china (imperial china/royal porcelain), but not himalayas directly.\n\nI think \"royal\" actually works quite well for chair, diamond, and china. Let me go with that.\n\nWait, I need to be careful with \"royal\" as it might lead to \"king\" which is a distractor word.\n\nLet me think of a few more options:\n11. \"Elegant\" - could connect to chair (fine furniture), diamond (jewelry), china (fine dinnerware), but not himalayas.\n12. \"Precious\" - works well for diamond and china, possibly chair (antique chair), but not himalayas.\n\nSince I haven't been able to find a single word that strongly connects to all four remaining team words, I should prioritize connecting as many as possible with a strong, clear clue.\n\nLet me go with \"elegant\" as my clue, targeting chair, diamond, and china.\n\nWait, actually I just realized another good option:\n13. \"Crystal\" - connects to diamond (similar clear, precious material), china (crystal glassware often goes with fine china), and possibly himalayas (crystal clear ice/snow), but not really chair.\n\n\"Crystal\" might be too close to \"diamond\" itself though.\n\nActually, since mountain is clearly covered in previous clues for Himalayas, and we might be running out of turns, let me focus on the other three words:\n\n\"Furniture\" could connect chair and china (china cabinet), but might be too obvious for chair.\n\"Shiny\" could connect to diamond and china (glazed porcelain), and possibly a polished chair.\n\"Antique\" could connect to chair, china, and possibly diamond (antique jewelry).\n\nI think \"antique\" is a good option for chair, china, and possibly diamond.\n\nOne more option:\n\"Ornate\" - could connect to chair (decorative chair), china (decorated porcelain), and diamond (in ornate jewelry settings).\n\nBetween \"elegant\", \"antique\", and \"ornate\", I think \"ornate\" gives the clearest connections to chair, china, and diamond.\n\nLet me reassess once more. \n\nI think \"polish\" could also work well - you polish diamonds, polish wood furniture like chairs, and china is a polished ceramic. This could be a good clue for chair, china, and diamond.\n\nGoing with \"polish\" as my clue for chair, china, and diamond.
