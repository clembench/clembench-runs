connects to \"legos\" (opponent word)\n- \"Home\" - might connect to \"van\" (opponent word) as some vans are converted to homes\n\nLet me think of more targeted clues:\n1. \"Accommodation\" - connects to shack, tent, house, hotel (4 words)\n2. \"Lodging\" - connects to shack, tent, house, hotel (4 words)\n3. \"Residence\" - connects to shack, house, hotel (3 words)\n4. \"Yellow\" - connects to daffodil, dandelion (2 words)\n5. \"Purple\" - connects to lilac (1 word)\n6. \"Petal\" -
