Let me go with that approach.\n\nFor smallpox, measles, and malaria, a good clue might be:\n- \"epidemic\" - all three can cause epidemics\n- \"fever\" - all three typically cause fever\n- \"outbreak\" - all three can cause outbreaks\n- \"tropical\" - malaria is tropical, and the others can occur in tropical regions (though this is weaker)\n\nI think the strongest clue is \"epidemic\" which clearly connects smallpox, measles, and malaria.
