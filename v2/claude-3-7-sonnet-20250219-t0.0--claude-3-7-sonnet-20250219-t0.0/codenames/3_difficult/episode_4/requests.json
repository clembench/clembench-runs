I need to be careful to avoid any connection to the kill word \"hummingbird\".\n\nRemaining team words:\n- aluminum\n- sheep\n- hose\n- shears\n- centimeter\n- cave\n- neck\n\nPossible connections:\n1. \"Metal\" - could connect aluminum, but might also connect to opponent words like iron and copper.\n2. \"Measure\" - could connect centimeter, but might also connect to opponent word meter.\n3. \"Water\" - could connect hose and cave (caves often have water), but it's a bit of a stretch.\n4. \"Cut\" - could connect shears and hose (you cut with shears, and hoses can be cut), maybe even neck (cutting a neck, though morbid).\n5. \"Wool\" - connects to sheep and possibly shears (used for shearing sheep)\n6. \"Garden\" - connects to hose and shears\n7. \"Dark\" - could connect cave and possibly neck (dark turtleneck?)\n8. \"Long\" - could connect hose, neck, and cave (long cave tunnels)\n9. \"Clip\" - connects to shears and possibly neck (clip-on tie around neck)\n\nI think \"wool\" is a good clue for sheep and shears, with minimal risk of connection to opponent, distractor, or kill words.\n\nAnother option is \"garden\" for hose and shears, also with low risk.\n\nLet me also consider \"underground\" for cave and possibly aluminum (as it's mined).\n\n\"Flexible\" could work for hose and neck (both are flexible), and maybe sheep (they're herded/flexible in movement).\n\nI think \"wool\" is the safest with clear connections, but only connects to two words. \"Flexible\" could connect to three, but the connections are less obvious.\n\nLet me try \"mineral\" - connects to aluminum (it's a mineral-based metal) and cave (caves contain minerals). This seems safer than \"metal\" which would connect to opponent words.\n\nActually, I'll go with \"flexible\" for hose, neck, and sheep. It's three words with reasonable connections and low risk.\n\nActually, I need to consider the board state more carefully. Since we've already guessed doctor and chicken, we have 7 words left to guess and the opponent has 7 words left. We should try to be efficient with our clues.\n\nLet me think about stronger groupings:\n\n\"Material\" could connect aluminum, sheep (wool material), and hose (rubber material).\n\n\"Length\" could connect hose, neck, centimeter.\n\nI think I'll go with \"cut\" for shears, neck, and hose.
