Since I still have 5 words left, I might want to prioritize getting as many as possible with one clue.\n\nWhat about \"outback\" as a clue?\n- Connects to australia (the Australian Outback)\n- Could connect to police (outback police/patrols)\n- Could connect to mount (outback terrain requires mounting/climbing)\n\nWhat about \"protection\"?\n- Connects to police (they protect people)\n- Connects to poison (protection against poison)\n- Connects to button (protective covering, protective buttons like emergency buttons)\n\nWhat about \"authority\"?\n- Connects to police (they have authority)\n- Could connect to mount (authorities mount operations)\n- Could connect to button (authority to press a button)\n\nLet me consider \"wildlife\":\n- Connects to australia (known for unique wildlife)\n- Connects to poison (poisonous wildlife)\n- Connects to mount (wildlife on mountains)\n\nI think \"wildlife\" is a good clue that connects australia, poison, and mount without obvious connections to opponent words or the kill word.\n\nActually, let me check one more - \"security\":\n- Connects to police (security forces)\n- Connects to button (security buttons, security systems)\n- Could connect to poison (security against poisoning)\n- Could connect to mount (security cameras are mounted)\n\n\"Security\" seems to connect to more of my words than \"wildlife\" does. Let me double-check that it doesn't connect to opponent words, distractors, or the kill word:\n- It might connect weakly to \"war\" (security concerns in wartime)\n- It might connect to \"revolution\" (security measures during revolutions)\n\nLet me try \"officer\":\n- Connects to police (police officer)\n- Could connect to australia (Australian officers)\n- Could connect to button (officer's uniform has buttons)\n\nI think \"security\" is still my best option despite the weak connections to opponent words.
