These could connect:\n- pedometer (function: measure steps)\n- scooter (function: transportation)\n- pocketknife (function: multi-purpose cutting)\n- pickaxe (function: digging/breaking)\n- flyswatter (function: kill flies)\n- peroxide (function: cleaning/disinfecting/bleaching)\n\nI think \"function\" is good but might be too abstract. What about something more specific like \"outdoor\" or \"adventure\"?\n\nOutdoor/adventure items:\n- ball (for outdoor play)\n- pedometer (for tracking outdoor walks/hikes)\n- scooter (outdoor transportation)\n- pocketknife (outdoor/camping tool)\n- pickaxe (outdoor digging/mining)\n- flyswatter (for outdoor pests)\n\nLet me try \"camping\" as a clue:\n- bedsheet (sleeping)\n- pocketknife (versatile camping tool)\n- pickaxe (setting up tent, etc.)\n- scooter (less directly related)\n- ball (recreation at campsite)\n\nHowever, \"camping\" might connect to opponent words like \"binoculars\" or distractor words like \"wasp\" (camping pest).\n\nWhat about \"sports\"?\n- ball (used in many sports)\n- pedometer (used to track exercise)\n- scooter (scooter sports exist)\n- maybe necklace (sports medals/trophies)\n\nI think \"utility\" or \"function\" might be my best bets for connecting multiple words. Let me try \"utility\" as a final choice, connecting:\n- pedometer (utility for measuring steps)\n- scooter (utility for transportation)\n- pocketknife (utility tool)\n- pickaxe (utility for digging)\n- flyswatter (utility for pest control)\n- peroxide (utility for cleaning/disinfecting)\n\nI'll go with \"utility\" as my clue word, connecting these 6 words.\n\nActually, let me try one more approach.

What about \"hand\"?\n- ball (held in hand)\n- pedometer (can be held in hand)\n- scooter (controlled by hands)\n- pocketknife (used with hands)\n- pickaxe (held with hands)\n- flyswatter (held with hands)\n- necklace (put on with hands)\n\nThis connects 7 words but might have connections to:\n- flute (played with hands)\n- binoculars (held with hands)\n- watchband (worn on wrist near hand)\n- saltshaker (used with hands)\n- jelly (eaten with hands or utensils)\n\nLet me try \"plastic\" as a material that might connect several team words:\n- ball (often made of plastic)\n- pedometer (typically has plastic parts)\n- scooter (often has plastic components)\n- pocketknife (might have plastic handle)\n- flyswatter (often plastic)\n- necklace (can have plastic beads/components)\n- peroxide (comes in plastic bottle)\n\nThis connects 7 words and seems less likely to connect to opponent/distractor words.\n\nLet me check if \"plastic\" connects to opponent/distractor words:\n- teeth (natural, not plastic)\n- flute (typically metal/wood, not plastic)\n- cuticle (natural, not plastic)\n- bandanna (fabric, not plastic)\n- binoculars (might have plastic parts - potential connection)\n- fish (natural, not plastic)\n- elbow (natural, not plastic)\n- watchband (typically leather/metal, but could be plastic - potential connection)\n\nAmong distractors:\n- blackbird (animal, not plastic)\n- tail (animal part, not plastic)\n- wasp (insect, not plastic)\n- taxicab (vehicle, typically metal not primarily plastic)\n- saltshaker (could be plastic - potential connection)\n- eyeball (natural, not plastic)\n- jelly (food, not plastic)\n\nThe kill word:\n- undershirt (fabric, not plastic)\n\nHmm, plastic connects to some problematic words too.\n\nLet me try \"store\" as in items you would buy at a store:\n- ball (sold in stores)\n- bedsheet (sold in stores)\n- pedometer (sold in stores)\n- scooter (sold in stores)\n- pocketknife (sold in stores)\n- pickaxe (sold in stores)\n- flyswatter (sold in stores)\n- necklace (sold in stores)\n- peroxide (sold in stores)\n\nThis connects all 9 team words! But it probably connects to many opponent/distractor words too since most manufactured items are sold in stores.\n\nLet me go with \"gadget\" as my final clue, connecting:\n- pedometer (fitness gadget)\n- scooter (transportation gadget)\n- pocketknife (utility gadget)\n- flyswatter (simple gadget)\n- peroxide (chemical, not a gadget)\n\nThis connects 4 words and seems less likely to connect strongly to opponent/distractor words.\n\nLet me check if \"gadget\" connects to opponent/distractor words:\n- teeth (natural, not gadget)\n- flute (instrument, not typically considered gadget)\n- cuticle (body part, not gadget)\n- bandanna (accessory, not gadget)\n- binoculars (could be considered a gadget - potential connection)\n- fish (animal, not gadget)\n- elbow (body part, not gadget)\n- watchband (part of a watch which is a gadget - potential connection)\n\nAmong distractors:\n- blackbird (animal, not gadget)\n- tail (animal part, not gadget)\n- wasp (insect, not gadget)\n- taxicab (vehicle, not typically called a gadget)\n- saltshaker (kitchen tool, not typically called a gadget)\n- eyeball (body part, not gadget)\n- jelly (food, not gadget)\n\nThe kill word:\n- undershirt (clothing, not gadget)\n\n\"Gadget\" has potential connections to binoculars and watchband, which isn't ideal.\n\nAfter considering various options, I'm going to choose \"equipment\" as my clue word, connecting:\n- ball (sports equipment)\n- pedometer (fitness equipment)\n- scooter (transportation equipment)\n- pocketknife (tool equipment)\n- pickaxe (digging equipment)\n- flyswatter (pest control equipment)\n- necklace (not equipment)\n- peroxide (cleaning equipment/supply)\n\nThis connects 7 out of 9 team words.\n\nLet me check if \"equipment\" connects to opponent/distractor words:\n- teeth (body part, not equipment)\n- flute (musical equipment - problematic connection)\n- cuticle (body part, not equipment)\n- bandanna (accessory, not typically equipment)\n- binoculars (viewing equipment - problematic connection)\n- fish (animal, not equipment)\n- elbow (body part, not equipment)\n- watchband (accessory, not typically equipment)\n\nAmong distractors:\n- blackbird (animal, not equipment)\n- tail (animal part, not equipment)\n- wasp (insect, not equipment)\n- taxicab (vehicle, could be considered transportation equipment - problematic)\n- saltshaker (kitchen tool, not typically called equipment)\n- eyeball (body part, not equipment)\n- jelly (food, not equipment)\n\nThe kill word:\n- undershirt (clothing, not equipment)\n\n\"Equipment\" has problematic connections to flute, binoculars, and possibly taxicab.\n\nI think I need to be more specific or go with fewer connections.

But maybe too vague.\n\n2. \"Tool\" - Could connect to pocketknife, pickaxe, flyswatter. This is a good option.\n\n3. \"Accessory\" - Could connect to necklace, pocketknife, pedometer. This works for some items.\n\n4. \"White\" - Could connect to bedsheet, peroxide. But not many words.\n\n5. \"Clean\" - Could connect to peroxide, bedsheet, maybe flyswatter (for cleaning flies). This has potential.\n\n6. \"Sharp\" - Could connect to pocketknife, pickaxe. Limited but strong connection.\n\n7. \"Household\" - Could connect to bedsheet, flyswatter, peroxide, ball (toy). This has good potential.\n\n8. \"Outdoor\" - Could connect to ball, scooter, pickaxe, maybe flyswatter. This is decent.\n\n9. \"Portable\" - Could connect to pedometer, scooter, pocketknife, maybe ball. This is good.\n\nThe connections with the most words seem to be \"tool\", \"household\", \"portable\", and maybe \"outdoor\".\n\nLet me check if any of these might also connect to the opponent's words, distractors, or the kill word:\n\nOpponent words: teeth, flute, cuticle, bandanna, fish, elbow, watchband\nDistractors: blackbird, tail, wasp, taxicab, saltshaker, eyeball, jelly\nKill word: undershirt\n\n\"Tool\" could possibly connect to flute (musical tool)\n\"Household\" could connect to saltshaker\n\"Portable\" could connect to flute, bandanna, watchband\n\"Outdoor\" could connect to fish, blackbird, wasp\n\nI think \"tool\" is still my best bet, as it has strong connections to several of my team's words and minimal connection to opponent's words.\n\nSo my clue will be \"tool\" and it will relate to pocketknife, pickaxe, and flyswatter.\n\nActually, I think I can add \"pedometer\" to my list as well.
