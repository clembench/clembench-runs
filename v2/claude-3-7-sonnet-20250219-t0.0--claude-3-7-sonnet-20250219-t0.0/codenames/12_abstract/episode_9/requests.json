Not strongly related to melancholy.\n\n7. impetuousness - acting impulsively. Not related to melancholy, which is more contemplative.\n\n8. unhappiness - general state of not being happy.

While defeatism can lead to melancholy, they're not inherently the same.\n\n16. sociability - being friendly or sociable. This is almost opposite to melancholy, which often involves withdrawal.\n\n17. proneness - tendency toward something.
