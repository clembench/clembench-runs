You can choose to how many and to which words your clue relates to.\nThe goal is to have your partner guess all of your team's words based on the clues you give them, before the other team has uncovered all of theirs. If your partner guesses an 'opponent' or a 'distractor' word, their guessing turn ends and the opposing team gets to make a turn. If your partner guesses a 'kill' word, the game ends and your team loses immediately.\nThe more words your clue relates to, the quicker you can win the game, but the harder the associations may be to guess for your partner, so choose your clue word wisely. The clue word has to be semantically related to the target words, it cannot be one of the words in the lists or contain parts of them.\n\nAlways give your single-word clue and your comma-separated list of related target words in the following format and make your answers as short as possible, never include any other text than is required in this form:\n\nCLUE: <WORD>\nTARGETS: <TARGETS>\n\nYour team words are: ghost, time, row, web, pyramid, snow, server, shakespeare, pupil.\nYour opponent's team words are: buck, march, pan, fence, screen, cycle, circle, stadium.\nDistractor words are: calf, stick, point.\nThe kill words are: police, ninja, plate, state, agent."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01RCqmBosxGt7Fpkm9HJgrqp", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAVIheQq1UEZZoPwPsAA3/rcmdfaD6G719iX8nEjcqHIKvp5BGruolfZkralkiQWKKD15P3D92YHByN8wfDpfWihIMilBYCt7wSGRDDwN/GgwxtUJ95hoebPZb7NUiMOu7MWsLSZ/ENWadVkPqlE0NDD51tcZwji+lMok88LTyhH/7McjfNgBYZpE5cFYDtSpQDZcvs8kEW1WvrgQg1KqUL6p9ehiERFttKsKhb0hPinJrU8gSQCCars8zXrbiMaJT5FG8HvjdwiTCotEZSxRX0PJlgD1xsCEiIicVoMNm3cM=", "thinking": "Let me analyze our team's words and find a clue that can connect multiple words together.\n\nOur team's words:\n1. ghost\n2. time\n3. row\n4. web\n5. pyramid\n6. snow\n7. server\n8. shakespeare\n9. pupil\n\nI need to avoid opponent's words, distractors, and especially kill words.\n\nLet me try to find some connections between our team's words:\n\nGhost and Shakespeare could be linked by \"supernatural\" or \"spirit\" or \"play\"\nTime and Shakespeare could be linked by \"history\" or \"period\"\nWeb could be linked to \"network\" or \"internet\"\nServer is also connected to \"network\" or \"internet\"\nPupil could be linked to \"student\" who might study Shakespeare\nSnow and pyramid - possibly \"ancient\" (snow-capped pyramids) but that's a stretch\nRow could be interpreted as \"line\"\nTime and row could be connected by \"linear\"\n\nLet me consider some possible clue words:\n\n\"History\" could connect:\n- Shakespeare (historical figure)\n- Time (historical periods)\n- Pyramid (historical structures)\nBut it doesn't strongly connect to the other words.\n\n\"Internet\" could connect:\n- Web (world wide web)\n- Server (web server)\nBut doesn't connect to the others strongly.\n\n\"Ancient\" could connect:\n- Pyramid (ancient structures)\n- Shakespeare (ancient literature, though not really ancient)\n- Ghost (ancient spirits)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\n\"White\" could connect:\n- Snow (white in color)\n- Ghost (traditionally depicted as white)\n- Pyramid (white limestone covering)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\n\"Writer\" could connect:\n- Shakespeare (famous writer)\n- Ghost (ghostwriter)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\n\"School\" could connect:\n- Pupil (student in school)\n- Shakespeare (studied in school)\n- Row (rows of desks)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\n\"Spirit\" could connect:\n- Ghost (a spirit)\n- Shakespeare (wrote about spirits/ghosts in his plays like Hamlet)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\n\"Line\" could connect:\n- Row (a line of items)\n- Shakespeare (lines in his plays)\nBut doesn't connect well to the others.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's examine each of our team's words and see what concepts they might relate to:\n\nGhost: spirit, supernatural, invisible, haunt, spooky, dead, apparition\nTime: clock, hours, duration, period, era, history, measurement\nRow: line, series, order, argument, boat, oar\nWeb: internet, spider, network, trap, intricate\nPyramid: Egypt, structure, hierarchy, ancient, tomb, shape\nSnow: winter, cold, white, precipitation, ice, crystal\nServer: computer, network, waiter, restaurant, data, host\nShakespeare: playwright, author, literature, theater, drama, Elizabethan\nPupil: student, eye, learner, education, school\n\nLooking at these associations, I think the concept of \"network\" could potentially connect:\n- Web (internet network)\n- Server (computer network)\n- Shakespeare (network of characters and plots)\n- Ghost (network of paranormal investigators)\n\nThe concept of \"ancient\" could connect:\n- Pyramid (ancient structure)\n- Shakespeare (ancient playwright, relatively speaking)\n- Ghost (ancient spirit)\n- Time (ancient times)\n\nThe concept of \"drama\" could connect:\n- Shakespeare (playwright)\n- Ghost (dramatic supernatural element)\n- Row (dramatic argument)\n\nThe concept of \"winter\" could connect:\n- Snow (winter weather)\n- Shakespeare (Winter's Tale)\n- Time (wintertime)\n\nLet me think more broadly...\n\nWhat about \"stage\"?\n- Shakespeare (stage plays)\n- Ghost (appears on stage in Hamlet)\n- Time (staging in time)\n- Row (row of seats in a theater)\n- Server (stage waiter)\n\nI think \"stage\" connects to several of our team's words and is unlikely to be associated with opponent's words or kill words. Let me try another option.\n\nWhat about \"history\"?\n- Time (historical periods)\n- Shakespeare (historical figure)\n- Pyramid (historical structures)\n- Ghost (historical hauntings)\n\nWhat about \"structure\"?\n- Pyramid (architectural structure)\n- Web (structured network)\n- Row (structured line)\n- Shakespeare (structured plays)\n- Time (structure of time)\n\nI think \"structure\" is a good option that connects to at least 5 of our team's words without strongly connecting to opponent's words or kill words.\n\nLet me check one more approach. What about \"ancient\"?\n- Pyramid (ancient structures)\n- Shakespeare (ancient literature)\n- Ghost (ancient spirits)\n- Time (ancient times)\n- Web (ancient spider webs)\n\n\"Ancient\" connects to several of our words but might not be as strong for some (like web).\n\nI believe \"structure\" is the strongest clue that connects multiple team words without risking confusion with opponent, distractor, or kill words.\n\nCLUE: STRUCTURE\nTARGETS: pyramid, web, row, shakespeare, time", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "CLUE: ANCIENT\nTARGETS: pyramid, ghost, shakespeare, time", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 376, "output_tokens": 1218}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 11:00:31.718626", "call_duration": "0:00:19.056537", "response": "CLUE: ANCIENT\nTARGETS: pyramid, ghost, shakespeare, time", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:00:59.394452", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Provide a comma-separated list of up to 4 words from the following list that best relate or are most closely associated with the word 'ancient'.
