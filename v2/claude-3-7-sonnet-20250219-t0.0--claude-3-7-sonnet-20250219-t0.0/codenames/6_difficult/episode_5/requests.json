The goal is to have my partner guess as many of our team's words as possible based on my clue.

Let's check if there are any other good options:\n\n\"Flight\":\n- Clearly connects to: eagle, missile\n- Might connect to: tokyo (flight to Tokyo)\n- Unlikely to connect to opponent/distractor words\n\n\"Astronomy\":\n- Clearly connects to: telescope\n- Might connect to: life (astrobiology)\n- Unlikely to connect to opponent/distractor words\n\n\"Screen\":\n- Clearly connects to: tablet, web\n- Might connect to: telescope (viewing screen)\n- Unlikely to connect to opponent/distractor words\n\nI think \"Space\" is still my best option.

Not a strong connection\n- king: not a strong connection\n- boom: not a strong connection\n- contract: Olympic contracts exist, but not a strong connection\n- pipe: not a strong connection\n- heart: Olympic spirit?

The risk with \"space\" is that it might lead to \"washington\" (as in space program) or even \"novel\" (as in \"space novel\" like science fiction).\n\n\"Technology\" is pretty good for tablet, web, missile, and telescope, but it's a bit broad.\n\n\"Science\" works for disease, missile, telescope, and life, but again might be a bit broad.\n\nI think \"digital\" for tablet and web is fairly specific and safe.\n\nLet me evaluate other options:\n- \"defense\" for missile and disease (as in defense against disease)\n- \"network\" for web and missile (missile defense network)\n- \"medicine\" for tablet and disease\n- \"research\" for disease, telescope, and life\n- \"discovery\" for disease, telescope, web, and life\n\nI think \"research\" is a good balance - it clearly connects to disease (medical research), telescope (astronomical research), and life (biological research). It's specific enough that it shouldn't lead to opponent's words or the kill word.\n\nAnother option is \"health\" for disease and life, but it might lead to \"heart\" from the opponent's words.\n\nI think I'll go with \"research\" as my clue, connecting disease, telescope, and life.\n\nActually, I just realized I could use \"internet\" to connect web and tablet quite specifically. This is probably safer and more direct than \"research\".\n\nLet's assess the options:\n1. \"research\" for disease, telescope, life\n2. \"internet\" for web, tablet\n3. \"digital\" for web, tablet\n4. \"space\" for missile, telescope\n\nI'm going to go with \"internet\" for web and tablet. It's specific, clear, and unlikely to lead to opponent's words or the kill word.\n\nWait, let me think about this one more time. I want to optimize for getting multiple words at once, while being safe.\n\nThe clue \"defense\" could work for:\n- missile (defense weapon)\n- disease (defense against disease)\n- web (web security/defense)\n\nThis could potentially get 3 words at once. But there's some risk it could lead to \"king\" (defender of the realm) or \"washington\" (defense department).\n\nI think I'll go with \"internet\" as my clue, targeting web and tablet.
