This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01VNtLrEoKAagyRFE934fSJH", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJA2VD8VagB4TAKmzl+jAz/7qDMqKvlJrKppktTDrk4CLCLnjJWO7v0JmT7zWeg4BuroTht7wrJkbcgXTxcd4ccgRIMYz9Q4dL7cFl2aBpPGgwwU55zwaexDUod5HkiMCitFB4Iae+5Etpn5OdJMBh1gAefm2+XkCqVwsqD31R7Lwqxx1VY0SAy6OO4QNPOcypQ8mPaJzI6nAdu7EJH3cnrd8d662W983VtFvOk9VaOxqLnZwd/zcqiLGTsF5DRZNOem6Gz3FUtv4LiRyxdkU02rkV7WtLHePzetJQ7+O1SqjY=", "thinking": "I'm playing Wordle, and need to make a first guess for a 5-letter English word.\n\nFor my first guess, I want to choose a common 5-letter word that has a good mix of vowels and common consonants to get information.
