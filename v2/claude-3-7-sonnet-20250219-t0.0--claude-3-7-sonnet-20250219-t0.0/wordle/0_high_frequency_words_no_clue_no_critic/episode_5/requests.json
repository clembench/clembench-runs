This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01Wtq7BeUK8zV1uU15Lvqq6R", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAvOEfBQZEdz4b5KDe+nHCi3sa8BfYrmh14SFhaM/eaG6QYUpopMGHVvpb6pxY/ih8FsZgg8OGx4hF3atV2LpS2BIMRYDkap/ZiOnL7zFcGgyiIgsyHjOdps60C/giMLhdSzNWFJuFYiNmP4dTSm19ZGpJYlhR7vgaTETSfW1SvqpDpxCnOZYFzVGFYIZQ7ypQL+sNf9BMnHMMzItVOq4Wts/evIypxOGzc6/+zYg0pSl2p/w3xBpLyy46IEeLpRuSh/+JeZ3v8pzuAM6ww+ulxw4c7Z7t4feJZZ9qQUab8LI=", "thinking": "I need to make a guess for a 5-letter English word.
