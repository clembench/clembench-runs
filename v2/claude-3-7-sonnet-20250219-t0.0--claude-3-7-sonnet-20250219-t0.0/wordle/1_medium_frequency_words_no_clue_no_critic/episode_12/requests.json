From the feedback for \"price\", 'c' was yellow, meaning it's in the word but not in that position. But now we have 'c' green in the first position. So it could be that there's only one 'c' in the word, and it belongs in the first position.\n\nSo I need a five-letter word that starts with \"cr\" and ends with \"e\". The 3rd and 4th positions are still unknown, but I know they're not 's', 't', 'a', 'p', 'i', 'u', or 'd'.\n\nPossible words could be:\n- \"crime\" (but 'i' was ruled out)\n- \"crave\" (but 'a' was ruled out)\n- \"craze\"\n- \"crane\"\n- \"crone\"\n- \"crore\"\n- \"crepe\"\n- \"creme\"\n- \"creve\"\n\nLet me eliminate more:\n- \"craze\" (has 'a', ruled out)\n- \"crane\" (has 'a', ruled out)\n- \"crone\" has 'o' and 'n', which we haven't tested yet\n- \"crore\" (has two 'r's and 'o', not sure if there are two 'r's)\n- \"crepe\" (has 'p', ruled out)\n- \"creme\" could work, it has 'm' which we haven't tested\n\nActually, let's review what we know about 'c' again. We had 'c' yellow in \"price\" (4th position) and green in \"crude\" (1st position). This suggests there's only one 'c' in the word and it's in the 1st position. So we're looking for words that start with \"cr\" and end with \"e\" and don't have a second 'c'.\n\nGiven that, \"creme\" seems like a good guess. But let me check if there are other possibilities:\n\n- \"crowe\" (has 'o' and 'w')\n- \"crake\" (has 'a', ruled out)\n- \"crave\" (has 'a', ruled out)\n- \"crome\" (has 'o' and 'm')\n- \"crope\" (has 'o' and 'p', but 'p' is ruled out)\n- \"crole\" (has 'o' and 'l')\n- \"creve\" (has two 'e's)\n\nI think \"crome\" might be a word (chrome without the 'h'), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try \"creme\" as my next guess.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. I previously thought there might be another 'c' in the word, but that's not necessarily true. From the feedback for \"price\", 'c' was yellow, meaning it's in the word but not in the 4th position. Now we know 'c' is in the 1st position (green in \"crude\"). So there's just one 'c' in the word, and it's in the 1st position.\n\nSo the pattern is \"cr__e\" and I'm looking for the 3rd and 4th letters, knowing they're not 's', 't', 'a', 'p', 'i', 'u', or 'd'.\n\nI've thought of several possibilities like \"creme\", \"crone\", \"crole\", \"creve\", etc.\n\nLet me check if \"creme\" is a valid English word.
