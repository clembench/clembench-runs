You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:32:07.830424", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a strategic word that contains common vowels (a, e) and common consonants (s, l, t) to get information about as many frequently used letters as possible.\nguess: slate"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:32:07.830981", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = pasta\nguess = slate\nguess_feedback = s<yellow> l<red> a<yellow> t<green> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:32:07.831148", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<yellow> l<red> a<yellow> t<green> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:32:15.840555", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, I know 't' is in the correct 4th position, while 's' and 'a' are in the word but in wrong positions.
