This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "msg_01TEL3vZWkqdHpk2TZ8iw2Eb", "content": [{"signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAWl76QFudiwhCMp1rXAun5Ppe7r0Ec2a7vJ2ZJtHkwTZiMry2fJpFc7V/mVNmZ+OXoDB+uUd0dcb7h9NyjGvH7BIMNZz5wwj132Y4M0XfGgwByiOjb6HuJ9+scNoiMBn41LfxVdX+it2o0FHa4IimrSBDu/xR+hFFN+d0xNy3jEpooDam0QgnaA3T2Gs/XypQ+Uwx+AySWxQwydOWRhKm/F1w+kWbMNsVDaWtwqB7ssPhpf4sfshuMcsO4HZSfaz/C3smXF43HbLpWyMFAL8pXBIluZXqfuVUv1QNh5PvgbY=", "thinking": "I need to make my first guess for a Wordle game.
