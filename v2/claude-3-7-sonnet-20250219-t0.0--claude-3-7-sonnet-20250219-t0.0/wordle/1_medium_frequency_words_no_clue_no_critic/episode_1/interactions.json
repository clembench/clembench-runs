You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:22:16.448229", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'll start with a strategic word that contains common vowels and consonants. \"STARE\" includes the common letters S, T, A, R, and E, which appear frequently in English words.\n\nguess: stare"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:22:16.448524", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guess does not conform to the format rules\nError: The response should contain only the 'guess:' and 'explanation:' keywords and associated information."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:22:16.448660", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "game_result = ABORT"}}]], "n_turns": 6, "Played turns": 1, "Complete turns": 0, "Aborted": true, "Lose": false, "Request Count": [1], "Parsed Request Count": [0], "Violated Request Count": [1], "Evaluation": {"target_word": "voila", "target_word_clue": "\"behold!\"", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "use_clue": false, "use_critic": false, "guess": [], "guess_explanation": [], "critic_feedback": {}}}
