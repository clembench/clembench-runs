	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For instance, if your guess is "apple", your response should be\\ \tt explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.

	 explanation: Based on the feedback, I know "i" is correctly in the 3rd position and both "s" and "n" are in the word but in wrong positions. Letters "a", "r", "e", "u", and "g" are not in the word. Since "s" has been yellow in positions 2 and 4, it must be in position 1 or 5. "n" can be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

	 explanation: This feedback is confusing because "i" was green in position 3 for the first two guesses but now yellow in position 2. Let me focus on what we know: "i," "s," and "n" are in the word but not in their current positions. Letters not in the word include a, r, e, u, g, h, t. Since "s" has been yellow in positions 2, 4, and 5, it's likely in position 1. Since "n" has been yellow in positions 2 and 4, it could be in position 5. I'll try "scion" which places these letters accordingly and introduces new letters "c" and "o".\\ \tt guess: scion

	 explanation: From the feedback, I now know "s" is correct in position 1 and "i" is correct in position 3. The letter "n" is in the word but not in position 5 (and based on previous feedback, not in positions 2, 3, or 4 either). This means "n" must be in position 2. Letters not in the word include a, r, e, u, g, h, t, c, o. I'll try "sniff" which places s, n, i in the correct positions and adds "f" twice as a common possibility for positions 4 and 5.\\ \tt guess: sniff
