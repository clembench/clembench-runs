There are two complete columns of X's on the right side (the rightmost columns)\n2.

So it doesn't have a solid column of X's on the rightmost column. The fourth column (second from right) does have all X's. But the requirement is two solid columns on the right side, which isn't met. Also, the bottom left corner (rows 4-5, columns 1-2) has empty spaces, which matches that part of the description.\n\nSecond Grid:\n```\nX □ □ X X\nX □ □ X X\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ X X\n□ □ □ X X\n```\nLooking at the right side, the rightmost column and the second-from-right column are both filled with X's in all rows. So this has two solid columns of X's on the right side. The bottom left corner (rows 4-5, columns 1-2) has empty spaces. This grid seems to match the description.\n\nThird Grid:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ X\nX X X X X\n```\nLooking at the right side, the rightmost column has X's in rows 1, 3, 4, and 5, but an empty space in row 2. So it doesn't have a solid column of X's on the rightmost column. The bottom left corner has X's in row 4, column 1, so it doesn't have empty spaces throughout the bottom left.\n\nBased on this analysis, the second grid matches the referring expression: it has two solid columns of X's on the right side and empty spaces in the bottom left corner.\n\nSo the answer is the second grid.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "Answer: second", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 314, "output_tokens": 563}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 18:51:56.243450", "call_duration": "0:00:08.570375", "response": "Answer: second", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}]
