Let me analyze all three grids to identify the key differences.\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX X X X □\n□ □ □ X □\nX X X X □\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n```\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ X □\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ X □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ X\nX X X X X\n```\n\nKey differences I notice:\n\n1. In the target grid, the top right corner (position (0,4)) is empty (□), while in both distractors it's filled (X).\n\n2. In the target grid, the bottom row pattern is all filled (X X X X X), which matches distractor 1, but differs from distractor 2.\n\n3. In the target grid, the first cell of row 2 (position (1,0)) is empty (□), which matches distractor 1 but differs from distractor 2 where it's filled.\n\n4. The target grid has an empty cell at position (3,4) in the fourth row, while distractor 1 has a filled cell there and distractor 2 has a filled cell there.\n\n5. The target grid has a filled cell at position (3,0) in the fourth row (left edge), while distractor 1 has an empty cell there and distractor 2 has a filled cell there.\n\nTo create a unique description, I should focus on patterns that are exclusive to the target grid. Let me try to identify such patterns:\n\n- The target grid has an empty cell in the top-right corner (the first row ends with an empty cell)\n- The target grid has a row pattern in the fourth row that's unique: X □ □ □ □ (filled cell on the far left, rest empty)\n- The target grid is the only one where the first column has a gap (the second row starts with an empty cell)\n\nI think a good referring expression would mention these distinctive features. Let me draft a few options:\n\nOption 1: \"Grid with an empty cell in the top-right corner and a mostly empty fourth row except for the leftmost cell.\"\n\nOption 2: \"Grid where the first row ends with an empty cell and the bottom row is completely filled.\"\n\nOption 3: \"Grid with an empty top-right corner and where the fourth row from the top has only one X on the left.\"\n\nI think Option 3 is the most precise and distinctive. Let me make sure it truly distinguishes the target from both distractors:\n\nTop-right corner: \n- Target: Empty (□)\n- Distractor 1: Filled (X)\n- Distractor 2: Filled (X)\n✓ This distinguishes the target from both distractors.\n\nFourth row pattern (X □ □ □ □):\n- Target: Has this exact pattern\n- Distractor 1: Has pattern □ □ □ X □\n- Distractor 2: Has pattern X □ □ □ X\n✓ This further distinguishes the target from both distractors.\n\nI believe this description is sufficiently distinctive. Let me finalize the referring expression.\n\nActually, let me consider if there are any other unique patterns in the target grid that might be easier to describe:\n\nThe target has empty cells at the end of three consecutive rows (rows 1, 2, and 3), which is unique. \n\nI think I'll go with: \"Grid with empty cells at the right end of the top three rows and a fourth row that has only one X on the left side.\"\n\nLet me verify this is distinctive:\n- Empty cells at right end of top three rows: Only true for target\n- Fourth row with only one X on left: Only true for target\n\nYes, this is distinctive and precise.
