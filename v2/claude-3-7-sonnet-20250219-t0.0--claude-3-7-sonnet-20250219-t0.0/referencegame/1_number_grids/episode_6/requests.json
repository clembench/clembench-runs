It has a solid middle row (row 3) that is all Xs\n2. The right side (columns 4-5) has all Xs\n3. The top-left has Xs in column 1, rows 1-3\n4. The bottom-left (rows 4-5, columns 1-3) is all empty\n5. The top-middle (rows 1-2, columns 2-3) is all empty\n\nComparing with distractor grid 1:\n- Distractor 1 has a pattern of alternating full rows (rows 1, 3, 5 are all Xs)\n- Distractor 1 has column 4 mostly filled but not completely\n- The right corner (row 2, column 5) is empty in distractor 1 but filled in target\n\nComparing with distractor grid 2:\n- Distractor 2 has full rows 1, 3, 5 (similar to distractor 1)\n- Distractor 2 has column 1 completely filled, unlike target\n- Distractor 2 has different empty space patterns\n\nUnique features of target grid:\n1. The right side (columns 4-5) is completely filled with Xs\n2. The bottom-left corner (rows 4-5, columns 1-3) is completely empty\n3. The pattern forms a kind of \"L\" shape with filled cells\n\nLet me craft a clear and concise referring expression that captures these distinguishing features:\n\n\"The grid with Xs forming an L-shape, where the entire right side is filled and the bottom-left corner is empty.\"\n\nThis describes the key visual pattern (L-shape) and mentions the two most distinctive features (filled right side, empty bottom-left).\n\nLet me verify this would uniquely identify the target:\n- Distractor 1 doesn't have a completely filled right side and doesn't have an empty bottom-left corner\n- Distractor 2 doesn't have the L-shape pattern and doesn't have an empty bottom-left corner\n\nActually, let me look more carefully at the specific pattern. I think it's more of a backwards \"Γ\" shape (gamma) than an L. Let me refine my description:\n\n\"The grid where the right two columns are all Xs, and the left column has Xs only in the top three rows, with the bottom-left 3x2 area completely empty.\"\n\nThis is very specific but maybe a bit wordy. Let me try again:\n\n\"The grid with Xs forming a backwards L-shape, with the right side completely filled and the bottom-left corner empty.\"\n\nOne more attempt:\n\n\"The grid where the entire right side is filled with Xs, forming a shape like a backwards 'L' with the bottom-left quadrant empty.\"\n\nI think this captures the distinctive features well. I'll go with this one.\n\nActually, looking again, I think the pattern is more like a \"7\" rotated 90 degrees clockwise, with the top-middle area empty and the bottom-left area empty.\n\nLet me try one more description:\n\n\"The grid where the right two columns are all Xs, the left column has Xs only in the top three rows, and both the top-middle and bottom-left areas are empty.\"\n\nThis is detailed but captures all the key distinctive features.
