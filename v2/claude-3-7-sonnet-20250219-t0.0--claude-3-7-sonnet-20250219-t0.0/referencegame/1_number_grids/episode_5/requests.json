First row:\n   - Target: X X X X X (all filled)\n   - Distractor 1: X X X X □ (rightmost cell is empty)\n   - Distractor 2: X X X X X (all filled, same as target)\n\n2. Second row:\n   - Target: □ □ □ X □ (only 4th cell filled)\n   - Distractor 1: □ □ □ X □ (only 4th cell filled, same as target)\n   - Distractor 2: X □ □ □ □ (only 1st cell filled, different from target)\n\n3. Third row:\n   - Target: X X X X X (all filled)\n   - Distractor 1: X X X X □ (rightmost cell is empty)\n   - Distractor 2: X X X X □ (rightmost cell is empty)\n\n4. Fourth row:\n   - Target: □ □ □ X □ (only 4th cell filled)\n   - Distractor 1: X □ □ □ □ (only 1st cell filled, different from target)\n   - Distractor 2: □ □ □ X □ (only 4th cell filled, same as target)\n\n5. Fifth row:\n   - Target: X X X X X (all filled)\n   - Distractor 1: X X X X X (all filled, same as target)\n   - Distractor 2: X X X X □ (rightmost cell is empty)\n\nKey distinguishing features for the target grid:\n1. It has three completely filled rows (rows 1, 3, and 5)\n2. The 4th column is completely filled (all X's)\n3. The pattern alternates between full rows and rows with only the 4th cell filled\n\nLooking at these patterns, I can see that the target grid has a very specific structure: it has three horizontal lines (rows 1, 3, and 5 all filled) with a vertical line in the 4th column connecting them. This creates a pattern that looks like the letter \"E\" rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nBoth distractor grids have incomplete top, middle, or bottom rows, breaking this \"E\" pattern.\n\nLet me craft a referring expression that captures this unique pattern:\n\n\"The grid with three complete horizontal lines connected by a vertical line in the fourth column\"\n\nOr alternatively:\n\"The grid that looks like a sideways letter E with the vertical line on the right side\"\n\nEither of these should uniquely identify the target grid. I think the first one is more precise and descriptive, so I'll go with that.\n\nActually, let me double-check my analysis to make sure I haven't missed anything:\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ X □\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ X □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nYes, it has:\n- 3 complete rows (1, 3, 5)\n- A vertical line in column 4\n- Rows 2 and 4 have only a single X in column 4\n\nThis indeed looks like a rotated \"E\" with the back of the E on the right.\n\nLet's finalize this expression:\n\"The grid that looks like the letter E rotated 90 degrees clockwise\"\n\nOr more descriptively:\n\"The grid with three full horizontal lines (rows 1, 3, and 5) connected by a vertical line in the fourth column\"\n\nI think either of these would work well, but the second one is more precise and doesn't rely on the interpretation of what a rotated E looks like.
