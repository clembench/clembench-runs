Let me analyze all three grids:\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 1:\n```\nX X X X X\nX X □ □ □\nX X X X X\nX X □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nDistractor grid 2:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\n```\n\nLet me identify the key differences and unique features of the target grid:\n\n1. In the target grid, the first column and the top and bottom rows are completely filled with X's, forming a kind of \"frame\" or \"border\" on three sides.\n2. The rest of the grid (the inner part) is completely empty.\n\nDistractor grid 1 has X's filling the left two columns and all X's in the top, middle, and bottom rows, creating a kind of \"E\" shape.\n\nDistractor grid 2 has X's in the top row, partially in the third row, and in the first column, but the bottom row is not completely filled with X's like in the target grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I can create a referring expression for the target grid:\n\nThe grid has a border of X's on the left side, top, and bottom, with the rest of the grid being empty.\n\nOr, another way to describe it:\nThe grid has X's forming a U-shape along the left, top, and bottom, with all other cells being empty.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is that the target grid has complete rows of X's only in the first (top) and fifth (bottom) rows, while distractor grid 1 has complete rows of X's in the first, third, and fifth rows.\n\nI think the most concise and distinctive description would be something like:\n\n\"The grid with X's forming a U-shape (left column, top row, and bottom row), with the rest being empty.\"\n\nLet me check if this description uniquely identifies the target grid:\n- Target grid: Yes, it has X's forming a U-shape along the left, top, and bottom.\n- Distractor grid 1: No, it has more X's than just the U-shape.\n- Distractor grid 2: No, it doesn't have a complete row of X's at the bottom.\n\nSo this description should be sufficient to uniquely identify the target grid.\n\nThe target grid has a structure that resembles a \"U\" shape, with the left side, top, and bottom filled with X's, while the rest is empty. \n\nSo my referring expression will be:\n\"The grid with X's forming a U-shape (left column, top row, and bottom row), with the rest being empty.\"\n\nActually, to be a bit more concise, I'll just say:\n\"The grid with X's forming a U-shape.\"\n\nActually, I'm noticing that \"U-shape\" might be a bit subjective. Let me be more precise:\n\n\"The grid with X's in the first column, top row, and bottom row only.\"\n\nThis should uniquely identify the target grid.\n\nWait, I need to make sure that this is fully accurate. Let me verify again:\n\nTarget grid:\n```\nX X X X X\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\n\nThe target grid has:\n- First column: All X's\n- Top row: All X's\n- Bottom row: All X's\n- Everything else: Empty\n\nBut wait, I'm noticing an issue. The first row has X's in all positions, including the first column. Similarly, the fifth row also has X's in all positions. So it's not exactly \"first column, top row, and bottom row only\" because that would mean the X in the top-left and bottom-left would be counted twice.\n\nLet me rephrase to be more accurate:\n\n\"The grid with X's forming a rectangular border on the left, top, and bottom, with the right side open.\"\n\nActually, I think I should just be very explicit about the pattern:\n\n\"The grid with X's in the top row, bottom row, and left column, forming a U-shape, with all other cells empty.\"\n\nThis should be clear and unambiguous.\n\nLet me provide the final answer with the requested format, starting with \"Expression:\":\n\n\"Expression: The grid with X's in the top row, bottom row, and left column, forming a U-shape, with all other cells empty.\"\n\nActually let me try to make it a bit more concise:\n\n\"Expression: The grid with X's forming a U-shape, with X's in the top row, bottom row, and left column, and all other cells empty.\"\n\nI think we can simplify further:\n\n\"Expression: The grid with X's forming a U-shape on the left, top, and bottom, with the rest being empty.\"\n\nWait a moment, I think the following would be even more concise:\n\n\"Expression: Grid with X's in a U-shape (left column, top and bottom rows).\"\n\nActually, I just realized that the question states to \"Describe the target grid,\" and my task is to generate a referring expression.
