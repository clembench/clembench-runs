Pattern/Symmetry: The target grid appears to have a symmetrical pattern, with empty cells forming a diamond or X shape. The corners (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), and (5,5) are all empty.\n\n2. Number of empty cells: The target grid has 9 empty cells. Let me count the empty cells in the distractor grids:\n   - Distractor 1: It appears to have 5 empty cells\n   - Distractor 2: It has more empty cells, especially concentrated in the middle and bottom rows\n\n3. Distribution of empty cells: \n   - Target: Empty cells form a pattern - corners are empty and there's a diagonal-like pattern of empty cells\n   - Distractor 1: Fewer empty cells, more scattered\n   - Distractor 2: Empty cells are clustered in the middle to lower part of the grid\n\nThe most distinctive feature seems to be the symmetrical pattern in the target grid where:\n- All four corners are empty (□)\n- There's a pattern where empty cells form a kind of X or diamond shape\n- The empty cells are distributed symmetrically\n\nI'll create a referring expression that highlights these distinctive features.\n\nI think the most salient feature of the target grid is that it has empty corners and has a symmetrical pattern with empty cells forming a diamond or X shape.\n\nMy referring expression:\n\"The grid with all four corners empty and empty cells forming a diamond pattern\"\n\nThis should distinguish it clearly from both distractors because:\n- Distractor 1 doesn't have empty corners\n- Distractor 2 doesn't have the diamond pattern of empty cells\n\nAfter double-checking, I notice that the target grid has a specific pattern where the empty cells form a sort of X shape (or diamond).
