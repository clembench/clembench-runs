Pattern/arrangement:\n   - Target grid: Has more empty spaces, especially in the middle and top-right\n   - Distractor 1: Very dense with X, few empty spaces\n   - Distractor 2: Has a concentration of empty spaces in the middle-left\n\n3. First row:\n   - Target: X □ X □ □ (3 empty cells)\n   - Distractor 1: X □ X X X (1 empty cell)\n   - Distractor 2: X X X X X (no empty cells)\n\n4. Specific distinguishing features of the target:\n   - Has a column of Xs on the left edge (except position (4,1))\n   - Has more scattered/isolated Xs\n   - Has a pattern of empty cells in the middle\n   - The bottom-right corner is filled with Xs\n\nI think a good referring expression would focus on:\n1.
