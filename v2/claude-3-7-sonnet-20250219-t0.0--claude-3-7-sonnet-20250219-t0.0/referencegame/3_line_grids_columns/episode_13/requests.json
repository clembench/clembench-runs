The fourth position from the left is column 4.\n\n- Grid 1: Column 4 is empty (□)\n- Grid 2: Column 4 is empty (□)\n- Grid 3: Column 4 is filled with X\n\nSo both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position from the left.\n\nWait, let me double-check this. The fourth column (counting from the left) would be:\n- Grid 1: Column 4 is [□, □, □, □, □] - completely empty\n- Grid 2: Column 4 is [□, □, □, □, □] - completely empty\n- Grid 3: Column 4 is [X, X, X, X, X] - completely filled\n\nSo both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position.\n\nHowever, I need to select a single grid. Since the description is ambiguous between Grid 1 and Grid 2, I should look for other distinguishing features.\n\nActually, I realize I may have misunderstood the task. The expression specifically refers to \"the grid with an empty column in the fourth position from the left.\" This suggests there is only one grid that matches this description.\n\nLet me re-examine the grids.\n\nGrid 1:\n```\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\n```\n\nColumn 4 is empty (all □).\n\nGrid 2:\n```\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\n```\n\nColumn 4 is empty (all □).\n\nGrid 3:\n```\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n```\n\nColumn 4 is filled (all X).\n\nBoth Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position from the left. \n\nLet me check again to make sure I'm not missing something. The expression is \"The grid with an empty column in the fourth position from the left.\"\n\nHmm, maybe I need to be more precise about what columns are empty in each grid:\n\nGrid 1:\n- Column 1: filled (all X)\n- Column 2: filled (all X)\n- Column 3: filled (all X)\n- Column 4: empty (all □)\n- Column 5: empty (all □)\n\nGrid 2:\n- Column 1: filled (all X)\n- Column 2: filled (all X)\n- Column 3: filled (all X)\n- Column 4: empty (all □)\n- Column 5: filled (all X)\n\nGrid 3:\n- Column 1: empty (all □)\n- Column 2: filled (all X)\n- Column 3: filled (all X)\n- Column 4: filled (all X)\n- Column 5: filled (all X)\n\nBoth Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position from the left.\n\nLet me re-read the expression carefully once more: \"The grid with an empty column in the fourth position from the left.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as \"Find the grid that has its fourth column empty.\" If that's the case, both Grid 1 and Grid 2 qualify.\n\nHowever, the article \"the\" in \"the grid\" implies that only one grid satisfies the condition. Since both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty fourth column, there must be another factor I'm missing to distinguish between them.\n\nLet's assume the expression is complete and I need to choose between Grid 1 and Grid 2. In this case, I would need to select the one that most uniquely fits the description.\n\nGrid 1 has two empty columns (4 and 5), while Grid 2 has only one empty column (4). Since Grid 2 uniquely has exactly one empty column, and that column is in the fourth position, Grid 2 might be a more specific match for the expression.\n\nHowever, the expression doesn't specify anything about other columns, so this reasoning might be flawed.\n\nSince both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position from the left, and there doesn't seem to be any other distinguishing factor in the expression, I believe both could be considered correct. However, if I must choose one, I'll go with Grid 2 as it has exactly the feature described and nothing more (i.e., just one empty column, which is in the fourth position).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider this. The expression doesn't say \"a grid with an empty column in the fourth position\" - it says \"THE grid with an empty column in the fourth position.\" This means there should be exactly one grid that fits this description.\n\nSince both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have empty fourth columns, something else in the expression must distinguish between them. But I don't see anything else in the expression that would help distinguish between them.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what \"fourth position from the left\" means. If we start counting from 0 (like in some programming contexts), then the fourth position would actually be column 5. But even in that case, Grid 1 would have an empty column in this position, while Grid 2 would not.\n\nI think I've exhausted all interpretations of the expression, and I'm still left with the conclusion that both Grid 1 and Grid 2 could match the description. In this case, I'll have to make a judgment call and choose the one that seems to most specifically match the description. That would be Grid 2, which has exactly one empty column, and that column is in the fourth position from the left.\n\nHowever, I notice that I may have misunderstood the grid representation. Let me ensure I understand the symbols correctly:\n\n- \"X\" represents a filled cell\n- \"□\" represents an empty cell\n\nSo I'm looking for a grid where the entire fourth column consists of empty cells (□).\n\nGrid 1:\n```\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\nX X X □ □\n```\n\nIn Grid 1, the fourth column is all □, which means it's empty.\n\nGrid 2:\n```\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\nX X X □ X\n```\n\nIn Grid 2, the fourth column is also all □, which means it's empty.\n\nGrid 3:\n```\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n□ X X X X\n```\n\nIn Grid 3, the fourth column is all X, which means it's filled.\n\nSo, both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty fourth column. Let me try one more time to see if there's any hint in the expression that would help distinguish between them...\n\nI don't see any additional clues in the expression. Given that both Grid 1 and Grid 2 have an empty column in the fourth position from the left, I will have to make a judgment call.
