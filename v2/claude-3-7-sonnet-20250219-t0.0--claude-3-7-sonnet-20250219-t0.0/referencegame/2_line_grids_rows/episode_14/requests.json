Specifically, columns 1, 3, and 5 are filled with X, while columns 2 and 4 are empty. The pattern is consistent across all rows. This creates vertical stripes of filled and empty cells.\n\n**Distractor Grid 1**:\n```\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n□ □ X X X\n```\nThis has columns 1 and 2 completely empty, and columns 3, 4, and 5 completely filled with X. This creates a grid that's vertically split with the left part empty and the right part filled.\n\n**Distractor Grid 2**:\n```\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n□ □ □ □ □\nX X X X X\n```\nThis has rows 1, 3, and 5 completely filled with X, and rows 2 and 4 completely empty.

The target grid has its first column filled, unlike Distractor 1.\n4. The target grid has every other column filled, while Distractor 1 has consecutive columns filled.\n\nI think the most distinctive feature is the alternating pattern of filled and empty columns.
