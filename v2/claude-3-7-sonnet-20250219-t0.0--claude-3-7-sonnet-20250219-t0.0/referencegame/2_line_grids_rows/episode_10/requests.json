The pattern is consistent across all five rows.\n\nNow, let me identify what makes the target grid unique:\n\n1. The target grid has two consecutive empty columns on the left side, followed by three consecutive filled columns on the right side.\n2. The target grid has all its empty cells clustered on the left side.\n3. The target grid has a clear division between empty and filled regions.\n\nComparing to distractor 1: Both have 3 filled columns and 2 empty columns, but in the target, the empty columns are adjacent and on the left side, while in distractor 1, they're on the outer edges.\n\nComparing to distractor 2: The target has a solid block of filled cells, while distractor 2 has alternating filled and empty cells creating a striped pattern.\n\nBased on these distinctions, here are some potential referring expressions:\n\n1. \"The grid with the first two columns empty and the rest filled.\"\n2. \"The grid where all empty cells are on the left side.\"\n3. \"The grid with two empty columns on the left and three filled columns on the right.\"\n4. \"The grid with a clear left-to-right division between empty and filled cells.\"\n5. \"The grid with all filled cells forming a single connected block on the right side.\"\n\nI think the most distinctive and concise description would be: \"The grid with two empty columns on the left and three filled columns on the right.\"\n\nLet me check if this uniquely identifies the target:\n- It distinguishes from distractor 1, which has empty columns on both the leftmost and rightmost sides.\n- It distinguishes from distractor 2, which has alternating filled and empty columns.\n\nYes, this description uniquely identifies the target grid.
