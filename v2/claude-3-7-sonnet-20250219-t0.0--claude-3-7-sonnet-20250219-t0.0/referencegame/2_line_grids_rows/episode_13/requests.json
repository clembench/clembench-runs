Let me look at the patterns:\n\n1. Target grid: It has alternating X and empty cells in each row (columns 1, 3, 5 are filled with X, and columns 2, 4 are empty). This creates a vertical stripe pattern where every other column is filled. The pattern is consistent across all rows.\n\n2. Distractor grid 1: The first two columns are empty, and the last three columns are filled with X. This creates a split where the left 40% is empty and the right 60% is filled.\n\n3. Distractor grid 2: It has a horizontal stripe pattern with rows 1, 3, and 5 completely filled with X and rows 2 and 4 completely empty.\n\nThe key differences:\n- The target grid has a vertical stripe pattern (alternating columns)\n- Distractor 1 has a vertical split (left empty, right filled)\n- Distractor 2 has a horizontal stripe pattern (alternating rows)\n\nA good referring expression should highlight these distinguishing features. Let me create an expression that clearly identifies the target grid:\n\nExpression: The grid with alternating filled and empty columns, creating vertical stripes\n\nActually, I can be even more precise:\n\nExpression: The grid where columns 1, 3, and 5 are filled with X and columns 2 and 4 are empty\n\nOr I could describe it as:\n\nExpression: The grid with vertical stripes where every other column is filled\n\nAny of these would uniquely identify the target grid.
