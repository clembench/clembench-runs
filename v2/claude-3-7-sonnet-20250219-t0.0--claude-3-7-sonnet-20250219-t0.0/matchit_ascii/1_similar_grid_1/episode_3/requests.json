First row has all X's. First column has all X's. Top-left 3x3 corner is filled with X's, except for positions (2,2) and (2,3) which are squares. All remaining positions contain squares.\"\n\nAnd visually I was given:\n```\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n```\n\nLooking at this grid, I see the bottom row (row 5) has X only in position (5,1) and squares in all other positions. This is different from what the other person described (X's in all positions of row 5).\n\nTherefore, our grids are different.\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the numbering system. Let me check again.\n\nWhen I say \"row 1\", it's the topmost row. \"Row 5\" is the bottom row.\nWhen I say column 1, it's the leftmost column.\n\nSo in my grid:\n- Row 1: X X X X X (all X's)\n- Row 2: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ (X in position 1, squares elsewhere)\n- Row 3: X X X ▢ ▢ (X's in positions 1, 2, 3, squares in 4, 5)\n- Row 4: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ (X in position 1, squares elsewhere)\n- Row 5: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ (X in position 1, squares elsewhere)\n\nThe other person described:\n- Row 1: X X X X X (all X's) - Matches\n- Row 2: Not explicitly described in full, but we confirmed X only in position (2,1) - Matches\n- Row 3: X's in positions 1, 2, and 3 - Matches\n- Row 4: Not explicitly described in full, but we confirmed X only in position (4,1) - Matches\n- Row 5: X in all 5 positions - Does NOT match (my grid has X only in position (5,1))\n\nSo our grids seem to differ in the bottom row (row 5).\n\nBut wait, there seems to be a contradiction. The other person initially described: \"The bottom row (row 5) has X in all 5 positions.\" But when I asked \"Does your grid have X's in all positions of the bottom row (row 5)?\", they answered \"Yes.\"\n\nLet me double-check my grid's bottom row to make absolutely sure:\n```\nX X X X X\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX X X ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nX ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n```\n\nThe bottom row (row 5) in my grid is: X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n\nThis does not match their description of \"X in all 5 positions\" for the bottom row.\n\nWait, I made an error. I need to check their initial description again. They said:\n\"I see a 5x5 grid. The leftmost column has X in all 5 positions. Row 3 has X's in positions 1, 2, and 3. The bottom row (row 5) has X in all 5 positions. All other positions contain empty squares.\"\n\nSo according to them:\n- First column: All X's - Matches my grid\n- Row 3: X's in positions 1, 2, and 3 - Matches my grid\n- Row 5 (bottom row): All X's - Does NOT match my grid\n- All other positions: Empty squares\n\nBut then I asked \"Does your grid have X's in all positions of the bottom row (row 5)?\" and they answered \"Yes.\"\n\nSo our grids differ in row 5. In my grid, row 5 has X only in position (5,1) and squares elsewhere, while in their grid, row 5 has X's in all positions.\n\nActually, let me look back at what they initially said about row 5 carefully:\n\"The bottom row (row 5) has X in all 5 positions.\"\n\nThat clearly indicates their bottom row is all X's, whereas mine is not.
