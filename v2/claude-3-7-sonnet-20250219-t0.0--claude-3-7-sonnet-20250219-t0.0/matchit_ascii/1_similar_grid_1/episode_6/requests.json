This position is empty (no X) in my grid.\n- The other person said they have an X at position (2,4), which means row 2, column 4.\n\nSo based on this discrepancy, our grids are different.", "type": "thinking"}, {"citations": null, "text": "DECISION: different grids", "type": "text"}], "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", "role": "assistant", "stop_reason": "end_turn", "stop_sequence": null, "type": "message", "usage": {"cache_creation_input_tokens": 0, "cache_read_input_tokens": 0, "input_tokens": 731, "output_tokens": 424}, "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 20:18:00.874968", "call_duration": "0:00:07.273113", "response": "DECISION: different grids", "model_name": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"}}}]
