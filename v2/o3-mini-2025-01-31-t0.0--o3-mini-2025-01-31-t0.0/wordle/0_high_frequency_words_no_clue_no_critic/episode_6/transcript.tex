	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "explanation:" and "guess:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For instance, if your guess is "apple", your response should be\\ \tt explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Do not generate any other text.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.

Also, t is confirmed (from “store”) but not in position 2, so t must be in either position 1 or 4. Checking letters to avoid (c, a, n, i, f, l, s, o) and available options, a candidate fitting the pattern _ _ r _ e is "tyree" (T, Y, R, E, E), which places t in position 1, r in position 3, and e in positions 4 and 5. The feedback from all previous guesses matches this arrangement.\\ \tt guess: tyree

Excluding letters C, A, N, I, F, L, S, O from previous feedback leaves few options; among them, "wurte" (W, U, R, T, E) meets the pattern and letter constraints.\\ \tt guess: wurte
