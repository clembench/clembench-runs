You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:58:39.581243", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I am starting with \"crane\" because it is a common five-letter word that includes a variety of vowels and consonants.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:58:39.581652", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = infer\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:58:39.581811", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:58:51.486012", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that r, n, and e are in the target word but not in their respective positions (r not in position 2, n not in position 4, and e not in position 5).
