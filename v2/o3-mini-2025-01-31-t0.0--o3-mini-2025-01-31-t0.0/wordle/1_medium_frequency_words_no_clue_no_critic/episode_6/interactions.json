This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:56:45.142996", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: starting with a common word like \"crane\" covers several frequently used vowels and consonants, which may give us valuable feedback.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:56:45.143410", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = linen\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:56:45.143573", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:56:50.794658", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: the feedback indicates that \"n\" and \"e\" are in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, while \"c\", \"r\", and \"a\" are not present at all.
