You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:02:55.113207", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: I'm using \"crane\" as my first guess because it includes common vowels and consonants, which should give me a good spread of letters to evaluate.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:02:55.113597", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = imply\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:02:55.113756", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:01.042051", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: All letters from \"crane\" are ruled out, so I'm choosing \"blimp\" which doesn't include any of c, r, a, n, or e and introduces new letters to gather further clues.\nguess: blimp"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:01.042431", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = imply\nguess = blimp\nguess_feedback = b<red> l<yellow> i<yellow> m<yellow> p<yellow>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:01.042590", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> i<yellow> m<yellow> p<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:06.566631", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The feedback indicates that l, i, m, and p are in the word but in different positions; I've rearranged them by using \"limps\" and added a new letter \"s\" to complete the five-letter word.\nguess: limps"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:06.567141", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 3\ntarget_word = imply\nguess = limps\nguess_feedback = l<yellow> i<yellow> m<yellow> p<yellow> s<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:06.567300", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: l<yellow> i<yellow> m<yellow> p<yellow> s<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:03:35.705353", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Based on the feedback, we know that L, I, M, and P are in the word but in different positions than in \"limps\".
