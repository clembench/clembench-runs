The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\nPlease respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nexplanation: your reason for doing so\nagreement: yes or no\n\nPlease note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nclue: witch\nexplanation: The clue is \"witch,\" so I'll start by guessing the word \"witch\" since it is directly related and adheres to the 5-letter rule.\nguess: witch"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: the guess \"witch\" fits the clue directly and satisfies the 5-letter condition  \nagreement: yes"}, {"role": "user", "content": "clue: witch\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that letter \"c\" must appear in the word but not in the 4th position. \"Coven\" relates to witches, places \"c\" in the 1st position, and avoids forbidden letters.\nguess: coven\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nagreement: yes or no"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "explanation: the guess \"coven\" clearly connects to the clue \"witch\" by representing a group of witches and places \"c\" in a valid position according to the feedback  \nagreement: yes"}, {"role": "user", "content": "clue: witch\nexplanation: The feedback confirms that \"c\" is correct in position 1 and that the letters \"o\", \"e\", and \"n\" must appear, though in different spots; since \"v\" is not in the word, rearranging these letters along with a new letter leads us to \"clone\", which fits the letter constraints.\nguess: clone\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nagreement: yes or no"}], "raw_response_obj": {"id": "chatcmpl-B4uXRv9Sofu9tT1RmHwBRsVjawQSL", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "explanation: while \"clone\" meets the letter constraints, it does not have a clear connection to the clue \"witch\"  \nagreement: no", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null, "refusal": null}}], "created": 1740510345, "model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_42bfad963b", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1256, "prompt_tokens": 616, "total_tokens": 1872, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 1216, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-25 19:05:45.704741", "call_duration": "0:00:10.441760", "response": "explanation: while \"clone\" meets the letter constraints, it does not have a clear connection to the clue \"witch\"  \nagreement: no", "model_name": "o3-mini-2025-01-31"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-02-25T19:06:04.786451", "manipulated_prompt_obj": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\nguess: apple\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1.
