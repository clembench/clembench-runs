You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:57:40.390926", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common five-letter word to gather initial feedback.\nguess: crate"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:57:40.391336", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = until\nguess = crate\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> t<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:57:40.391497", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> t<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:57:42.461329", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter 't' is correct but misplaced.
