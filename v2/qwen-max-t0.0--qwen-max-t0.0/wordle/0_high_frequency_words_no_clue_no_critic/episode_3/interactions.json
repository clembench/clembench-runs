You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:19.259115", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:19.259469", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = month\nguess = apple\nguess_feedback = a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:19.259628", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:21.380909", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: All letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, so I will try a completely different set of letters. \"crane\" is a good candidate as it contains distinct letters and is a valid English word.\nguess: crane"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:21.381363", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 2\ntarget_word = month\nguess = crane\nguess_feedback = c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<red>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:21.381530", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T08:56:24.227872", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter \"n\" is correct but in the wrong position.
