Please use the tags \"explanation:\" and \"guess:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\nguess: apple\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that has a good balance of vowels and consonants, increasing the chances of getting at least one letter correct.\nguess: house<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<green> u<red> s<red> e<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"o\" is in the correct position and \"h\" is in the word but not in the correct position, while \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are not in the word. My next guess will try to utilize this information by keeping \"o\" in the same position and \"h\" in the word, and introducing new letters.\nguess: hoard<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<green> a<red> r<red> d<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback shows that \"o\" remains in the correct position, and \"h\" is still in the word but not correctly placed. The letters \"a\", \"r\", and \"d\" are not in the word. My next guess will maintain \"o\" in its position and \"h\" in the word, and will introduce new letters to replace \"a\", \"r\", and \"d\".\nguess: hooky<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<green> o<red> k<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback confirms \"o\" is in the correct position and \"h\" is in the word but not in the right place. It also introduces a new constraint with the second \"o\" being incorrect, suggesting the word might not have repeated letters or the second \"o\" is not in the correct position. My next guess will keep \"o\" in its correct position, \"h\" in the word, and try new letters.\nguess: hoist<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<green> i<red> s<red> t<yellow>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback indicates that \"o\" remains in the correct position, \"h\" is still in the word but not correctly placed, and \"t\" is in the word but not in the correct position. The letters \"i\" and \"s\" are not in the word. My next guess will maintain \"o\" and \"t\" in the word, utilize \"h\" in a different position, and introduce new letters to replace \"i\" and \"s\".\nguess: hot", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-02-24 19:42:01.003729", "call_duration": "0:00:11.600036", "response": "explanation: The feedback indicates that \"o\" remains in the correct position, \"h\" is still in the word but not correctly placed, and \"t\" is in the word but not in the correct position.
