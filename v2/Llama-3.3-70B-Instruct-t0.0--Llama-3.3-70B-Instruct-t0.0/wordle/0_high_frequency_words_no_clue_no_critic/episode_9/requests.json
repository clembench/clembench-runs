My next guess will retain \"u\" and \"s\", try them in different positions, and introduce new letters that are commonly used in many words.\nguess: bushy<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> u<yellow> s<yellow> h<red> y<red>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nexplanation: The feedback confirms that \"b\", \"h\", and \"y\" are incorrect, and \"u\" and \"s\" are still in the word but not in the right positions.
