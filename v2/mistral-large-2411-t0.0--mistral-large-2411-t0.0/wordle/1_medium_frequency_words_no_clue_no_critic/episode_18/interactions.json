You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:42:30.638629", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: Starting with a common five-letter word \"arise\" that has a good mix of vowels and consonants.\nguess: arise"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:42:30.639019", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = verve\nguess = arise\nguess_feedback = a<red> r<yellow> i<red> s<red> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:42:30.639177", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> r<yellow> i<red> s<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nexplanation: details\nguess: word"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-25T11:42:32.147443", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "explanation: The letter 'e' is in the correct spot.
