One is a purple plus sign, one is a pink letter "T" with a pink letter "P" on top of it, and three are orange shapes that look like a backwards "L", a backwards "L" with a square on top, and a backwards "L" with a square on top and a square on the right side of the top square. The purple plus sign is to the left of the pink "T" and "P", and the orange shapes are below the pink "T" and "P". The orange shapes are all connected to each other. The green shapes are to the right of the purple plus sign. There are three green shapes, and they are all connected to each other. The top green shape is a square, the middle green shape is a rectangle, and the bottom green shape is a square. The green shapes are stacked on top of each other.
