The orange shape is a backwards L on top of a rectangle. The green shape is made of three pieces. The top piece is a rectangle, the middle piece is a backwards L, and the bottom piece is a rectangle. The green shape is to the right of the purple plus sign. The pink letter P is to the right of the green shape. The pink letter T is below the pink letter P. The orange shape is below the green shape.
