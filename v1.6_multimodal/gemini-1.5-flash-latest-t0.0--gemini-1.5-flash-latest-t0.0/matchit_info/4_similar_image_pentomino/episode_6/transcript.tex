The orange shape is a backwards L on top of a rectangle. The green shape is made of three rectangles. The top rectangle is on top of the middle rectangle, and the bottom rectangle is to the right of the middle rectangle. The green shape is to the left of the purple plus sign. The pink letter P is to the right of the green shape. The pink letter T is below the pink letter P. The orange shape is below the green shape.
