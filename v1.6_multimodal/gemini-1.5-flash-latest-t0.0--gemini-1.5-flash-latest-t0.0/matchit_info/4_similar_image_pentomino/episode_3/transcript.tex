The orange shape is a backwards L on top of a rectangle. The orange shape is on the left side of the image. The purple plus sign is in the middle of the image. The pink letter P is on the right side of the image. The pink letter T is below the pink letter P. There is also a green shape on the right side of the image. The green shape is made of three rectangles. The top rectangle is on top of the middle rectangle. The bottom rectangle is to the right of the middle rectangle. The green shape is above the orange shape.
