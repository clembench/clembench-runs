	 DESCRIPTION: The image contains a series of pixelated shapes in different colors. There are four distinct shapes, each in a different color: purple, green, pink, and orange. Each shape resembles a Tetris block configuration. The purple shape looks like a "T," the green shape is a zigzag pattern, the pink shape is also a "T" but with a lighter shade, and the orange shape is an "L" turned upside down. The background is white, and the shapes do not touch each other.
