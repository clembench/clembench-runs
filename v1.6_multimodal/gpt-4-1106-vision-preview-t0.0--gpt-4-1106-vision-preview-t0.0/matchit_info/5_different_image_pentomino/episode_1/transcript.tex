Each shape resembles a Tetris block configuration. The purple shape looks like a "T" block, the green shape is an "L" block, the pink shape is a "T" block but with an additional pixel that extends from the center, and the orange shape is a zigzag "Z" block. The background is white, and the shapes do not touch each other.
