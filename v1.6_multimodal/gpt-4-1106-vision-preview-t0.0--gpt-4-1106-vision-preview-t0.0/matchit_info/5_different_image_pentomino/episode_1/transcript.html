        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image contains a series of pixelated shapes in different colors. There are four distinct shapes, each in a different color: purple, green, pink, and orange. Each shape resembles a Tetris block configuration. The purple shape looks like a &quot;T&quot; block, the green shape is an &quot;L&quot; block, the pink shape is a &quot;T&quot; block but with an additional pixel that extends from the center, and the orange shape is a zigzag &quot;Z&quot; block.
