Each shape is made up of square blocks arranged in a Tetris-like configuration. The purple shape resembles a "T," the green shape looks like an "S" or a zigzag, the pink shape is another "T" but with a different orientation, and the orange shape is an "L" or a right angle. The background is white, and the shapes do not touch each other.
