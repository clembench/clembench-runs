	 ANSWER: The shapes in my image are not arranged in a specific sequence that would fit together like a traditional game of Tetris. They are scattered with space between them. The orientation of each shape is as follows: the purple cross is upright, the dark green shape is a vertical column with two protruding blocks on the left, resembling a staircase, the light green shape is a horizontal line with a block extending downward at the right end, the orange shape is a horizontal zigzag, and the pink shape is a T oriented with the base at the bottom.

The light green shape is positioned below the purple cross and to the left of the dark green shape, forming a right angle. The orange zigzag is located at the bottom left, separated from the light green shape by some space. The pink T shape is isolated on the right side of the image, away from the other shapes.
