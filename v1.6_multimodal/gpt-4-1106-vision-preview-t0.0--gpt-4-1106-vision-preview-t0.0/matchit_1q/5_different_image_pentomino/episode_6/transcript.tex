	 DESCRIPTION: The image appears to be an abstract collection of pixelated shapes in various colors. There is a purple cross shape in the top left, connected to a series of green, olive, and yellow zigzagging shapes that resemble a staircase. To the right, there is a separate pink shape that looks like a sideways "T." In the bottom left corner, there is an isolated yellow shape that mirrors the zigzag pattern above but is disconnected from the other shapes. The background is white, and the overall image has a very simplistic, digital, and blocky aesthetic.
