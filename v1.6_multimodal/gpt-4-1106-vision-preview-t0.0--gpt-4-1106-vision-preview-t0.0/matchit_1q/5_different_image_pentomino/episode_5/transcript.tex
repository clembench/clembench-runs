	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixelated representation of what appears to be a collection of Tetris blocks in various colors. There is a purple cross-shaped block at the top left, followed by a horizontal line of green blocks that steps down in a zigzag pattern. Below the green blocks, there is an orange zigzag pattern that mirrors the green one above it. To the right, there is a pink block with a small square hole near the top, and below it, a pink T-shaped block. The background is white, and the overall image has a very simplistic, game-like aesthetic.

There are six distinct shapes, each in a different color: red, purple, yellow, orange, dark red, and dark purple. The shapes are arranged against a white background and do not touch each other.
