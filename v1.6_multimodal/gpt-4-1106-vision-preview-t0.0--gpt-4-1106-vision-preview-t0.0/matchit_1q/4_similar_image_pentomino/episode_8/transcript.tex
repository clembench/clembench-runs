On the left, there is a purple "T" shaped block on top of a green "L" shaped block, which is above an orange "L" shaped block facing the opposite direction. On the right, there is a pink "P" shaped block above a pink "T" shaped block. The background is white, and the blocks are not aligned in a way that would occur in an actual game of Tetris; they are scattered.
