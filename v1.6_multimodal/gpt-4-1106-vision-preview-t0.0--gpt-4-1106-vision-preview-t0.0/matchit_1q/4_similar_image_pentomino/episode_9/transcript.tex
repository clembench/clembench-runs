There are seven distinct shapes, each in a different color: purple, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and dark purple. The shapes resemble the Tetris game pieces known as Tetriminos. Each shape is composed of four squares, arranged differently to form the following Tetriminos: T, Z, L, O, S, I, and J. The background is white.
