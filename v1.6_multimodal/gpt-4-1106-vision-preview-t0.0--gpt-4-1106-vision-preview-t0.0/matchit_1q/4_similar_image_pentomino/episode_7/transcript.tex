There are two plus-sign shapes, one purple and one pink, located towards the top left and top right of the image, respectively. There are two 'L' shaped figures, one composed of green and yellow pixels and the other solely of green pixels, situated on the left and right sides of the image. The green and yellow 'L' shape is connected by a line of yellow pixels that extends towards the bottom of the image.
