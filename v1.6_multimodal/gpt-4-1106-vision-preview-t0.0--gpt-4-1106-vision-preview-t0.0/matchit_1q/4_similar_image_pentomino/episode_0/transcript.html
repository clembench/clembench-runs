    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: The Tetris-like shapes are separate from each other and are scattered across the image. The green and purple shape is positioned vertically and resembles a &quot;T&quot; with the purple block at the center. The green and orange shape is also vertical, with the orange part forming an &quot;L&quot; shape at the bottom. The pink &quot;T&quot; is oriented horizontally towards the right side of the image, and the orange &quot;T&quot; is also horizontal, located towards the bottom left of the image. Each shape has its own orientation and none of them are touching or connected.</p>

        <p>ANSWER: The colors of the Tetris-like shapes are solid with no gradients or patterns within them. The shapes are not composed of an equal number of blocks; for example, the purple and pink shapes have four blocks each, forming a &quot;T&quot; shape, while the green shape has seven blocks arranged in a &quot;Z&quot; or &quot;N&quot; pattern, and the orange shape has four blocks in an &quot;L&quot; or reversed &quot;J&quot; configuration.</p>
