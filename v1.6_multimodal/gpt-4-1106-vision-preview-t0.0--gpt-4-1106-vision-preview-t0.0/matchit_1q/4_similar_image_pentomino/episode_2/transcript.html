        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image appears to be an abstract collection of pixelated shapes in various colors. There are four distinct shapes, each a different color: purple, green, pink, and orange. Each shape has a jagged, Tetris-like appearance. The purple shape resembles a cross or a plus sign, the green shape looks like a zigzag or a staircase, the pink shape is similar to a T or a hammer, and the orange shape also has a zigzag or lightning bolt pattern. The background is white, and the shapes do not touch each other.</p>
