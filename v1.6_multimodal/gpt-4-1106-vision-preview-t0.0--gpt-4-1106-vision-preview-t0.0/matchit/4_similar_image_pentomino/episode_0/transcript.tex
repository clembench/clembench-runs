	 ANSWER: In my image, the green zigzag pattern resembles the letter "S" in its configuration, and the orange shape is a regular "L" shape mirrored horizontally, not elongated or styled in any other way.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
