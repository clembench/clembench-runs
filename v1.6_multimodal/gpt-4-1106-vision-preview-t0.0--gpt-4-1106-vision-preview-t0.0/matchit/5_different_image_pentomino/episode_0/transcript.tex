	 ANSWER: No, there are no pink blocks in my image. All blocks are of different colors, including purple, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and dark purple, but none are pink.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
