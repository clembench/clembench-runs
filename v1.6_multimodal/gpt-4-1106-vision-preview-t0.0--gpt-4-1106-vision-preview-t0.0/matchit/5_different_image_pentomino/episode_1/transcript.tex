Each shape is made up of square blocks arranged in a pattern that could be interpreted as Tetris-like pieces. The purple and pink shapes resemble a "T" or a cross, the green shape looks like a "Z" or an "N," and the orange shape resembles an "L" or a reversed "J." The background is white, and the overall image has a minimalist, game-like aesthetic.
