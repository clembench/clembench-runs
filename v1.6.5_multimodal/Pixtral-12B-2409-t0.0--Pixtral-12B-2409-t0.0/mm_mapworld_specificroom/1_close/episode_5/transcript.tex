	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead.
