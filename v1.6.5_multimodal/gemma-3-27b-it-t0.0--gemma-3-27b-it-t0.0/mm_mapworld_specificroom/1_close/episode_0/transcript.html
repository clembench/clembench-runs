        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot; instead. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>The target room is a bathroom.<br/>We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west.
