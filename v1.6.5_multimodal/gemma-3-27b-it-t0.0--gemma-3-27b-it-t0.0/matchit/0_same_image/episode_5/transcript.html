    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: There are several houseboats that clearly appear to be lived in. I can see curtains in some windows, and a few have small gardens or potted plants on the decks. They don’t look like tour boats at all.<br/>QUESTION: Is there a prominent church steeple or tower visible in the background?

        <p>ANSWER: Yes, there is a church steeple visible in the background, slightly to the left of center. It&#x27;s not overwhelmingly large, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.<br/><br/>QUESTION: Looking at the boats on the canal, are any of them very narrow and long – almost like traditional Dutch barges – or are they mostly wider, more modern-looking boats?</p>
