	 ANSWER: The corner of the larger orange 'L' shape is a sharp, 90-degree angle.\\ \tt QUESTION: Is the purple block positioned directly to the right of the second green 'T' shape, or is there a noticeable horizontal gap between them? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
