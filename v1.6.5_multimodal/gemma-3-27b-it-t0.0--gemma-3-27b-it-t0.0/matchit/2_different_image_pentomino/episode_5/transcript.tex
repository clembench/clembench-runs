The shapes are different colors: dark green, orange, purple, and pink. They all appear to be made up of connected squares or blocks.

	 ANSWER: No, all the shapes appear to be roughly the same size, with no single shape significantly larger than the others.\\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: In your image, are any of the shapes arranged *on top* of each other, creating a stacked effect?\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
