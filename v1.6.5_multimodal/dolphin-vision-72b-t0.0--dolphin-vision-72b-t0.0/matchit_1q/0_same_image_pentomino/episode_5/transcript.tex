The colors used are olive green, purple, orange, and pink, with the background being a light color that does not attract attention to itself. The arrangement of the blocks and the choice of colors seem random and do not form any recognizable pattern. There is no discernible text or additional elements, and the composition is simple and not overly complex.

Next to the rectangle, there are two overlapping orange squares. Below these is a green rectangle, partially obscured by the orange squares. To the right, there are two more orange squares aligned vertically. Above the pink rectangle and green rectangle, there's a pink square. The last visible shape is a yellow zigzag, which stands out against the other squares.\\ \tt \\ \tt Remember, this is my description, and I have provided no opinions or other information beyond an objective description of the shapes and colors visible in the image.
