The letters are blocky and exhibit a pixelated appearance, implying a digital or video game aesthetic. They are arranged in a left-to-right horizontal sequence, with each letter having a three-dimensional appearance.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is reminiscent of the Tetris video game blocks. There are five block pieces in total, with each piece made up of four squares of the same color. On the left side, starting from the top, there is a green "L" shaped piece, followed by a yellow "I" shaped piece. On the right side, starting from the top, there is a purple "T" shaped piece, followed by a large orange "O" shaped piece, and at the bottom, there is a pink square shape. These blocks are floating and appear to be of a size that could fit comfortably on a smartphone screen.
