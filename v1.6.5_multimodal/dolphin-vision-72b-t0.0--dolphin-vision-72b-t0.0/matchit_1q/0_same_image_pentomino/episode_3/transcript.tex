	 DESCRIPTION: The image displays a group of pixelated Tetris block shapes, each with a distinct color. Starting from the top left, there is a horizontally stretched purple "T" block, then an orange "T"-shaped block directly below it. To the right of the orange block, an upright "T" block in green is present. Adjacent to the green, another upside-down green "T" block is visible. A pink rectangle block is positioned to the far right at the bottom. All these are against a white background, making the colors and shapes clearly distinguishable.

	 This is my DESCRIPTION: The image consists of stylized blocks arranged in a grid. The blocks represent the letters "HAPPY" and a smiley face. The colors used are purple, green, orange, and a light pink. The background is white, and the blocks are the main focus of the graphic, with no additional elements or background detail.\\ \tt Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my image that may be different to your image.

	 Based on the description, my image contains specific Tetris block shapes without any direct representation of letters or a smiley face. However, your image seems to contain blocks that are intentionally shaped to represent letters and a smiley face. \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Do any of the shapes in your image have a particular arrangement or pattern that signifies letters or symbols that can be read as text?
