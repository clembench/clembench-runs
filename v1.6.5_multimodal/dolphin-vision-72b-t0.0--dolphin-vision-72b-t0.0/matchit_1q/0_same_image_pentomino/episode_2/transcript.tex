The colors are limited, with the 'P' being purple, 'R' in blue, 'E' in green, and 'T' in orange. This stylized depiction uses geometric shapes and solid colors, lacking in intricate detail, to represent the figure.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixel art representation featuring various shapes and colors, including a blue cross, green squares, red squares, yellow zigzag pattern, and a green rectangle. It appears to be an abstract digital composition with a playful or educational tone. The shapes are geometric, with simple color blocks and no detailed textures or shading. The background is plain white, which highlights the vibrant pixel shapes in the composition.
