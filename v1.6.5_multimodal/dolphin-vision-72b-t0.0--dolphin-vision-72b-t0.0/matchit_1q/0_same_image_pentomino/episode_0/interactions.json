Each shape is made up of four squares (or Tetris tetriminoes) arranged in a distinctive manner. From top to bottom, we have a purple 'T', a green 'F', a pink 'T', a teal square, and an orange 'I'. The 'T' shapes consist of three squares placed in a line and one square directly above the middle of the line, creating a 'T' figure. The 'F' shape resembles an 'F', with four squares placed in an arrangement where one stands apart from the group of three. The teal shape is the simplest, with four squares connected edge to edge. The orange 'I' shape has four squares lined up vertically."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-21T10:23:19.044189", "action": {"type": "valid format", "content": "continue"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 2", "timestamp": "2024-08-21T10:23:19.044273", "action": {"type": "send message (reprompt)", "content": "This is my DESCRIPTION: This image depicts three distinct pixel art characters that might serve as avatars or icons in a game or application.
