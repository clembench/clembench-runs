	 DESCRIPTION: The image contains a collection of pixelated Tetris pieces with four distinct colors: purple, green, peach, and orange. There is a horizontal arrangement with various types of Tetris pieces, including a purple cross, a green 'T' shaped piece, a peach 'T', and an orange zigzag. The pieces are slightly overlapping, suggesting the possibility of fitting together similar to the game of Tetris.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image features a simplistic arrangement of colored shapes against a white background. The purple plus sign is the largest figure and occupies the left side of the image. The teal plus sign is smaller and placed above the green one. Between these two, a green "F" is depicted horizontally. The orange zigzag shape is to the right of the "F" and green shape arrangement, with a pink "P" sitting above it. The objects are not aligned with each other, and they appear in a layout that does not suggest hierarchy or interaction. The color scheme is bright and contrasts sharply against the white background.\\ \tt \\ \tt Please follow with your description so we can proceed with the comparison.
