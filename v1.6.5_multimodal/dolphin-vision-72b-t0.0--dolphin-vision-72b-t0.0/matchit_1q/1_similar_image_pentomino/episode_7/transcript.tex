	 DESCRIPTION: The image contains four distinct shapes, each with a solid color and a contrasting border that outlines its form. Starting from the top left and moving right, the shapes are a purple circle with a yellow outline, a teal square with an orange outline, and a light purple rectangle with a darker purple outline. The bottom row has a yellow zigzag line with an orange outline, and finally on the bottom right, there is a pink rectangle with a darker pink outline. The arrangement is informal with the shapes overlapping slightly, against a clean, uncluttered white background.

	 DESCRIPTION: This is a simple pixel art graphic that features four distinct shapes, each with its own color, against a white background. The graphic includes two "T" shapes, one green and one pink, a yellow rectangle, and an orange "Z" shape. These shapes are all arranged separately with plenty of space between them, and no overlapping occurs. The image's simplicity allows for clear observation of each individual element.
