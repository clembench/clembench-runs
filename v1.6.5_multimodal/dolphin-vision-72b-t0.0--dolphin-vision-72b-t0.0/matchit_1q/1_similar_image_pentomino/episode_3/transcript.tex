Two vertical green pillars appear on the left, and a pink square can be seen at the bottom right on the game grid, which itself shows some completed lines ready to be cleared. The colors of the pieces are vivid and stand out against the grid's light gray.

	 ANSWER: In my image, the only dynamic element is the T-shaped Tetris piece, which seems to be falling or in the process of rotation. All other pieces appear static, positioned on the grid. The background is a simple grid with completed lines highlighted in white, suggesting they are ready to clear. There are no side graphics like score displays visible in this portion of the screen.

	 The differences in the dynamic nature of the pieces, the presence of a game background, and the grid for gameplay indicate that my picture and the other picture described are not the same.
