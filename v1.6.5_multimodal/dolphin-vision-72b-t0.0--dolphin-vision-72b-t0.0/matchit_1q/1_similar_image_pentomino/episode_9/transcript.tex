	 DESCRIPTION: The image you've provided is a collection of pixel art shapes, similar to those found in classic Tetris games or pixel art. The shapes are made up of squares and the color palette is limited to purple, yellow, and red. There appears to be no specific pattern or arrangement to these shapes, and they cover different areas of the image, with some overlapping. The background is a plain white, with some areas covered by the colorful shapes. Please note that this description is solely based on the image provided and does not infer any additional information about another unseen image.

	 The image provided is of a simple collection of stylized Tetris blocks. If you're providing a description of another image for a comparison, please ensure it includes details such as the number and type of shapes (e.g., squares, rectangles), their colors, if they are patterned or solid, and their arrangement. This information is crucial to determine if the images contain the same patterns or are entirely different. Please proceed with your description.
