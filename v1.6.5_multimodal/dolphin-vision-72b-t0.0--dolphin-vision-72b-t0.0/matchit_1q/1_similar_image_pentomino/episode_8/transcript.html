        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image contains a series of Tetris blocks in a grid-like arrangement. Each block has a distinct color and orientation. The blocks are not aligned in the grid, giving the impression that they are either falling or placed in mid-action, as seen in the actual Tetris game. The colors include orange, green, purple, pink, yellow, and black. The pattern of colors and shapes resembles what one might find on a Tetris screen, with the game paused or at rest.</p>

        <p>Based on the image descriptions provided, it seems that the two images are indeed different. The image I described is a simple, static arrangement of blocks forming the letters &quot;FT,&quot; while the other image is dynamic, resembling a scene from a game of Tetris with a variety of colored blocks. The purpose and elements of each image are distinct: one is a graphic with a clear, retro design motif, and the other represents a game scene with active block pieces. Therefore, the two images do not match. <br/><br/>DECISION: different images</p>
