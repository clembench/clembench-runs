There appears to be a deliberate choice in the arrangement of these symbols, which may suggest they are part of a game or a pattern-finding challenge. The colors are vivid and there is no shading or gradient, which gives the symbols a flat appearance. The presence of these colors and shapes suggests a focus on visual elements rather than a narrative or realistic representation.
