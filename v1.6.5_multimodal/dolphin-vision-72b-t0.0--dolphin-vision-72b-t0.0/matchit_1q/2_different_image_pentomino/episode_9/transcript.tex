The blocks vary in color, including red, orange, yellow, purple, and purple with a yellow outline, and are placed in no particular pattern. They are composed of filled squares without any gradients or shading. The colors are vibrant and distinct, and their arrangement seems random, with no overlap or interaction between the blocks.
