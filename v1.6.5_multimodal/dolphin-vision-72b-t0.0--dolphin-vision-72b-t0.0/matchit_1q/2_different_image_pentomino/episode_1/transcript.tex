From top to bottom: a 3x3 purple cross, a 5x2 green rectangular block with two pink squares at the center, and a 6x2 orange zigzag pattern. There's a thin white line separating the green and orange blocks. The colors are primary and vivid. The blocks are solid and pixelated, indicating a digital or screen-based artwork.
