There are four distinct Tetris pieces; a purple cross, a green 'elbow' piece, a pink 'elbow' piece, and an orange 'staircase' piece. The blocks are on a white background with no other objects or texts. This description is limited to what can be clearly discerned and does not include any assumptions or interpretations beyond what is visible.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image consists of several pixelated shapes, each with distinct solid colors and without any gradients or shadows. The shapes are a cross, a line, and two T-formations. The cross is vibrant yellow, the line is purple, and the T-formations are red and dark purple, respectively. The shapes are separated from each other by white space, creating a simple, straightforward presentation without any apparent background story or action.

	 This is my DESCRIPTION: The image presented appears to be a set of Tetris blocks arranged in a non-linear fashion. There are four distinct Tetris pieces; a purple cross, a green 'elbow' piece, a pink 'elbow' piece, and an orange 'staircase' piece. The blocks are on a white background with no other objects or texts.

	 Based on your description, it seems that your Tetris pieces include some that aren't present in my description, such as the green 'elbow'. Given the differences in color and shape, a question to clarify further would be: "QUESTION: Can you describe any additional details or features on the green elbow piece, such as patterns or gradients that might be part of its design?"
