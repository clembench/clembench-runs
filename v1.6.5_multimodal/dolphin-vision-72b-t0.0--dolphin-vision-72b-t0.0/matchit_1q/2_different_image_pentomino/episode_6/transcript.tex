	 DESCRIPTION: The image consists of a collection of four distinct geometric shapes, each with a solid, bright color fill (red, blue, orange, and yellow) with a black border. The shapes include one "U" shape, one "T" shape, one "L" shape, and one straight line. They are arranged in a relatively scattered manner without any overlapping, with a prominent yellow "T" shape in the center. The background of the image is white, offering a stark contrast to the shapes. There is no pattern of arrangement, and the shapes are separate from each other, not forming a composite image or symbol.
