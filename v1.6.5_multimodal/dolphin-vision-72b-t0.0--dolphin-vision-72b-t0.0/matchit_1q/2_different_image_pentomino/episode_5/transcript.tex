The top rectangle includes a purple plus sign, a dark purple T-shape, a green zigzag, and an orange zigzag, arranged horizontally. Below, the second rectangle has a single pink T-shape. The two rectangles are filled with these shapes and set against a solid white background with a slight pixelation effect, especially noticeable in the lower half of the image.

	 Based on the image descriptions provided, it seems that there are distinct differences between the two images. The described images differ in terms of the number of shapes and the way they are arranged. The primary image has a simple arrangement of non-related shapes, whereas the other image has a more structured layout with a pattern of Tetris-like shapes within rectangles. Therefore, the decision is as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt DECISION: different images
