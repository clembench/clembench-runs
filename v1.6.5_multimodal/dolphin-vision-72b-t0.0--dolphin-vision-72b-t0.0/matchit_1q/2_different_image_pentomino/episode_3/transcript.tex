	 DESCRIPTION: The image features a selection of Tetris blocks displayed in a two-dimensional space. The arrangement includes various shapes that represent the different Tetris pieces available in the game, such as straight lines, squares, L-shapes, S-shapes, and T-shapes. The colors used for these shapes are orange, pink, green, and purple, each set against a clear white background which makes the colors stand out. There is no shadow or depth, suggesting a flat, two-dimensional representation. The blocks' placement is random and does not follow a pattern or structure. They are not connected to one another and are not arranged in a way that suggests a game in progress but rather a selection of the different types of blocks available. The image is simple, with no gradients or textures, focusing on the block shapes and their colors.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image appears to be a stylized representation of the male and female gender symbols, arranged in an abstract manner. The gender symbols are colored in red and yellow, respectively, with the male symbol featuring a cross with a circle above it and the female symbol consisting of a circle atop a horizontal rectangle. These symbols are placed on a horizontal red bar, and to the right, there are two purple crosses and a yellow cross. This is a minimalistic design with no background elements or text.

The first image describes a collection of Tetris game pieces without any background or contextual elements. In contrast, the second image discusses a stylized representation of gender symbols placed on a colored bar with a different background setting. The symbols, colors, and arrangements between the two are notably distinct, and there is no overlap in visual content or design elements. Therefore, the two images are not the same.
