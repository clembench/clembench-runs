        <p>ANSWER: In the described image, there are no red or pure yellow pieces. There is an orange square with a yellow plus sign in the center, which could be interpreted as a piece combining color patterns.

    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: In the image, all the Tetris-shaped figures are separate and distinct, with no overlapping pieces. They are arranged in a staggered manner at various heights. As for unique shapes, the yellow &#x27;plus&#x27; sign is a unique shape not typically found in Tetris, but there is no cross or &#x27;F&#x27; shape present in the figures described.</p>

        <p>ANSWER: In the image, all the Tetris-shaped figures are separate and distinct, with no overlapping pieces. They are arranged in a staggered manner at various heights. As for unique shapes, the yellow &#x27;plus&#x27; sign is a unique shape not typically found in Tetris, but there is no cross or &#x27;F&#x27; shape present in the figures described.<br/>Now come to a decision.

    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>DECISION: different images. <br/><br/>The key differences that lead to this conclusion are the presence of a green cross and an &#x27;F&#x27; shaped piece in your image, which are not in mine. Additionally, the described red &#x27;Z&#x27; and yellow &#x27;L&#x27; shapes are absent in your image. The unique yellow &#x27;plus&#x27; sign in the lower part of your image is also not present. The overall shape and placement of the pieces differ between the two descriptions, which indicates these are separate images.</p>
