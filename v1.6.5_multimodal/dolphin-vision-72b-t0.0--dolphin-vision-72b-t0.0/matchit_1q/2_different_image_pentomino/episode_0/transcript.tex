There are two green pieces, one forming a cross, and the other shaped like an 'F'. A pink 'Z' piece is also present. Additionally, there are two orange pieces: one straight and one with a slight angle. A purple square and a similar piece with an orange square in the center are also displayed. Each piece is separate from the others, but they're all types of pieces that might be found in a child's interlocking puzzle set.

The figures are staggered in placement with no specific pattern, floating on a white background. The 'L', 'Z', and 'square' are on a lower horizontal plane, while the 'T' shapes are on a higher plane. The 'plus' sign is at the lowest point, centrally located. No two figures overlap.

However, there are no pieces in the image that have another shape inside them solely based on the colors mentioned in the description.

	 ANSWER: In the image, all the Tetris-shaped figures are separate and distinct, with no overlapping pieces. They are arranged in a staggered manner at various heights.

Additionally, the described red 'Z' and yellow 'L' shapes are absent in your image. The unique yellow 'plus' sign in the lower part of your image is also not present. The overall shape and placement of the pieces differ between the two descriptions, which indicates these are separate images.
