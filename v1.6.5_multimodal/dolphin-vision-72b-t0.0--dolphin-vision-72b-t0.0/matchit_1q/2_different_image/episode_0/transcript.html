The primary focus is on the interaction between an adult and a younger giraffe, possibly indicating a mother and calf relationship. The enclosure, made from a dry ground with rocks and sparse vegetation, is bordered by a low fence. The background is more green and verdant, contrasting with the enclosure&#x27;s arid appearance.
