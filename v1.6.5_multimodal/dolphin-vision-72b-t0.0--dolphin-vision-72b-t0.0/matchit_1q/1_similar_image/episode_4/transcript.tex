	 DECISION: different images\\ \tt \\ \tt The edges of the pizzas described are quite distinct. Your image has a puffy and uniformly thick crust, while the one I described has a slightly uneven edge, indicative of a hand-tossed technique. Additionally, my image shows a pizza adorned with red peppers, which are not present in the image you just described. Based on these noticeable differences, it is reasonable to conclude that the pictures are not of the same pizza.
