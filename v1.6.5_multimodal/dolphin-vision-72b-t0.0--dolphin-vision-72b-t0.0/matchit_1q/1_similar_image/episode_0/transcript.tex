	 DESCRIPTION: This is a modern kitchen with white cabinetry and stainless steel appliances. The prominent features include a built-in microwave, a stove with an oven, and a sink, all situated on a countertop with a white surface. The cabinetry has a uniform style with silver handles, and the drawers are labeled. The backsplash and floor are in contrasting colors, creating a checkerboard pattern between the light beige and the dark squares. Natural light illuminates the space, and no personal items are visible, which gives an impression of a display kitchen or a recently cleaned space with minimal use.

	 Based on your description, "Image 2" appears to closely match the image I have described. However, to ascertain whether they are the same, I would need to confirm certain details. Do the labels on the drawers in "Image 2" appear to be the same as the ones on my image? Also, is there a specific pattern on the floor tiles in "Image 2"?
