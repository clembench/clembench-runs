	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short image description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

	 As an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have the capability to store or recall images or any form of visual memory. Therefore, I cannot participate in an image-comparison activity. However, if you provide a description of the image you're thinking of, I could compare the described details to my description above and we might be able to have a discussion about the similarities and differences between the two based on the descriptions alone. Please start by describing the other image you're referring to.
