	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short image description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

	 The photograph I have described is that of an adult elephant and a calf on a grassy path. This image could serve as useful information in the collaborative game we are playing. To determine if it matches the other image, I would need a description of that image to compare details such as the number of subjects, the setting, the color palette, and any distinctive features or actions that are captured in the photograph. If these elements correspond, we would have a potential match that could be compared further.
