	 DESCRIPTION: The image captures a lone black bear in its natural habitat, seen from the side as it walks through a grassy area. It is a clear, sunny day, and the bear's dark fur is contrasted against the vibrant greenery. The forested background suggests that this is a setting within a larger ecosystem, possibly a national park or a nature reserve. The bear's movement is unhindered and it seems to be foraging or traversing its territory.\\ \tt \\ \tt To identify whether this image and your unseen image are the same, I would need to ask about specific details such as the bear's size relative to the surroundings, the type and color of vegetation, the weather conditions at the time of the photograph, and any distinctive markings or features on the bear. If the details I provide about this bear match those in your description, it could indicate that the images are the same.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image depicts a black bear in a natural woodland setting. The bear is large and its dark fur stands out against the green foliage. It appears to be grazing or foraging on a slope, which is covered with a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees. The photograph is taken during the daytime, and the lighting is soft, likely due to the canopy overhead. There are no visible tags or other indicators to suggest this bear is being monitored or is in a zoo. The lack of any human-made objects suggests a wild, natural habitat.

	 DECISION: same image\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the detailed descriptions provided, it appears that the images of the bears are indeed the same. The consistency in the bear's size, the green foliage, the daylight conditions, and the natural setting without any human-made elements suggest that the two images represent the same moment captured in time. The lack of distinctive markings on the bear and the similar descriptions of the surroundings further aligns the two images described.
