	 DESCRIPTION: The photograph is a monochrome image of a herd of sheep gathered closely together in a field. One lamb stands out from the rest due to its fluffier, more unkempt wool and its position at the forefront of the group. The background is indistinct, but the focus on the sheep suggests a pastoral setting with a natural, outdoor environment. The texture of the sheep's wool is detailed, with each animal possessing unique characteristics in their wool and facial expressions.

	 Based on the provided descriptions, it appears that the two images are variations of the same scenario, primarily depicting a herd of sheep with one particularly highlighted due to its fluffy coat and central position. The consistency in the depiction of the sheep and the pastoral setting, along with the presence of one standout lamb in both descriptions, suggests that these are indeed the same picture. Therefore, the decision would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt DECISION: same image
