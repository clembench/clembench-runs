The terrain is open and speckled with rocks and shrubs, and the backdrop is a soft, hazy blue sky with light cloud cover.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image depicts a solitary chestnut horse with a white blaze on its forehead and nose, standing on a grassy plain with scattered rocks. The horse is oriented towards the right of the frame, with its body positioned between two rocks. In the background, there are mountains that appear at a distance and under light cloud cover. The overall color palette is natural and muted, with green grass, brown earth, and hints of grey in the rocks and distant mountains. The sky is partly cloudy, contributing to a soft lighting condition over the scene.

	 Given the similarities in the two image descriptions, it seems that they are the same photograph. However, to ensure this, could you please confirm the presence of the horse's distinctive white blaze on its forehead and nose, and the position of the horse's body in relation to the surrounding rocks as mentioned in your description?
