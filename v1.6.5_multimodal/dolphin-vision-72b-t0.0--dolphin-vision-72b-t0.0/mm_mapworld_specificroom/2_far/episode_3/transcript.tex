	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a bathroom.\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the image provided, it appears that the room is indeed a hallway, characterized by its narrowness and leading towards a distant light source. The walls are lined with red elements that resemble casks, which could indicate the historical use of the space, possibly as a wine cellar given the context and construction style. The corridor has a red-tinted ambient light, which might be an intentional choice to create a specific atmosphere or to highlight the historical features of the space.\\ \tt \\ \tt "{"description": "We are in a narrow hallway with red cask-like walls, heading towards a glowing exit under low arches.", "action": "GO: north"}"
