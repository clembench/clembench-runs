	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a bathroom.\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the context of the image, we are in the Boston Bruins' locker room, not a patio as previously described. It seems there has been a mix-up with the instructions. Assuming the target room is indeed a patio and the image is only for illustration, the appropriate next instruction, to match the description provided earlier, would be to move west towards the patio. However, if the target room is meant to be the one depicted in the image, since the room is identified as the Boston Bruins' locker room, the appropriate action would be "DONE". \\ \tt \\ \tt Given that the current scenario does not match the target room description provided, please clarify whether the target room is meant to be a patio or if the image is the intended target room.
