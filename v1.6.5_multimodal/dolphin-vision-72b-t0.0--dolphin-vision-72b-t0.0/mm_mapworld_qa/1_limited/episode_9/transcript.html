        <p>We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. Replace &lt;room description&gt; with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot;. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west.

        <p>Given the layout of the rooms as described, the current direction seems to be north towards the restrooms. Since the task is to visit all rooms with the fewest room changes possible and we have already visited the main area and the restrooms, the next logical step would be to move away from the restrooms and investigate the remaining directions to cover all the available rooms. Given the options, the best choice would be to go west since it is likely that east and south would lead to the main area again, and north leads to the restrooms which we&#x27;ve already explored.<br/><br/>{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;A utilitarian room with a brick column and benches; the left wall features utility boxes, while the right wall is open.&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;GO: west&quot;}</p>
