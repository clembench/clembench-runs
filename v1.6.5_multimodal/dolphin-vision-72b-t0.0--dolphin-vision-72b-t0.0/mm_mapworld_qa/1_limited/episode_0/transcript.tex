	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the description of this room and the available paths, it seems that this is a waiting area that serves as a central hub connecting multiple parts of a building. The next instruction would depend on whether there are other rooms to explore that are not directly adjacent to the current one. Since the image does not show any doors and there are no indications from the description that there are other paths, we can assume that this room is the starting point for the following directions. Therefore, the next action should be taken to explore a new room. Given the typical layout of such buildings, one might choose a direction that logically leads to another public or service-related space. For instance, if this waiting area is in a medical or veterinary clinic, heading south or west might lead to examination rooms or offices, while east could lead to an administrative or reception area. Without more specific information on the adjacent rooms, it is not possible to make an informed decision. Thus, I will give a generic instruction for the action:\\ \tt \\ \tt {"description": "The room is a clean, functional waiting area in what appears to be a clinical or service-oriented setting.", "action": "GO: east"}
