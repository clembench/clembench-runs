	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom", "action": "DONE"}\\ \tt Let us start. \\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 To proceed with the task described, we have two options: to go north or south. Since this is the starting point, I need to establish the cardinal directions relative to the room to direct appropriately. With the information available, it is not possible to determine true north from the image alone. However, if we assume that the primary entrance (which is not visible in the image) is to the north, the logical step to take would be to select the direction that explores the new rooms first, which could be either direction in this case since no indication is given of prior exploration.\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, a suitable recommendation would be:\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a playroom decorated with a space theme.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt assuming "north" is unexplored.\\ \tt \\ \tt If "north" is already taken and we need to explore a new room, then the recommendation would be:\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a playroom decorated with a space theme.", "action": "GO: south"}
