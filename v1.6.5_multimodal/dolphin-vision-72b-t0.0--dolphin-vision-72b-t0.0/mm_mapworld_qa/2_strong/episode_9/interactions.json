Given the options to travel north or south, and based on common room layouts, traditionally the north direction may lead to areas like a living room or bedrooms, while south might lead to a hallway or a kitchen. However, without a clear map or knowledge of the specific building layout, it's not possible to provide a definitive action. If this is a residential home with a standard layout, a logical guess would be to try \"south,\" which could possibly lead to a common area like an entryway or hallway.
