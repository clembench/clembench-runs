	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Our current room is a storage closet, which is utilitarian in nature, with shelving and a clothes bar. Based on the provided directions available for the next move—east or north—it appears this room is the starting point and there are two possible directions to explore. Since the goal is to visit all rooms with the least number of changes possible, without further information about the layout of the rooms or the need to backstep, it is challenging to determine the optimal path. However, we can start with one direction and switch if it leads to a dead end.\\ \tt \\ \tt The next instruction, therefore, is:\\ \tt {"description": "We are in an empty storage closet with a metal trash can and white shelving.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt This action suggests moving to the room that lies north of our current position.
