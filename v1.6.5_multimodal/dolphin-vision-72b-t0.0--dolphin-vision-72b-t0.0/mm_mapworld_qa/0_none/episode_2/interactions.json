Given the options of south or east, we can proceed south to potentially reach a common area, which is often the direction a family might go to come together from the playroom. If the house layout follows a conventional design, heading south could lead to a central area or the kitchen, and east might lead to a less accessible part of the house or additional rooms for specific purposes such as sleep or work.
