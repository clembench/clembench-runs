	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the current room's layout with a sink and window, it resembles a kitchen or dining area, where we would typically expect to find access to living or dining spaces. Since the instructions are to visit all rooms with the fewest number of room changes and there's no clear indication of where east or west leads, a choice between north and south could be strategic if we assume typical house designs where kitchens lead to dining (south) or living (north) spaces. However, without a map or more specific directional information, the choice between these two directions could be made arbitrarily. For the sake of completing the task, I would choose one of the available directions.\\ \tt \\ \tt {"action": "GO: south"}
