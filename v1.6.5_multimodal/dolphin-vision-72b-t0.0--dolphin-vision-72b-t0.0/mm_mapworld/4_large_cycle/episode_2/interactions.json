Since the instructions are to visit all rooms with the fewest number of room changes and there's no clear indication of where east or west leads, a choice between north and south could be strategic if we assume typical house designs where kitchens lead to dining (south) or living (north) spaces. However, without a map or more specific directional information, the choice between these two directions could be made arbitrarily. For the sake of completing the task, I would choose one of the available directions.\n\n{\"action\": \"GO: south\"}"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T11:03:08.884540", "action": {"type": "Invalid format", "content": "Game aborted."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T11:03:08.884575", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": true}}]]}
