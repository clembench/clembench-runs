For the task of visiting all rooms with the fewest number of room changes, we need to decide where to go next. Given the available directions, \"east,\" \"south,\" and \"west,\" the next logical step would be to choose the direction that leads to the most unvisited rooms. Since there are no indoor rooms described in the image, we cannot proceed with the instructions as they are intended for an indoor environment.\n\nHowever, if the intent is to visit each bay inside these buildings, assuming they are accessible and the doors correspond to separate rooms (as the task description implies), the next steps could be:\n1. Go to one of the buildings (e.g., the first on the left as viewed in the image).\n2. If each bay is a separate 'room,' visit them in sequence.\n3. Once all bays in one building have been visited, move to the next available bay to the left or right, depending on the sequence followed.\n\nGiven that the doors are closed and there's no indication whether they are accessible or not, the specific actions cannot be determined without additional context. Under normal circumstances, the next instruction would be to GO: WEST, as that is the leftmost direction when facing the buildings.
