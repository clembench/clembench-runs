        <p>We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. Replace &lt;room description&gt; with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot;. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?<br/>{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;GO: north&quot;}<br/>We have made a step and are now in this room.

        <p>Based on the description provided, you are currently outside, facing a row of green buildings. For the task of visiting all rooms with the fewest number of room changes, we need to decide where to go next. Given the available directions, &quot;east,&quot; &quot;south,&quot; and &quot;west,&quot; the next logical step would be to choose the direction that leads to the most unvisited rooms. Since there are no indoor rooms described in the image, we cannot proceed with the instructions as they are intended for an indoor environment.<br/><br/>However, if the intent is to visit each bay inside these buildings, assuming they are accessible and the doors correspond to separate rooms (as the task description implies), the next steps could be:<br/>1. Go to one of the buildings (e.g., the first on the left as viewed in the image).<br/>2. If each bay is a separate &#x27;room,&#x27; visit them in sequence.<br/>3. Once all bays in one building have been visited, move to the next available bay to the left or right, depending on the sequence followed.<br/><br/>Given that the doors are closed and there&#x27;s no indication whether they are accessible or not, the specific actions cannot be determined without additional context. Under normal circumstances, the next instruction would be to GO: WEST, as that is the leftmost direction when facing the buildings. However, without confirmation of access, this is speculative.</p>
