As the goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest number of changes, we should choose the direction that likely leads to the most unvisited areas. However, without knowing the specific layout of the building, it is difficult to make an informed decision. Based on common room layout conventions, an eastward move could potentially lead to a common area like a dining room or kitchen, while south could lead to a personal space like a playroom or additional nursery area. Given that information and the presence of windows suggesting more rooms beyond this one, the best initial choice might be:\n\n{\"description\": \"We are in a nursery with playful decorations and toys.\", \"action\": \"GO: south\"}"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T11:00:53.690261", "action": {"type": "Invalid format", "content": "Game aborted."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T11:00:53.690296", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": true}}]]}
