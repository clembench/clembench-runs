Given the available directions, the action to take next should be based on the logical flow of moving through rooms in a space like this. Since bathrooms are typically not central rooms but situated off to the side or between main rooms, the most common direction to go after visiting a bathroom might be east or west, depending on the typical layout of the hotel.\n\nConsidering the standard floor plan of a hotel, bathrooms are often located next to bedrooms or sleeping areas. Therefore, the next reasonable move would be to head west, if it leads to a bedroom or a private space, which is a logical sequence in hotel room designs. East could lead to a hallway or another communal space, which might be necessary to explore as well, but without additional context, west seems the more likely choice.\n\nHence, the next instruction should be:\n{\"description\": \"We are in a hotel bathroom with a vintage television.\", \"action\": \"GO: west\"}"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T10:50:27.701035", "action": {"type": "Invalid format", "content": "Game aborted."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T10:50:27.701073", "action": {"type": "aborted", "content": true}}]]}
