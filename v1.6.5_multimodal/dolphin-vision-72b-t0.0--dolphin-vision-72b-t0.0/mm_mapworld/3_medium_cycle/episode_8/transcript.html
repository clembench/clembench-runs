        <p>We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. Replace &lt;room description&gt; with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot;. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west.

As for your next instruction in the context of the given options, since our goal is to visit all rooms with fewest number of room changes possible and assuming that the doors lead to new rooms, the next logical step in the exploration process is to continue to the **east**. This choice is based on the fact that east is the first direction listed, which could imply it&#x27;s the most direct path forward in a typical building layout.<br/><br/>**Action**: GO: east<br/><br/>Please note that this action is guided by the standard conventions of navigation described in the problem, and we&#x27;re expecting to find another room consistent in appearance and function with those normally adjacent to a utility room.</p>
