If we go south, that may lead to another living space or a transition zone like a hallway. Without knowing what lies beyond, we will make an educated guess based on the typical layout of a home.\n\nBased on standard home layouts, if this is a primary living area, the south direction often leads to a space that is more private, such as a bedroom or a bathroom.
