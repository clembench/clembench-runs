	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 To proceed, we need to choose the next room to explore based on the available directions from our current location. Since we are in the bay window room with a view of the outside, the options are west or south. \\ \tt \\ \tt If we go west, we likely will find another room that continues the residential theme, possibly a dining area or another living space. If we go south, that may lead to another living space or a transition zone like a hallway. Without knowing what lies beyond, we will make an educated guess based on the typical layout of a home.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on standard home layouts, if this is a primary living area, the south direction often leads to a space that is more private, such as a bedroom or a bathroom. If we are looking to continue our exploration through common areas, west may be the better choice.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given this information, the instruction would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bay windowed room with a serene view.", "action": "GO: west"}
