        <p>We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. Replace &lt;room description&gt; with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot;. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west.

        <p>I understand the description of the room. Based on the layout you&#x27;ve described, we are currently in a small study or home office, equipped with a desk and chair, and flanked by bookshelves. Considering the available exits, we have the option to move in the north, south, or east direction. To continue the exploration and move through the rooms while visiting them as few times as possible, I would advise taking the path that leads to an unexplored area. Without knowing which rooms have already been visited, I can only suggest a direction based on the available options. <br/><br/>If the rooms in the north and east have already been visited, moving south would be the optimal choice for progression. However, if the rooms to the north and east are yet to be explored, choosing either direction would continue the exploration. Since we cannot move in all directions at once, a decision has to be made based on the current information. Therefore, the next instruction for your exploration would depend on which direction leads to an unvisited room.<br/><br/>Given the information, if the northern and eastern paths lead to previously visited rooms, your instruction would be:<br/>{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;A small study with a desk, chair, and bookshelves.&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;GO: south&quot;}<br/><br/>If either the northern or eastern path leads to an unvisited room, choosing one of those directions would be the action to take.</p>
