When deciding on a direction, we should consider the layout and the presence of the fan and light fixture, which are typically situated in larger or central areas of a home. Since the fan is on the wall to the east, it would be safe to assume that the room to the north or south is more likely to be a smaller space or a hallway, as fan decorations are not commonly used in such transitional areas.
