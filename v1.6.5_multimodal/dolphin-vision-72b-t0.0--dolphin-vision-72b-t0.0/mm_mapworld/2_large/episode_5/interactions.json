Since there is no visual indication of the layout of the rooms beyond this one, we need to choose the direction that might logically lead to another room. Given that we are inside a building, choosing the path that aligns with the flow of the structure—often east-west along a corridor—may lead to additional rooms. However, without knowing the layout, it's not possible to determine the optimal path for the fewest room changes.\n\nIn the absence of specific layout information, we can apply common spatial reasoning and choose the western path, which might potentially lead to another wing of the building or an additional function area. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\n{\"description\": \"We are in a coin-operated laundry room.\", \"action\": \"GO: west\"}.\n\nIf we encounter a dead end or find ourselves in a circular path, we would have to adjust our strategy accordingly.
