	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the image provided, the room we are currently in is a kitchen with a compact style, featuring a sink, a small refrigerator, microwave, electric cooktop, and a kettle. There are two doors indicated by red circles, suggesting that we can proceed in either of two directions from this room. Given the task to visit all rooms with minimal transitions, the next logical step would be to move through one of these doors.\\ \tt \\ \tt {"description": "We are in a compact kitchen with limited appliances.", "action": "GO: west"}\\ \tt \\ \tt This decision is made with the assumption that each step takes us into a new room, and we are trying to explore the least number of doorways. The choice between 'west' or 'north' is somewhat arbitrary; however, without knowing the layout of the entire building, 'west' is simply the direction chosen here. If 'west' leads to a room that has another room accessible, we would move to that room and repeat the process. When no new rooms can be visited, we would decide we are done.
