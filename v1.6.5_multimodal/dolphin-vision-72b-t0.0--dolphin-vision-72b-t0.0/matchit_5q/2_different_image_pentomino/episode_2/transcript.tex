	 DESCRIPTION: The image depicts a collection of Tetris-like blocks in various colors, oriented in a seemingly random fashion with no clear pattern or interlock. The blocks are simple geometric shapes, predominantly square with some rectangles and L-shapes. The colors used are primary colors plus purple, commonly seen in many versions of the Tetris game.\\ \tt \\ \tt The second part of the guessing game requires the other participant to give a detailed description of their image, following the same format as above. Once descriptions are provided, we can compare elements such as the number of colors used, the types of shapes present, and any apparent patterns or arrangements. Without additional information, however, it's not possible to determine definitively if the images are the same or different. The next step would be to have the other player provide the description of their image, then any follow-up questions from either party to further clarify any ambiguous details or to establish congruence between the images.
