The prominent yellow cross is positioned in the middle and is of a substantial size compared to other elements. To the left of the cross, there is a small purple square. On the right side, a red triangular shape protrudes. Surrounding these elements, there are smaller shapes: an inverted purple \"U\", a purple \"T\", and a small red square. The shapes are outlined and have a jagged appearance consistent with pixel art, suggesting a digital or video game influence.
