	 DESCRIPTION: The image consists of six individual Tetris pieces arranged on a white background. There is a purple T piece, a green reverse-L, an orange zigzag, a pink reverse-T, a purple cross-shaped piece, and another pink reverse-T. The pieces are not touching each other and are displayed against a plain white background, allowing their colors and shapes to stand out. There is no action or movement implied in the image; it is a static arrangement of game pieces.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image presents an arrangement of simple, pixelated graphical elements on a plain white background. There are six distinct shapes: an inverted 'T' in orange, a 'J' in purple, two different 'I' shapes in pink and orange, a '+' in yellow, and two 'O' shapes, one in red and one in purple. The placement of these shapes is random and non-uniform. No patterns or background elements exist beyond the solid color of the surface on which the shapes rest.
