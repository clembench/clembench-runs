        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image consists of six individual Tetris pieces arranged on a white background. There is a purple T piece, a green reverse-L, an orange zigzag, a pink reverse-T, a purple cross-shaped piece, and another pink reverse-T. The pieces are not touching each other and are displayed against a plain white background, allowing their colors and shapes to stand out. There is no action or movement implied in the image; it is a static arrangement of game pieces.</p>
