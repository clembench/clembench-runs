        <p>DECISION: different images<br/><br/>The key differences between the two images include the variety of colors and the absence of a deliberate pattern in the image I described, as opposed to the specific arrangement of pieces in the description provided for the comparison image. Additionally, the presence of shadows or depth cues in the comparison image that suggest volume is a distinct difference from the flat, two-dimensional appearance of the pieces in the image I described. These differences indicate that the images are not the same, but rather two different representations of Tetris-like blocks.</p>
