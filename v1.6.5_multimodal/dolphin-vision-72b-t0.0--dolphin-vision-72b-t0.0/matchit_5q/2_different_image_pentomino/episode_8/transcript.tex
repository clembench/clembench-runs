There are red, yellow, purple, and orange colors used in the blocks, with varying sizes and orientations.

Additionally, the presence of shadows or depth cues in the comparison image that suggest volume is a distinct difference from the flat, two-dimensional appearance of the pieces in the image I described. These differences indicate that the images are not the same, but rather two different representations of Tetris-like blocks.
