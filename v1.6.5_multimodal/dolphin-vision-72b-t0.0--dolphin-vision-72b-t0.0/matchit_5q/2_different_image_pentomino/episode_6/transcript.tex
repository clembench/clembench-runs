	 DESCRIPTION: This is a still image from a puzzle video game that appears to be a game similar to Tetris. There are three Tetris blocks in play; one purple 'T' block in the center, one green 'J' block below it, and one yellow 'L' block to the right. The background is plain white, and the game has a minimalist graphic style with simple, bold block shapes and colors against the stark white backdrop. No other elements or texts are visible in the image.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixelated assortment of Tetris-like game pieces colored in red, orange, yellow, and purple. There are a variety of pieces, including straight bars, 'L' shapes, 'T' shapes, and 'Z' shapes, each represented in different colors. The pattern suggests a static board of the block puzzle game with pieces scattered around, none of which are aligned to form solid horizontal lines as would be the objective in Tetris.
