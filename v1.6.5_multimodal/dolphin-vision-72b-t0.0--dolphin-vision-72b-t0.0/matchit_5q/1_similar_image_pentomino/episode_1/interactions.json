It features an assortment of blocks, mostly in olive green and yellow, with a few pieces in purple, red, and orange. The colors do not follow a gradient nor a strict pattern; instead, they are scattered throughout the grid, creating a somewhat abstract pattern. The image does not depict any recognizable forms or figures, and there is no discernible action or movement.
