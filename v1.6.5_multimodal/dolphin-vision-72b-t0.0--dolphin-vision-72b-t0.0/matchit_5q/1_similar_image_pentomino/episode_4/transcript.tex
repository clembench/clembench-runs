	 The question seems to be about a collaborative guessing game, where the goal is to determine if two separate images match. Since one of the images cannot be described by me due to its nature, I'll describe the image I can see and leave any further inquiries to you.\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: The image contains a collection of Tetris-shaped pieces in various colors, including purple, green, orange, and two shades of pink. The shapes are irregularly arranged on a white background. Each piece is a solid color with a grid layout, resembling the iconic Tetris game blocks.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, I invite you to provide your description of the image you have, so we can begin the process of determining if the images are the same.
