From top to bottom, there is a purple cross (T-piece), two olive-green Tetris Ts, a pink Tetris Z or S piece, and two golden yellow Tetris Us or backwards Ls at the bottom. The Tetris pieces have a simplistic, block-like design characteristic of early video game graphics, with colors that contrast against the white background.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image displays a Tetris-like arrangement of six distinct shapes, each color-coded and numbered with a plus sign, set against a white background. The shapes are not arranged in a grid but seem to be placed randomly. The plus signs are at the center of each shape, and the colors and numbers represent some sort of coding or categorization.

The Tetris pieces have a simplistic, block-like design characteristic of early video game graphics, with colors that contrast against the white background.\\ \tt Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my image that may be different to your image.
