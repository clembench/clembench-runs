        <p>ANSWER:<br/>The specific arrangement of the colored shapes that make up the word &quot;HAPPY&quot; in my image consists of intersecting &quot;X&quot; and &quot;P&quot; shapes. The arrangement is quite straightforward, with the first two letters, H and A, made from intersecting plus shapes arranged vertically, then the P, which is a smaller plus-like shape, and the Y, which is an upside-down &quot;V&quot; shape. They are interconnected to form a grid-like pattern that collectively spell out &quot;HAPPY.&quot;</p>
