	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a series of geometric shapes and lines in various colors, resembling a simplistic art or iconography. The main elements include a green checkmark, orange zigzag lines, a pink plus sign, and a gray minus sign. Each icon is distinct and separated from the others. The background is plain white, and there's no text or detailed imagery. The icons are simple and symbolic in nature.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the given information, the task is to determine if the iconography in this image matches that of another image which is not shown here. To assist you in determining whether these two images are the same, I would require more details on your image. Please describe your image clearly, focusing on the color, shape, and number of elements present, and whether there is any text or additional details that could help in identifying the images as the same or different.
