The adult elephant is distinguishably larger and is positioned towards the right side of the image, with its trunk extended to the ground. The smaller elephant, presumably the calf, is to the left and appears to be in motion. Both elephants have a greyish-brown skin tone, and the adult elephant has tusks. The background is a bright blue, suggesting a clear, possibly sunny day, with the blue also indicating the sky above the plain, which stretches out across the image with no visible landmarks or human structures."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-21T09:01:56.808238", "action": {"type": "valid format", "content": "continue"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "Player 2", "timestamp": "2024-08-21T09:01:56.808291", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\nThe goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.\nPlease describe your image first.
