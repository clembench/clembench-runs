	 DESCRIPTION: The image is taken at an outdoor Asian produce market. It shows a woman who appears to be a vendor, selecting produce, surrounded by an array of vegetables and fruits including bananas. The market setting is urban, with a utilitarian look given the presence of stacked cardboard boxes and commercial bins. The colors are natural and vibrant, with the greens of the vegetables and the yellows of the bananas standing out. Notable features include the assortment of leafy greens and the neatly arranged produce. There are no texts visible in this image.
