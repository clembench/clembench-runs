From left to right, there's a purple cross shape, an orange rectangle with a corner cut off, and a pink horizontal rectangle. Next to these, a green inverted L-shape, a yellow reverse L-shape, an orange L-shape, a pink straight line, and finally a pink box with a bite taken out of one corner. There is no text or additional context given in the image. The blocks vary in size and are oriented with different rotation angles. The colors are distinct and the shapes are simple, evoking a childlike or game-like quality. The image is minimalist with a clean aesthetic. </start"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T07:11:56.698838", "action": {"type": "invalid format", "content": "abort, first word: <start"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T07:11:56.698872", "action": {"type": "Game over", "content": "Aborted"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-08-22T07:11:56.698895", "action": {"type": "Game over", "content": "Aborted"}}]]}
