The letters are separated by small, white spaces. The color selection is uniform within each letter, and the background is plain white, providing a stark contrast to the colorful letters. The image appears to be digital, resembling a style that might be associated with early digital art or pixel art.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a digital rendering featuring two distinct figures against a solid light green background. The left side of the image presents a large, purple plus sign.

The figures are separate and there is no overlap between them.\\ \tt \\ \tt It's important to note that this description is based solely on the visible elements in the image and does not include any perceived or implied information beyond what is explicitly shown.
