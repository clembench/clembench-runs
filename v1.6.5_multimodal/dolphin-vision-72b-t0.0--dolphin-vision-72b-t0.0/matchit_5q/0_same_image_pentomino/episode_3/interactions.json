The colors used are purple for the 'P', orange and green for the 'T', with two additional small blocks in light blue and green. The blocks are in the positions typically used in Tetris gameplay, where the 'P' is centered and the 'T' is to the right, slightly offset. The background is white, which highlights the colors of the blocks. The arrangement of the blocks is such that they interlock, as per the rules of Tetris.\n\nI have described the primary elements, layout, and specific details of my image.
