	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short image description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

	 I will provide you a short description of my picture, and then it will be your turn to compare it with your image:\\ \tt \\ \tt DESCRIPTION: The image is composed of a two-dimensional grid with colored tetrominoes from Tetris arranged in a way that they spell out the letters "PT". The colors used are purple for the 'P', orange and green for the 'T', with two additional small blocks in light blue and green. The blocks are in the positions typically used in Tetris gameplay, where the 'P' is centered and the 'T' is to the right, slightly offset. The background is white, which highlights the colors of the blocks. The arrangement of the blocks is such that they interlock, as per the rules of Tetris.\\ \tt \\ \tt I have described the primary elements, layout, and specific details of my image. It is now your turn to provide a description of your image. Please exclude any potential personal information or copyrighted material. After your description, we can determine if the images match based on the described content.
