	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a small, round wooden table with a red leather handbag resting on top. There are decorative items on the table, such as a wooden bowl, a framed artwork, and a glass candle holder with a lit candle. Additionally, there are three glass decorative pieces with varying shapes and colors, along with a card that features a drawing of a tree and text. The setting seems to be a room with a wooden floor and a glimpse of a chair in the background.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, it's your turn to provide your description and then we can proceed with asking questions to determine if the images are the same.
