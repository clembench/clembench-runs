	 ANSWER: There are no harsh shadows or strong indications of the position of the sun that would suggest a specific time of day beyond it being daytime. The lighting is diffused, likely due to the partly cloudy sky, and this softness does not clearly define the time of day. The absence of long shadows indicates it is neither early morning nor late afternoon.
