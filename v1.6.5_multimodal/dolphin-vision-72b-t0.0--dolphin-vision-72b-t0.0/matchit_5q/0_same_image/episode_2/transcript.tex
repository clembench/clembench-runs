	 DESCRIPTION: This is an image of a residential kitchen, which is traditionally styled with modern appliances. The color scheme is predominantly light, with bright walls and cabinetry, contrasting with the dark hardwood floor. The presence of a stainless steel refrigerator, a gas stove with an oven, and a dishwasher indicate modern amenities within a classic design. There is a central island with a glass fronted cabinet and a wooden countertop. The layout is designed for easy movement and includes built-in seating at the island. Natural light is abundant, complementing the warm tone of the room. The kitchen is well-equipped and appears ready for use with all essentials in place.
