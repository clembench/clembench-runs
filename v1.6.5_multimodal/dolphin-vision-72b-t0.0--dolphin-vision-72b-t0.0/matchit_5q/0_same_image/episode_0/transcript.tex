	 DESCRIPTION: The image features a single reddish-brown horse with a distinctive white stripe on its nose, standing in a mountainous landscape. The mountains appear to be snowy peaks, indicating a higher altitude or colder climate. The horse's gaze is directed towards the left of the frame, and the surrounding area is rocky with sparse vegetation. The sky is filled with clouds, suggesting either an overcast day or the early morning or late afternoon light. There are no visible buildings or human-made objects, suggesting a natural, possibly wild setting. The photographer's watermark is the only text present, which does not affect the content of the image itself.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image features a solitary brown horse with a distinctive white blaze on its face, standing in a grassy field. The setting appears to be in a mountainous region, as evidenced by the rugged, snowy peaks of the mountains in the background. Above, the sky is overcast, lending a neutral color tone to the scene. The horse is positioned in the foreground, with no other animals or objects in immediate proximity. There are no visible human structures or paths, emphasizing the wild and natural environment. The horse's stance is relaxed, suggesting it is accustomed to this open space. The photograph seems to be taken during daylight with diffused lighting, likely due to the cloudy conditions, casting soft shadows.
