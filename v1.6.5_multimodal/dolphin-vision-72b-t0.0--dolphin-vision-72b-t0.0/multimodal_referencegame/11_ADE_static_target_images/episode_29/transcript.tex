	 The target image is a traditional dining room, characterized by its elegant wood furniture and a warm color scheme. It has a chandelier above the dining table and a fireplace in the background, which are not prominent features of the distractor images. The referring expression for the target image could be: "Expression: A traditional dining room featuring an elegant chandelier, a fireplace with a gold-topped mantelpiece, and hardwood floors with a beige carpet under a polished wooden table surrounded by classic wooden chairs."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression emphasizes the key elements that distinguish the target image from the distractors, which may not feature the same combination of elements such as the chandelier, fireplace, and the specific style of furniture.
