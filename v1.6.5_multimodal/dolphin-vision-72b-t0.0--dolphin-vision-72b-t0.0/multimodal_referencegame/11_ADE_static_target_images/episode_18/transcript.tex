	 To generate a referring expression that best describes the target image while distinguishing it from the two other distractor images, the description should capture the unique features present in the target image that are not in the distractors. An appropriate referring expression for the target image might be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A contemporary dining area with a dark wooden table surrounded by sleek white chairs and illuminated by a grey pendant light, featuring wall art with a red and white color scheme."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression points out the specific elements of the target image that set it apart from the distractor images, such as the materials of the furniture, the lighting, and the distinctive color scheme of the wall art. It omits any references to elements or themes that are not present or are significantly different in the target image, thus focusing on the unique qualities of the target setting.
