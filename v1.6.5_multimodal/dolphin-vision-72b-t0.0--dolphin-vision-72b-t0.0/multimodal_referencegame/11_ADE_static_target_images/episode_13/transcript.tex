	 The target image is characterized by a light and airy ambiance created by the use of neutral tones and soft lighting. The white chairs and light wood flooring contribute to the room's brightness, while the ornate detailing on the ceiling and fireplace mantle add a touch of elegance without overwhelming the space. The room is not cluttered, which enhances its welcoming and spacious feel. The target image features a clean, unadorned dining table that invites the viewer to imagine dining in this space. Notably, the target image lacks any distracting elements, such as additional furniture, decorative pieces, or personal items that could indicate a specific setting or use. The referring expression for this image could be: "Expression: A serene, light-filled dining room featuring unadorned elegance with neutral-toned furniture and understated decorative elements." This expression emphasizes the room's aesthetic and distinguishes it from potential distractor images that might have more clutter, brighter colors, or a less sophisticated design.
