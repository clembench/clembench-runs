This image appears to be the only one among the given three that matches the detailed description of a classic living space with vintage style and a round glass-topped dining table as a focal point. Therefore, based on the description provided, the number of the image that matches the expression would be the second image, assuming that the image I have described is indeed the second in the sequence.
