	 Answer: The first image provided matches the given referring expression. The description of the dining room as rustic yet elegant with light wood tones, a large rectangular table, and a set of six chairs aligns perfectly with the contents of the first image. Furthermore, the image shows an abundance of light, which could be interpreted as natural light, suggesting that the large window, potentially a glass door or sliding barn door mentioned in the expression, is out of view. Therefore, the correct selection would be the first image.
