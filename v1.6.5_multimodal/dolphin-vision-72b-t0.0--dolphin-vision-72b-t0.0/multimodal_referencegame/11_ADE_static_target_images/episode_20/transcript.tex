	 The image that matches the given referring expression is the first image. This is because it features the elegant dining room as described, with a round glass dining table at the center, surrounded by cushioned chairs in red and green, which aligns with the color scheme mentioned. The table is indeed on a patterned tile floor, and the natural light is evident from the window blinds, giving the room an airy feel. The traditional lantern-style chandeliers are situated above the table, confirming the room's classic aesthetic described in the expression. Therefore, the answer is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: First Image
