	 The target image features a rectangular grid of 3 columns with 8 rows, making a total of 24 smaller rectangles. The arrangement is consistent and orderly, resembling a blank score sheet or a puzzle grid. There is an additional element of design where the upper right corner of the target image includes a grid pattern composed of four squares with diagonal lines, differentiating it from the plain layout of the rest of the image. This pattern does not appear in the other images, which are uniform grids without any additional markings. The unique feature of the target image's design, along with the larger grid size, provides a clear contrast to the distractor images.\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: The target image is a grid with 24 blank rectangles, distinguished by a unique 'X' pattern in the top right corner.
