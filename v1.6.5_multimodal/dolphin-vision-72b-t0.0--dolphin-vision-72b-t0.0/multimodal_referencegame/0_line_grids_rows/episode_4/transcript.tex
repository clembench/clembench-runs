	 The target image is characterized by a grid where every other square is filled with an "X" pattern. This creates a clear checkered pattern across the entire image. To distinguish the target from the distractors, one would focus on this checkered appearance. Therefore, the referring expression for the target image starting with the tag "Expression: " would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A grid filled with alternating squares, where every other square contains an 'X' symbol, creating a checkerboard pattern."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression avoids any ambiguity by emphasizing the uniform pattern of alternating squares and the specific placement of the "X" symbols, which distinguishes it from any potential distractors.
