	 The referring expression for the given target image should encapsulate its unique characteristics that set it apart from the distraction images. Given the simplicity of the image, the expression focuses on the distinct features that match the description of the target. Here's how I can create an expression for the target image:\\ \tt \\ \tt - I'll describe the object's color, texture, and form, as these are the most likely elements that would be different from a distractor image.\\ \tt - I'll avoid any subjective or aesthetic descriptions, focusing on objective characteristics.\\ \tt - The expression will serve to clearly distinguish the target from similar elements in the other two images.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, let's put this into an actual expression starting with the tag "Expression: ".\\ \tt \\ \tt ---\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: [Based on the description provided, I'll craft a specific and objective referring expression that serves to identify the distinct features of the described image.]\\ \tt \\ \tt To provide you with an accurate response, I'll need the specific description of the target image as well as the distractor images. Please provide the details, and I will generate the referring expression as per your instructions.
