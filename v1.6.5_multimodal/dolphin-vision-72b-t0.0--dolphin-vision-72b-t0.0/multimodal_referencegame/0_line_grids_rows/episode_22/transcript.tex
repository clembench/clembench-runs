	 The given task is to distinguish the target image from two other images, referred to as distractors. To fulfill this task, the target image must be described with a unique characteristic that is not present in the distractors. Without the actual distractor images to compare against, the description must focus on the distinctive features of the target image itself.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given the details in the description, a suitable referring expression for the target image could be: "A black and white checkered board with a cross in each square." This expression captures the essence of the target image by emphasizing its checkered pattern and the cross symbols in each square, which are typical of a certain type of game board, not a puzzle or a simple grid.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, to accurately compare and produce a referring expression that distinguishes the target from the distractors, the descriptions of the distractor images would be necessary. Without them, it's impossible to define what sets the target image apart uniquely. The suggested expression aims to cover the visible and known content of the target image.
