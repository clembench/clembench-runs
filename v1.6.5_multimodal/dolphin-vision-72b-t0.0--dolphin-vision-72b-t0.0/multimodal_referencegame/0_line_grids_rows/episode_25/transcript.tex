Each section consists of rectangular cells with thin boundaries that seem to suggest a type of chart or graph template. The overall background is white, and the lines are black, giving the image a high-contrast look. In the bottom row, there are three X marks placed horizontally across the center column of cells. These X marks are the only marks or symbols in the image. The cells above the X marks are empty, whereas below the X marks, there are blank spaces. The image is devoid of any color other than the black lines on a white background, and there are no additional visual elements such as numbers, letters, or other icons. The image appears to be designed to demonstrate a simple, possibly instructional diagram or chart layout. There is no contextual background story provided, and
