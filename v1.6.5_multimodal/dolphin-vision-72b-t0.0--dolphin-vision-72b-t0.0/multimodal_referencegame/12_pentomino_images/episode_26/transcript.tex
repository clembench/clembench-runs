	 The expression for the target image would focus on distinguishing its characteristics from the distractors. The target image's notable feature is its color combination of blue and red, which differs from the other images. Additionally, its shapes are the most unique compared to the other images, which have more repetitive patterns. Therefore, the referring expression could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: the unique arrangement of blue and red shapes, differing from the repetitive patterns and color schemes of the distractor images."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression encapsulates the unique colors and shapes of the target image while differentiating it from the other images that have either a brown color scheme (as in the first distractor) or a blue theme with a more repetitive pattern (as in the third distractor).
