	 Answer: The given expression describes the third image. It matches the described digital mosaic composed of squares in the colors of yellow, red, and purple arranged in a seemingly random pattern on a white background. The mention of yellow squares being most prevalent and centered around a larger yellow square that resembles a rotated T-shape corresponds to the central element in the third image. Therefore, the image that matches the given expression is the third.
