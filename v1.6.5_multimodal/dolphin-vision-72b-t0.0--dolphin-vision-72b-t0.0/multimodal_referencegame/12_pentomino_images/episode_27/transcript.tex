	 The target image is distinguished by its green and purple coloration and is located in the center-left of the composition. The referring expression for the target image could be: "Expression: Central plus sign with green and purple segments, flanked by other plus signs of differing colors and arrangements." This expression highlights the central position of the target, its unique color combination, and its differing arrangement compared to the distractors, which helps in distinguishing it from the other two images.
