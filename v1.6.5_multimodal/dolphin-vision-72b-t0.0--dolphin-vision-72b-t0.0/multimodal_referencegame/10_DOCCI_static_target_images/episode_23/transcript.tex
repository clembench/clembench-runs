	 The target image is of a realistic dog sculpture with human-like qualities, such as standing on its hind legs and dressed in a costume. It is characterized by its white fur with a distinctive dark spot on its back and a green tie. The sculpture is also holding a sign that reads "HOPPY." This description stands out from the distractor images, which might not feature a dog or a similarly posed figure. This image is likely to be placed in a public area for artistic or commercial purposes, as suggested by the sign and its location beside a street. The referring expression for the target image, which distinguishes it from the other two images, would be: "A standing dog statue with a green tie holding a HOPPY sign."
