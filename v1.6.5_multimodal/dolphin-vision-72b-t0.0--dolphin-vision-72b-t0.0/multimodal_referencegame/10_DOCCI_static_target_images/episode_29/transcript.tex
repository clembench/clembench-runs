	 The provided expression aligns with the image described, where a grey cat is shown in a defensive posture against a second cat with a brown tabby coat and a blue collar. The first cat's body is arched, and its paws are extended, which is indicative of defensive play. The setting and the presence of domestic furniture in the background, along with the motion blur, suggest the spontaneous nature of the scene. Therefore, the image that matches the given referring expression is the one provided with the question. It's the first and only image in this context.\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: 1
