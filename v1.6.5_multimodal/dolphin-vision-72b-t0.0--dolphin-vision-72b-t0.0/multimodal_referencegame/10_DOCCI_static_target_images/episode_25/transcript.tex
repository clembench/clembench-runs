	 The referring expression for the target image should encapsulate the distinctive features that set it apart from the distractors. Since the task specifies describing the target image while distinguishing it from two distractors, the expression should highlight unique elements such as the dog's coat color, body language, and the specific setting presented. \\ \tt \\ \tt Given that this image is a target and not a distractor, the expression to describe it could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A vigilant light tan dog with short fur and darker paws, attentively standing on sandy ground beside a weathered metal wall with visible dents."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression focuses on the dog's coloration, posture, and the immediate environment, which may differ from the characteristics of the distractors. Without the images of the distractors to compare, the expression aims to be descriptive and specific to the target image.
