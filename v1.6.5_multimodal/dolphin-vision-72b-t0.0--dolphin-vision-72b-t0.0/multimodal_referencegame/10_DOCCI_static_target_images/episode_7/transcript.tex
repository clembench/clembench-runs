	 The expression provided mentions a dog with "striking blue eyes" standing on a "wooden platform." The image in question, however, depicts a black and brown dog with brown eyes, and it is not standing on a wooden platform but is positioned near a window. None of the other images are provided to compare, but based on the description given, the image presented does not match the referring expression as it does not feature a dog with blue eyes or a wooden platform setting. Therefore, the image provided is not the one referred to in the question.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that the expression provided does not match the image shown, and without the ability to compare with the other two images, an accurate selection based on the given description cannot be made. However, if we were to disregard the discrepancy in the expressions, the image in focus would be considered as the first image due to its singular presentation in this context.
