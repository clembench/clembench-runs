	 The expression refers to an image that is not described by the provided image. The mural in the image is of a wolf, not a small, shaggy-furred dog. The referring expression describes a scene where a dog is looking into a window, which does not match any component of the mural or the surroundings in the image. Therefore, based on the given description, none of the images match the referring expression. If the three images are different from what was provided in the question, the image that matches the expression would be the one depicting a small, shaggy-furred dog with the described features. However, with the image presented, there is no match to the referring expression.
