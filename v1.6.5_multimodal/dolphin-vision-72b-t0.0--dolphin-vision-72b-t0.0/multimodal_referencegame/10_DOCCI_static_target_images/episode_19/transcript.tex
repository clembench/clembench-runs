	 The given expression does not match any of the three images described, as it refers to a scene of a dog drinking water from a mirror-like pond, a scenario that is not depicted in any of the images. The provided images are of urban landscapes, not natural settings with bodies of water. Therefore, based on the information given, none of the images match the referring expression. If the expression is meant to describe one of the images provided, there seems to be a discrepancy, and the expression is not accurately describing the contents of any of the images. Therefore, it is not possible to select any of the images based on the expression given. The question seems to be based on a misunderstanding, as the expression cannot be accurately attributed to any of the images presented.
