	 Without the three images provided, I cannot directly correlate the expression to one of them. However, based on the detailed description provided in the question, the image referred to seems to be a work of art, specifically a graffiti piece on an outdoor wall featuring a dog. This description suggests a scene different from the domestic interior setting of the image provided. To accurately answer the question, I would need the three given images to match the referring expression. Since the image I've described does not match the expression's criteria, I am unable to provide a selection without the additional images.
