It appears to be a simplified or abstract representation of a chessboard without any pieces on it. The grid has alternating white and black rectangles, and two distinct patterns are visible. The upper pattern consists of a solid X made of four interconnected squares, one in each of the corners of the grid. The background beneath this pattern has a darker tone than the other areas. The lower pattern is made up of several smaller X shapes distributed across the lower half of the grid, with these smaller X marks also having a slightly darker shade than the other squares. Each X is composed of two intersecting diagonal lines. There are no other objects or text in
