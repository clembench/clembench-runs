	 The given task is to create a referring expression for the target image that distinguishes it from the two distractor images. However, only one image has been provided to describe. Without the additional two images, it is not possible to generate an expression that compares the target image to other different images because there are no distractor images presented here to provide contrast or context. \\ \tt \\ \tt The referring expression typically serves to uniquely identify an object or concept by emphasizing its distinctive features compared to others it might be confused with. In this case, with only one image at hand, we would simply describe the image provided. Therefore, an appropriate expression, focusing solely on this image, would be: \\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A rectangular grid game board with a central X in the middle row and X's in the first column."
