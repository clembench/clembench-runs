	 Expression: A grid with 3 columns and 4 rows, featuring a pattern of two crosses in the second and fourth columns at the top and bottom, with an additional cross in the second column's third row.\\ \tt This referring expression highlights the unique arrangement of crosses within the grid which distinguishes this target image from the two distractors. It specifies the number of columns and rows for clarity and points out the positions of the crosses, which is essential to differentiate this specific pattern from others that might have different placements or arrangements of crosses.
