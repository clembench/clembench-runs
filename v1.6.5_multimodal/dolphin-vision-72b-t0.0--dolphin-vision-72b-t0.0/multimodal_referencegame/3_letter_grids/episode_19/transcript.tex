	 To generate a referring expression that best describes the target image while distinguishing it from the distractor images, one must focus on unique elements present in the target image. Since the target is the first image, which contains a singular letter 'X' in the center cell, the distinguishing feature can be identified as the presence of this single letter 'X'. This unique placement differentiates the target from the other two images, which cannot be described if they are not provided to the AI. Thus, the referring expression for the target image could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A square grid with a central placement of a single 'X'."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression captures the essence of the target image without referring to any other elements or images, and it is specific enough to differentiate the target from any possible distractors.
