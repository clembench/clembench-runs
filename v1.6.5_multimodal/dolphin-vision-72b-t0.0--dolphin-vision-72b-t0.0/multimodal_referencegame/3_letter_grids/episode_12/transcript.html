    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>&lt;start of description&gt;<br/>The image displays a plain black and white composition of a rectangular grid. The grid consists of 4 rows and 6 columns. Within this grid, certain cells are marked with black &#x27;X&#x27;s. In the top row, there is a single &#x27;X&#x27; in the second cell. The bottom row contains two &#x27;X&#x27;s, placed in the second and fifth cells. The pattern of &#x27;X&#x27;s in the second column starts at the top row and continues down to the bottom row, while the fifth column only has one &#x27;X&#x27; in the bottom row. This creates a distinct pattern that could be used for identification. There are no other symbols or structures present in the grid. The background is a stark white, and the grid lines are a clear, solid black, providing a strong contrast that emphasizes the marked cells. The overall impression is of a simple, uncluttered design.</p>
