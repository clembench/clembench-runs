	 <start of description>\\ \tt The image displays a plain black and white composition of a rectangular grid. The grid consists of 4 rows and 6 columns. Within this grid, certain cells are marked with black 'X's. In the top row, there is a single 'X' in the second cell. The bottom row contains two 'X's, placed in the second and fifth cells. The pattern of 'X's in the second column starts at the top row and continues down to the bottom row, while the fifth column only has one 'X' in the bottom row. This creates a distinct pattern that could be used for identification. There are no other symbols or structures present in the grid. The background is a stark white, and the grid lines are a clear, solid black, providing a strong contrast that emphasizes the marked cells. The overall impression is of a simple, uncluttered design.
