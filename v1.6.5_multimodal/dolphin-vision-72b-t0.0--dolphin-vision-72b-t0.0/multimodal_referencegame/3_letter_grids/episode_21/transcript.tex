	 To generate a referring expression that best describes the target image, we must focus on its unique features that distinguish it from the distractor images. Given that the target image and one of the distractors may be identical or very similar, the challenge is to find subtle distinctions. If differences are not visually apparent, the details provided must rely on other attributes, such as the intended use or the context of the image. The expression should clearly convey what makes this image unique compared to the distractors.\\ \tt \\ \tt  expression: A monochrome grid with seven squares marked with an "X", likely representing an initial game setup where "O"s are yet to be entered, distinct from the other images by its untouched, symmetrical nature.
