	 The referring expression describes a 7x3 grid with a black plus symbol in the center cell. The only image that has a grid structure is the second one. However, the second image does not have a plus symbol in the center cell; instead, it shows a single cross in the top row. The first and third images are photographs unrelated to the structure of the expression. Since none of the images match the referring expression exactly, it appears there is a discrepancy between the description and the available images. However, the most relevant image based on the grid structure would still be the second one.\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: Second
