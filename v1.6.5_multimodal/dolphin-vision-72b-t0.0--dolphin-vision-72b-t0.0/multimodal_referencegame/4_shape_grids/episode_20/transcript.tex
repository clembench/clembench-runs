	 The referring expression for the target image should capture its unique features while differentiating it from the distractor images. Given the nature of the image, a suitable referring expression could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: An uninterrupted grid with a symmetrical pattern of crosses at the centers of each square."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression highlights the uniform cross pattern that is spread across the entire grid, which distinguishes it from the second and third images where the pattern or the number of crosses might differ or be incomplete. It emphasizes the target image's continuity and uniformity as its distinguishing features.
