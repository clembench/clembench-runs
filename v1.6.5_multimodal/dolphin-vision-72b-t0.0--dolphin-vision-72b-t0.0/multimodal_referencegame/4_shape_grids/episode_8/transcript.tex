	 The expression provided accurately describes the image in question. It refers to an image that is grayscale, a characteristic indicated by the use of black X marks against a white grid background. The image features a symmetrical pattern, as the X marks are equally distributed around the edges of the grid and also form a border around a central square area without any marks. This central void is a distinctive feature of the pattern. The expression also notes the simplicity and monochromatic nature of the design, setting it apart from other images that might contain more complex elements or coloration. Based on the description provided and the characteristics of the image, the image that matches the given expression is the first image. Hence:\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: first
