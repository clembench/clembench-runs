	 The task involves generating a referring expression for the target image that differentiates it from the two distractor images. As the images have not been presented, the following is a hypothetical example of how a referring expression for a target image could be created:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: The target image is distinguished by its unique pattern of black and white stripes, arranged in an alternating fashion, reminiscent of a zebra's hide. It lacks the geometric uniformity of the first distractor image and the pixelated appearance of the second distractor."\\ \tt \\ \tt Please upload the images so that I can accurately describe the target image and distinguish it from the distractor images.
