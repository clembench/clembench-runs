	 The second image, which serves as a distractor, differs from the target image primarily in the distribution and alignment of the Xs. The third image, also a distractor, exhibits a pattern where the Xs are placed in a diagonal line from the bottom right to the top left of the grid. The target image, however, has a distinct pattern where the Xs are positioned in a vertical alignment, creating a striking difference from the pattern in the second image and the diagonal pattern in the third image. Therefore, the referring expression that best describes the target image while distinguishing it from the two other distractor images would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A monochromatic rectangular grid with black Xs aligned vertically in every third column, creating a repeating pattern that starkly differs from the horizontal alignment of Xs in the second image and the diagonal pattern of Xs in the third image."
