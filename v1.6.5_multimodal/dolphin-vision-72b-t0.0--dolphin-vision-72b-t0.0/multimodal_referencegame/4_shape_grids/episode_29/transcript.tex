	 Answer: The expression refers to the third image. This is the only image out of the given three (with only one image visible) that matches the description provided in the referring expression. It shows the specific 'T' shape in the first column, the smaller 'T' in the center, and the reversed 'L' shape spanning the third and fourth columns. There is a distinct pattern of 'X' symbols that fits the description exactly.
