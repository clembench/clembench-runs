	 The tag "Expression: " should be followed by a description that encapsulates the unique characteristics of the target image as a pattern of "X"s on a grid. In this case, the referring expression for the target image could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A structured grid with a diagonal pattern of 'X's."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression differentiates the target image from the distractors by highlighting its pattern and structure while remaining neutral and factual. It does not include any subjective interpretation or additional context that could be seen as unnecessary or off-topic. It is succinct and directly describes the visual content of the target image, aligning with the task's requirements.
