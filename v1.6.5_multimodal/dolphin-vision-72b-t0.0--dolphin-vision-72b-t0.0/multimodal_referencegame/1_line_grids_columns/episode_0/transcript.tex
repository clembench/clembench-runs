	 The referring expression for the given target image should encapsulate its unique characteristics that distinguish it from the distractor images. Since the actual second and third images haven't been provided, I can only describe elements present in the target image. Therefore, a potential referring expression could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A grid of squares representing a checkerboard pattern with a single X in the top left square."\\ \tt \\ \tt This description focuses on the most distinctive feature of the image—the presence of the X—and the checkerboard grid, which would help in distinguishing it from any other images that lack these elements.
