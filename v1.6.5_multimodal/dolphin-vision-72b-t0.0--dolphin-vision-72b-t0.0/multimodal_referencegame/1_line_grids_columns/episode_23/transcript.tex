	 Based on the provided expression, it appears that the task is to identify an image with a specific pattern and distinguish it from other images that do not match this description. Since only one image is provided, it is the image that the expression refers to. The expression mentions a "16-cell grid" with a specific pattern in the "first row and third column," while the rest of the cells are "blank." This description fits the image shown, with the X pattern in the specified cells and the remaining cells being blank. Therefore, the number of the image that matches the given expression is "1," as it is the only image presented.
