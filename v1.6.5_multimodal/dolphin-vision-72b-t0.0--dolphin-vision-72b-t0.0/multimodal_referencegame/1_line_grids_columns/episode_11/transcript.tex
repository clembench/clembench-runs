	 The task is to describe the target image while distinguishing it from the other two distractor images. The referring expression for the target image should capture the essence that differentiates it from the distractors. Since the distractors are not described, they cannot influence the description directly. However, the expression for the target should be specific enough that if the distractors were significantly different, it would not apply to them.\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: The target image is a grid layout of squares containing a scattered pattern of dark diagonal crosses, with a consistent border framing the layout, and it is displayed against a plain light background.
