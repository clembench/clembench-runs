	 The referring expression for the target image would be: "A 5x4 grid of alternating shaded and unshaded squares starting with a shaded square in the top left corner." This description focuses on the key visual feature of the target image, which is the alternating pattern of shaded and unshaded squares that distinguishes it from the distractor images, where no such pattern is present. It's also important to note that the first square, which in this context would be the top left corner, begins with a shaded square, which is a specific detail that was not asked for but is necessary to accurately describe the pattern.
