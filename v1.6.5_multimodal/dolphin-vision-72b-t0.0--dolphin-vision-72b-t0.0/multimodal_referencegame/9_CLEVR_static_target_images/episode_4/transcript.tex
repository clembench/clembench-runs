	 The task requires generating a referring expression that captures the essence of the target image while differentiating it from two distractor images. To accomplish this, we would focus on unique attributes present in the target image that are not shared with the distractor images. The target is described as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt **Expression:** The target image is a colorful collage on a city street, characterized by its mix of geometric and organic shapes in vivid colors. This image stands out with its combination of a vintage bicycle, a potted plant, and a city background, distinct in both aesthetic and thematic elements from the other images.\\ \tt \\ \tt This description aims to pinpoint the specific attributes of the target image, noting the combination of elements that are not present in the distractor images. It avoids any subjective opinions and sticks to observable facts. The intention is to create a clear and unambiguous reference to the target image, providing a solid basis for distinguishing it from the distractors.
