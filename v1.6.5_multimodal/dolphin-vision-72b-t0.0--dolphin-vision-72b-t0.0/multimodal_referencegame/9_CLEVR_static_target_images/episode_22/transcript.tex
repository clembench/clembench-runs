	 The term "referring expression" generally refers to a phrase that uniquely identifies an object or a group of objects within a given context. Since the question specifies that two images are distractors and one is the target, and the image described above fits the criteria of a distractor with its focus on various colorful geometric shapes, the task is to create a referring expression for the target that distinguishes it from this description. Unfortunately, without seeing the actual images, I cannot generate a specific referring expression that addresses the visual details unique to the target image. The process would involve identifying distinguishing features of the target image that differs from the distractor images, such as unique colors, shapes, textures, or any distinct features present in the target and not in the distractor images.
