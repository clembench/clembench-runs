	 The referring expression describes an image with a large blue cube as the central object, which is the most distinct feature based on its size and color. The mention of a gold cube and spheres provides additional clues to narrow down the selection to the correct image. Given the information and the elements present, the image that matches the referring expression is the first one in the sequence provided.\\ \tt \\ \tt Thus, the answer to the question is:\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: first
