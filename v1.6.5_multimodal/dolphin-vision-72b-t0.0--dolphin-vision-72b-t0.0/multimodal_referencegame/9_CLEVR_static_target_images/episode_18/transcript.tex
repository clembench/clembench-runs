	 Answer: The image that matches the given referring expression is the second one. This is based on the detailed description of the objects' colors, textures, and the presence of shadows which add depth to the scene. The shapes mentioned in the expression are clearly visible and match the corresponding objects in the second image, with the specified colors and finishes as described.
