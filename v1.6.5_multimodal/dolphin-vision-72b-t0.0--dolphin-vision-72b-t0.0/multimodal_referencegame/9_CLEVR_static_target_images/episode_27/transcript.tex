	 The referring expression describes the central object as a large blue matte cube, surrounded by smaller objects that include cylinders and a sphere. The blue cube's size relative to the other objects, its color, and its matte finish are highlighted, indicating that these are distinguishing features. Based on the description of the referring expression, the image that matches these criteria is the first image. Therefore, the number of the image that corresponds with the expression provided is "first."\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: first
