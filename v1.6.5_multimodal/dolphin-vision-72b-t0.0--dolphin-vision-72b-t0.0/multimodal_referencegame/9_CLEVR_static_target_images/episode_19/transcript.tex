	 The task involves creating a referring expression for the target image that sets it apart from two other distractor images. To describe the target image, one would focus on distinctive features such as color, size, reflectivity, and shape, which are unique compared to the other two images. Since I only see one image here, I can only infer a referring expression based on this single image. If the golden sphere is the target, considering its size, color, and reflectivity, the referring expression could be: "Expression: A large golden reflective sphere." This description highlights the sphere's size, color, and reflectivity, which are not exhibited by the cubes and would be useful in distinguishing it from a distractor image if they were different in these aspects.
