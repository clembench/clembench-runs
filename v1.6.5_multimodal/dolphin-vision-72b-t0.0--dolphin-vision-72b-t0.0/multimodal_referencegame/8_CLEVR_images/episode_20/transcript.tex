	 In the given task, the target image is the second one. To generate a referring expression that distinguishes the target from the two distractors, one would focus on the unique combination of shapes, colors, and textures that are presented in the target image that are not present in the first and third images. An appropriate expression might be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A group of geometric shapes with a combination of matte and reflective surfaces, including a large orange cube and a yellow sphere, contrasting against two smaller blue cylinders and a lone purple sphere."\\ \tt \\ \tt This referring expression includes distinctive features that exclusively exist in the target image, such as the specific color of the shapes and the presence of both reflective and matte surfaces, which are not present in the distractor images.
