	 The task is to generate a referring expression that describes the target image, which is the first image in the given sequence. To distinguish it from the two distractors, we need to focus on elements that are unique to this image. The image does not contain any overt signs of gender or race-related information, so the description will avoid such details. Instead, it will focus on the setting, attire, activity, and overall atmosphere of the image.\\ \tt \\ \tt The target image can be described as a serene urban morning scene, showcasing a diverse group of people engaging in various activities. Key characteristics include the presence of a sunny street, a variety of pedestrians with backpacks and shopping bags, diverse clothing styles, and architectural elements such as buildings and street signs. The expression captures the essence of a peaceful, diverse urban setting with individuals going about their early-day routines.\\ \tt \\ \tt Thus, the referring expression for the target image would be framed as follows: "Expression: A peaceful and diverse urban morning scene featuring pedestrians engaged in various activities, with a prominent sunny street, architectural elements, and a range of clothing styles."
