	 The referring expression for the given target image would focus on the unique pattern of crossed-out squares that differentiates it from the other two images, which may or may not share this characteristic. Therefore, the expression for the target image could be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A grid with an X-pattern in alternating rows and columns."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression specifically describes the target by mentioning the presence of an "X-pattern" formed by the intersecting lines in a series of diagonal squares, which is a key visual element distinguishing it from other images that could be potential distractors.
