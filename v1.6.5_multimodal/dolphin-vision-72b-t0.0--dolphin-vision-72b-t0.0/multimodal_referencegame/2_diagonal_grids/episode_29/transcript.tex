	 The task requires generating a referring expression that accurately describes the target image while differentiating it from the distractor images. Since the two distractor images were not provided, I can only describe the target image. The referring expression starting with the tag “Expression:” for the given target image is:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A neatly organized grid of cells with three central rows highlighted by 'X' marks, symbolizing a pattern or schedule, highlighted by a black border."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression emphasizes the characteristic features of the target image, such as the grid pattern, the X marks, and the absence of text or additional symbols, which would make it distinct from other potential images that might include different elements or designs.
