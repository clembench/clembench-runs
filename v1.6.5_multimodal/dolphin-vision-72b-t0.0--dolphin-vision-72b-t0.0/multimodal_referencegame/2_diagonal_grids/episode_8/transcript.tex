	 The referring expression describes an image with a grid of squares where the majority are shaded except for the central square. The shading pattern is consistent, either in the center or the corners, creating a visual rhythm. Since there are no images provided to compare against this description, I'm unable to determine which image matches the expression. Please provide the three images for comparison so that I can assist you further.
