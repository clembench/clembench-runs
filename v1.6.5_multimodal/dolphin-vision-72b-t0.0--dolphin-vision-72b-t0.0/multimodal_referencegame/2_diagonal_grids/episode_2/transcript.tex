The background is white. There are no other discernible elements. The grid appears to be a stylized way of representing the number nine using a 3x3 square of unit squares, each with the number '1' inside it. There is no text or other context that suggests a specific purpose beyond the abstract representation of the number. This image is the first, which has been identified as the target.
