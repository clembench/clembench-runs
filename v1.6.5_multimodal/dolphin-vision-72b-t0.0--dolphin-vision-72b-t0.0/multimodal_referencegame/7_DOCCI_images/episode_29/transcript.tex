	 The referring expression describes an airplane belonging to JetBlue Airways, characterized by its white body and distinctive blue tail. Given that the provided image is the only one described in this scenario, it logically serves as the matching image for the given expression. The details in the image—such as the branding, color scheme, and airport setting—correspond exactly to the features mentioned in the expression. Thus, the image matches the description perfectly.\\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: First
