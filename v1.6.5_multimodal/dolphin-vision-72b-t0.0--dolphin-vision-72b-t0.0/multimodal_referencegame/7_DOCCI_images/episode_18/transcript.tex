	 The task is to create a referring expression that captures the essence of the target image while setting it apart from the two distractor images. Since the distractor images have not been described, the referring expression will focus solely on the target image's unique features. The expression should effectively convey the artistic elements that make this mural distinctive.\\ \tt \\ \tt Considering the guidelines and the elements within the image, a suitable referring expression could be: "Expression: Mural of a serene black and white cat, seemingly floating on a cloud, next to a torn yellow triangle and a blue circle, set against a white brick wall, embodying a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression highlights the primary subject of the mural (the teddy bear), the specific colors and shapes present (the yellow triangle and blue circle), and the overall mood conveyed by the wall art (surreal and dreamlike atmosphere). It avoids mentioning other images to ensure the focus remains on the target image.
