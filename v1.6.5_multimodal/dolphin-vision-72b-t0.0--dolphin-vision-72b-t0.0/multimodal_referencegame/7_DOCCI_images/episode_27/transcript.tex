	 The target image features a commercial aircraft on the ground at an airport, ready for takeoff or having just landed. To distinguish it from the distractor images, the referring expression should focus on the key elements unique to the target image. The target and distractor images might share elements like aircraft, runways, and skies, but the target is set apart by certain distinct features. \\ \tt For example, you may say:\\ \tt "Expression: A commercial airplane at an airport, with visible aerodynamic design and branding, positioned centrally on an overcast day, indicating it is either about to take off or has just landed."\\ \tt This distinguishing description highlights the airplane's branding, the state of the sky, and the airplane's position, which may not be present in the distractor images.
