	 The target image depicts a small poodle characterized by its fluffy, cream-colored fur and a wistful expression. To distinguish it from other distractors, we can focus on its notable features: the fluffy fur, the coloration, the size, and the environment. Therefore, the referring expression that best describes the target image, while differentiating it from the other two images, would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: A small cream-colored poodle with fluffy fur, a red collar, and a soft gaze, standing on a path of rocks in a sunny outdoor garden setting."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression encapsulates the unique attributes of the poodle and its immediate environment, which sets it apart from the other images that may not share these characteristics.
