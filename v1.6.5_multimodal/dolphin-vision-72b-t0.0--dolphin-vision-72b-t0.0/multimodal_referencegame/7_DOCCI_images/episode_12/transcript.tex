	 The given image is the target object in a selection of three provided images. To distinguish it from the two distractors, the expression should focus on the unique features that are most prominent and distinguishable. Since the image provided appears to be a toy, the expression might emphasize the toy's color, material, and any unique characteristics such as the painted smiley face, which are not seen in the other images.\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: This is a black, glossy, bat-shaped toy with a silver stand, characterized by its happy, painted face.
