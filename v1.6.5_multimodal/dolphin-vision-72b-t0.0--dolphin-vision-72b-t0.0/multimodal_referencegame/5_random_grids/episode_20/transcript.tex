	 The task requires generating a referring expression that describes the target image and distinguishes it from the two distractor images. The referring expression should encapsulate the key visual elements that the target image possesses that are different from the distractor images.\\ \tt \\ \tt However, without the specific content of the distractor images, it is challenging to produce a precise expression that differentiates the target from them. If the distractor images contain some of the same elements—such as rectangles or circles—the distinguishing features must be chosen to differentiate the most visually prominent or unique characteristics in the target image.\\ \tt \\ \tt Based on the information given, the referring expression might be as follows: "Expression: This is the image with a singular pattern of dark squares arranged on a lighter background within a grid format." This description focuses on the unique layout and contrast of shapes and colors to set the target image apart from potential distractors that may have different patterns, shapes, or color schemes. However, without seeing the actual distractor images, the referring expression may need to be adjusted to more accurately reflect their dissimilarity.
