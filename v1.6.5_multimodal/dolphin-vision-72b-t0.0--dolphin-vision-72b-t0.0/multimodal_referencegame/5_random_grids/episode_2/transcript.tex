	 To generate a referring expression for the target image, one might consider the unique arrangement of crosses and blanks within the matrix. The target image is distinct because it has a symmetrical distribution of crosses and blanks. A referring expression that can help in distinguishing it from the distractors could be: "Expression: a grid with a pattern of alternating marked and unmarked squares, creating a symmetrical cross-filled X, starting from the top left and ending at the bottom right."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression focuses on the distinct pattern created by the crosses, which is a notable feature of the target image and absent in the distractors. The symmetrical arrangement is not present in the distractor images, which would not have a consistent pattern of crosses and blanks when moving diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of the grid.
