	 Answer: The expression refers to the first image. This conclusion is drawn from the specific locations of the 'X's as described: the second square of the top row, the fifth square of the middle row, and the second square of the bottom row. Additionally, the symmetry mentioned in the expression corresponds to the arrangement of 'X's in the first image when the grid is read from top to bottom.
