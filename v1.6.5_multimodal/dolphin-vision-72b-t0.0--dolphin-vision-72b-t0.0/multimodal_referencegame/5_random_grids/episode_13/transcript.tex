	 The referring expression for the target image should capture the unique features that distinguish it from the distractor images. Since the only distinguishing feature provided in the image is the presence of crosses, the referring expression will focus on this characteristic. Without additional context or images to compare to, the expression is derived based solely on the given image. \\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, the referring expression starting with the tag "Expression: " for the given target image would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "Expression: Four equally spaced crosses are placed within a larger rectangle, each within its own smaller square."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression emphasizes the number, spacing, and arrangement of the crosses, as well as their distinction from the larger rectangles.
