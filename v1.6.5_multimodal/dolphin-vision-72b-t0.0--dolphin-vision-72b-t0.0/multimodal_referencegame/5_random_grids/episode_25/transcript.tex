	 The task is to generate a referring expression that best describes the target image while distinguishing it from the two other distractor images. As the target image is described above, the referring expression should encapsulate these attributes distinctively, particularly focusing on the color palette and the prominent landmark.\\ \tt \\ \tt Hereâ€™s the referring expression for the given target image:\\ \tt "Expression: A panoramic view of New York City's skyline at dusk, bathed in warm hues of orange and pink, with the iconic Empire State Building standing out in the background."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression succinctly captures the essence of the target image by emphasizing the city's skyline, the time of day (sunset), and the distinctive presence of the Empire State Building, setting it apart from other images that might not share these specific characteristics.
