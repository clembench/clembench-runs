	 The given task is to generate a referring expression that describes the target image, which is the first image shown. A referring expression should be distinctive and enable someone to identify the target image without ambiguity among the three options provided.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given that the task involves distinguishing the images based on their content and assuming the content within the grid is unique to the target image, we would describe the target image as follows:\\ \tt \\ \tt Expression: "The target image features a blank grid with an atypical pattern of X's positioned in a diagonal sequence and with additional X's placed asymmetrically."\\ \tt \\ \tt This expression highlights the unique pattern within the grid that is not present in the distractor images, which would be the key to identifying the target image correctly.
