	 The grid contains a single 'X' in the center of the array of squares, which are arranged in a 5x5 pattern with an enclosed border. Based on the provided expression, the correct image should feature a central 'X' within a grid that is divided into 25 equal-sized squares. Since the expression specifies that there is only one 'X', we can exclude the images with additional markings. Therefore, the image that matches the given expression is the second image. This is because it shows a 5x5 grid with a single 'X' in the middle, fitting the exact description provided. \\ \tt \\ \tt Answer: second
