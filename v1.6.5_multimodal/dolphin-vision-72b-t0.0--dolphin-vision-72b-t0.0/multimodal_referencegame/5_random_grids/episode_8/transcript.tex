	 The image that matches the given referring expression is the second one. The expression specifies a target image featuring a symmetrical pattern of 'X's in three central rows, with one 'X' in each row. The second image in the series meets this description, with the 'X's centrally positioned and aligned, creating a symmetrical pattern across three rows.
