The image includes different shapes such as squares, rectangles, and T-shaped figures, each with its own distinct geometry. There is no single type or kind of shape that dominates the composition.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
