        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image is a simple digital graphic containing four colored blocks arranged diagonally. They are in a row, with each block a different shade: the first is a lighter shade, the second is darker, the third is slightly lighter than the second, and the fourth is the darkest shade. These blocks are not perfectly aligned and appear to have a random placement, giving the image an abstract, minimalist look.</p>
