	 DESCRIPTION: The image I'm describing consists of four pixelated figures arranged in a 2x2 grid. The top row contains two larger, blocky figures: one green and one purple, both shaped somewhat similarly to a T or cross. The bottom row has two smaller, more intricate figures: one is pink and the other is a series of orange blocks that resemble a staircase or a zigzag pattern. All figures are set against a plain white background.

	 DESCRIPTION: My image features a collection of pixelated Tetris pieces arranged without following a systematic pattern. The colors of the shapes are red, yellow, orange, and purple. The image is monochromatic, with each piece displaying its respective solid color without gradients or shading. There are no discernible patterns or textures within the colors, and the pieces seem to float with no overlapping, indicating there is no interaction between them. The pieces are not connected, and there is no indication of movement or interaction beyond their static placement. Given this information, we can compare the visual elements of my image with your description to determine the likelihood of the images being the same.
