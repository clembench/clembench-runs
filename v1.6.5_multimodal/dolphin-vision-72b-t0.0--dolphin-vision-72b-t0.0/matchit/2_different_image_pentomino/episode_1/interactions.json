The colors of the shapes are red, yellow, orange, and purple. The image is monochromatic, with each piece displaying its respective solid color without gradients or shading. There are no discernible patterns or textures within the colors, and the pieces seem to float with no overlapping, indicating there is no interaction between them. The pieces are not connected, and there is no indication of movement or interaction beyond their static placement.
