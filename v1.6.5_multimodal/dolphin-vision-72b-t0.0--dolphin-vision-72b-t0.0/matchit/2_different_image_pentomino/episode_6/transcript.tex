Its body is constructed from blocks of different colors: a deep purple head and trunk, a green and yellow body, an orange leg on the right, and a blue leg on the left, with an additional blue piece at the center of its body. The background is white, providing a stark contrast to the colorful pixel art. The entire image is made up of squares, which are placed adjacent to each other to form the image. There are no additional elements in the image.
