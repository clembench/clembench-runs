        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image is composed of pixel art forming the shape of an elephant. The elephant is facing left and is in a standing position. Its body is constructed from blocks of different colors: a deep purple head and trunk, a green and yellow body, an orange leg on the right, and a blue leg on the left, with an additional blue piece at the center of its body. The background is white, providing a stark contrast to the colorful pixel art. The entire image is made up of squares, which are placed adjacent to each other to form the image.

        <p>DECISION: different images. The pictures described have clear and distinct characteristics that do not match each other. One is an image of abstractly placed Tetris blocks with no identifiable pattern, and the other is a stylized, pixel art representation of an elephant with a specific arrangement of colors. The number of colors and the subject matter of the images are different, which indicates that these are two separate images.</p>
