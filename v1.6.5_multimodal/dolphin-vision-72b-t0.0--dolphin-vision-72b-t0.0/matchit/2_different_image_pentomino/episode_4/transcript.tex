	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixelated pattern with blocks arranged in a specific order. There are three columns of pixel blocks with alternating colors. The leftmost column starts with green, the middle with yellow, and the right with pink. In each column, the blocks are of different sizes and follow the order of purple, green, yellow, orange respectively. The arrangement does not form a recognizable shape or object but rather appears as a random or coded arrangement of colored squares.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a simple computer-generated arrangement of multicolored shapes, including triangles, a square, and four lines, in red, yellow, and blue, with some purple lines. They are placed with some shapes overlapping others on a plain white background. The arrangement does not follow any clear pattern or shape. The colors are bright and the shapes are basic geometric figures, suggesting an abstract or conceptual representation rather than a depiction of something concrete.

	 This is my DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixelated pattern with blocks arranged in a specific order. There are three columns of pixel blocks with alternating colors. The leftmost column starts with green, the middle with yellow, and the right with pink. In each column, the blocks are of different sizes and follow the order of purple, green, yellow, orange respectively. The arrangement does not form a recognizable shape or object but rather appears as a random or coded arrangement of colored squares.\\ \tt Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my image that may be different to your image. Start with "QUESTION:" and do not add anything else.

	 Based on the description provided, it seems that the image in question has a more ordered and deliberate pattern than the image I described. To further assess whether we have the same image, can you confirm if your image includes any shapes other than squares or rectangles? Also, are there any shapes that overlap others in your image?
