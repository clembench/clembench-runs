    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: The missing pieces in my image contribute to the overall design by creating a sense of an incomplete or disrupted message, which might suggest a hidden or obscured meaning. The arrangement of these missing blocks does not follow a simple, recognizable pattern; instead, it seems intentional to create a three-dimensional effect and to emphasize the individuality of each letter. The placement of these missing blocks appears to be strategically chosen to affect the interpretation of each letter.</p>
