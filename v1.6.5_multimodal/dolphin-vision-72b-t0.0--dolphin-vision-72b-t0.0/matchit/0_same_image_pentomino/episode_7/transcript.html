        <p>DECISION: different images. The images described vary in both the arrangement and the nature of the pixelated shapes. While my image consists of structured Tetris-like blocks with uniform outlines, the other described image features irregular, non-uniform shapes that overlap without a consistent form or silhouette. Additionally, the distribution of colors suggests a random scattering in the other image, whereas the blocks in my picture are distinct and separate with a more structured appearance.
