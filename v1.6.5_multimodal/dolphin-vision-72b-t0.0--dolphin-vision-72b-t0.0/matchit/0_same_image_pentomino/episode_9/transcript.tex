	 DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt The image displays several colorful Tetris-style blocks, each a different shape and color, laid out on a white background. There is a single red L-shaped block, a single yellow S-shaped block, and a single purple cross-shaped block. A single red square-shaped block, a single yellow T-shaped block, and a single purple line-shaped block are also present. Each block appears isolated with no overlap, and their placement does not form any larger shapes or patterns.

	 This is my DESCRIPTION: The image features pixelated letterforms that spell out "TETRIS" in capital letters. The first 'T' and the 'S' are red, the second 'T' is yellow, the 'R' is purple, and the 'I' is orange with a yellow outline. All the letters are bold and fill the space with no additional elements or background details.\\ \tt Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my image that may be different to your image. Start with "QUESTION:" and do not add anything else.

	 Based on your description, it seems that your image is more graphic-oriented with letterforms. In contrast, my image does not contain any letterforms or text, but rather individual Tetris blocks that are color-coded. A potential difference between the two images is the presence of text in your image and the absence of it in mine. Therefore, a question to further clarify the difference may be:\\ \tt \\ \tt "QUESTION: Are there any elements in your image other than the letterforms that could be interpreted as Tetris blocks, like separate shapes or lines?"
