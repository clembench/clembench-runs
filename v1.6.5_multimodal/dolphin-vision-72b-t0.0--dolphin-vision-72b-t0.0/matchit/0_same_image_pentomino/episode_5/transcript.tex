	 DESCRIPTION: The image consists of a simple line drawing of a house, colored in blue shades. It features three basic elements: a triangular roof, a rectangular body, and a small circular element that could be a window. The colors range from light to dark blue, and the background is a bright blue, possibly representing the sky. The drawing is rudimentary with no intricate details or textures.
