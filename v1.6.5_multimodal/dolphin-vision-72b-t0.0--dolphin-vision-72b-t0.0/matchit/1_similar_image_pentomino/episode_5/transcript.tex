There are four distinct shapes, including an orange straight segment, a purple cross shape, a green 'L' shape, and a pink 'T' shape. The colors appear to be flat and uniform, with no gradients. These shapes are arranged in a manner that suggests a possible Tetris game, where they could potentially interlock or be moved to form a complete row.
