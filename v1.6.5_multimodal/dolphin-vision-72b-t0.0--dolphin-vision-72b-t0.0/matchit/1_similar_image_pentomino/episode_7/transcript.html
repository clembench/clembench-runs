This might represent a snapshot of a Tetris game in progress, where players must connect pieces to complete squares and thus &#x27;fill in&#x27; the missing portions of the game pieces.

Additionally, the arrangement of the shapes and the nature of the colors (yours suggesting a fuller illustration with complete pieces, mine showing a process of completion) indicate that these are not the same image. <br/>DECISION: different images</p>
