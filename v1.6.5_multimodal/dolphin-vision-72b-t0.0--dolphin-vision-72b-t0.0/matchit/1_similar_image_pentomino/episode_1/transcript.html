        <p>ANSWER: In my image, the blocks are not aligned in a grid but rather seem to be floating with spaces between them. They do not touch each other; instead, they give the impression of varying distances being apart, which adds to the sense of them being suspended. There is no clear pattern to the arrangement, and the spacing between them is not uniform.</p>
