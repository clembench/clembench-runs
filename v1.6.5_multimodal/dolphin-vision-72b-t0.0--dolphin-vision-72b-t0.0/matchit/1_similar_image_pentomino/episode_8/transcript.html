        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first.

        <p>DESCRIPTION:<br/>The image is a digital collage featuring four distinct pieces resembling puzzle pieces. Each piece is rendered in a solid color: a purple cross, a green zigzag, an orange square, and a pink square. These pieces are spread across the canvas without overlapping, set against a white background. The simplicity of the image is striking, with each piece clearly defined by its color and shape, and no text or additional embellishments present.</p>
