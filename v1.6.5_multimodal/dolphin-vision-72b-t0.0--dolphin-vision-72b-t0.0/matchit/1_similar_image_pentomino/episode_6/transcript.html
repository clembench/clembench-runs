        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image displays five Tetris-like game pieces composed of squares. Starting from the top, there&#x27;s a purple &quot;T&quot;-shaped piece, a green &quot;Z&quot;-shaped piece, a pink &quot;L&quot;-shaped piece, an orange &quot;I&quot;-shaped piece, and a yellow &quot;J&quot;-shaped piece. These shapes are distinct and commonly known from the Tetris game. The pieces are arranged side by side in a clear, white background with no additional patterns or text. The pieces are not touching each other and are evenly spaced, suggesting a non-competitive environment possibly intended for instructional or illustrative purposes.</p>
