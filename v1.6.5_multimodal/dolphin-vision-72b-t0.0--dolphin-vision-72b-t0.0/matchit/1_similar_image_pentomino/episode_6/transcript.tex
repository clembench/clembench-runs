	 DESCRIPTION: The image displays five Tetris-like game pieces composed of squares. Starting from the top, there's a purple "T"-shaped piece, a green "Z"-shaped piece, a pink "L"-shaped piece, an orange "I"-shaped piece, and a yellow "J"-shaped piece. These shapes are distinct and commonly known from the Tetris game. The pieces are arranged side by side in a clear, white background with no additional patterns or text. The pieces are not touching each other and are evenly spaced, suggesting a non-competitive environment possibly intended for instructional or illustrative purposes.
