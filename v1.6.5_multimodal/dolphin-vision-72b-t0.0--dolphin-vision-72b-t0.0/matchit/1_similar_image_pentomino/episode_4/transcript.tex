	 DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt The image is composed of a grid of pixel art, organized in eight horizontal and seven vertical rows. It is colored in a simple, bright palette with distinct shades. The overall composition is abstract, and the colors are distributed in a manner that does not naturally form any recognizable shapes or symbols. Without additional context, it's not possible to ascertain a specific pattern or message from the pixel art alone. If the other image has the same number of squares and the same color layout, despite different arrangement, they might be the same.

	 Your image contains six shapes, which are colored and filled with no outlines, resembling Tetris pieces. Considering this, my question is:\\ \tt QUESTION: Are the colors of the shapes in the image you describe consistent with the colors used in typical Tetris pieces, which are usually red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and white/orange?
