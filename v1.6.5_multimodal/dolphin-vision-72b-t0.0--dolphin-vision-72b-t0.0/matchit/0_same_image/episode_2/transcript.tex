	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a residential kitchen with light wood flooring and cream-colored walls adorned with floral wallpaper near the ceiling. The central feature is a white island with glass-paneled doors, equipped with an under-mounted sink and topped with granite. Stainless steel appliances, including a side-by-side refrigerator, are present. A chandelier with candle-style lights hangs above the island, and a round wooden table with metal-frame chairs is set in the corner. Natural light streams in from a window over the sink, while overhead lighting is provided by recessed lights. The kitchen is well-appointed and decorated with a few potted plants and a bowl of oranges.

	 DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt \\ \tt The kitchen is designed with a neutral color palette primarily consisting of whites and natural wood tones, accented by stainless steel kitchen appliances and a patterned wallpaper border. Two main chandeliers provide lighting, one with a white lampshade hanging over the island counter, which has a contrasting black top, and another black metal chandelier above the dining area. The presence of plants and a bowl of fruit introduce natural elements and pops of color to the space.

There is no visible technology or modern gadgets, suggesting a focus on classic kitchen functionality.
