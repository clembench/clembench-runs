They are both clad in dark wetsuits and each carries a surfboard that has distinctive colors: one board is predominantly red with a black edge, and the other has yellow and black patterns. They are walking towards the waves, with the sandy beach serving as the foreground, and the ocean as the backdrop where waves are visible. The overall color palette is muted with greys, browns, and the contrasting colors of the surfboards.
