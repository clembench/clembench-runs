        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions.

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image is a dynamic capture of a baseball game at the batter&#x27;s perspective. The main subject is a batter in a black and white uniform, swinging at a pitch. He wears the number 33, and his focus is intense. Behind him, the catcher and umpire are in classic positions behind home plate, emphasizing the action. The catcher&#x27;s gear is in primary colors red, white, and blue, while the umpire is in blue. The stadium lights suggest an evening game, underlining the seriousness of the sport. The field is well-lit, but the background is a blur, keeping the focus on the players.<br/><br/>Please provide your description, and afterward, we can compare images and ask the necessary questions.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>DESCRIPTION: A scene from a baseball game, possibly during a practice or an informal match, focusing on a batter preparing to hit the ball, a catcher in position, and the umpire behind them. The stands are sparsely populated with spectators, indicating a low-attendance event. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting it&#x27;s either early morning or late evening. The central character, in white with the number 10 on the back, is ready to swing at an incoming pitch.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>Based on the detailed description provided, there seems to be a discrepancy in the number on the back of the players&#x27; uniforms, with yours being number 33 and mine number 10. This difference could indicate that our images are not of the same event. However, to confirm this, I have a question regarding your image:<br/><br/>QUESTION: Is there a logo visible on the batter&#x27;s helmet or uniform that could be used to identify the team or location where the game is taking place?</p>
