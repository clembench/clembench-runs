Each block, although different in shape and color, shares the same pixelated texture, indicating that they may be part of the same set or theme.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: This image features a sequence of three L-shaped Tetris game piece icons arranged in close proximity. The Tetris pieces are in different colors: the first L is purple, the second is teal, and the third is pink. The Tetris pieces are set against a white background, indicating that they might be floating or superimposed elements. The pieces are stylized with their edges slightly rounded, giving them a modern, digital look. There is no interaction between the Tetris pieces, no text, and they are not positioned within any specific context or structure.</p>
