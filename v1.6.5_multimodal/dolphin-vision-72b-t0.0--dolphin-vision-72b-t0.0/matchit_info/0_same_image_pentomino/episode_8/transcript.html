        <p>DECISION: different images<br/><br/>Based on the similarities in the abstract nature and the Tetris-like shapes, the images may appear to be closely related. However, the absence of text or recognizable figures, the uniform color scheme, and the specific lack of curves or rounded edges in my image&#x27;s shapes suggest that they are not precisely the same. Thus, while they could be variants of a similar theme, the specific details that were highlighted—lack of text, no recognizable figures, uniform thickness, and absence of rounded edges—indicate that there are differences between the two images.</p>
