There is also a plus sign in purple and a pixelated figure that resembles an eye, colored in red and yellow. The letters and symbols are against a white background.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: This image shows two pixel-style Tetris game pieces. The top piece is a cross-like shape with a purple core and yellow arms. Beneath it, a straight line piece is colored green. Both are set against a white grid background, with the green-piece&#x27;s tail slanted upwards, and the pink piece slightly separate from the purple one. The overall color scheme is quite vibrant, with purple, green, orange, and yellow being the prominent colors.</p>
