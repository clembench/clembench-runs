It contains the letters "M" and "R" in green and purple, respectively, and the numeral "4" is filled with orange.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image shows two pixel-style Tetris game pieces. The top piece is a cross-like shape with a purple core and yellow arms. Beneath it, a straight line piece is colored green. Both are set against a white grid background, with the green-piece's tail slanted upwards, and the pink piece slightly separate from the purple one. The overall color scheme is quite vibrant, with purple, green, orange, and yellow being the prominent colors.

	 This is my DESCRIPTION:\\ \tt The image provided is a digital graphic consisting of blocky letters and symbols. It contains the letters "M" and "R" in green and purple, respectively, and the numeral "4" is filled with orange. There is also a plus sign in purple and a pixelated figure that resembles an eye, colored in red and yellow. The letters and symbols are against a white background. This image appears to be designed in a retro style, reminiscent of early video game imagery or pixel art.\\ \tt Now ask a question in order to find out new aspects of my image that may be different to your image. Start with "QUESTION:" and do not add anything else.

	 To clarify the details of your image and mine, I have a few questions:\\ \tt \\ \tt 1. Do both images contain only text and symbols or are there any geometric shapes?\\ \tt 2. Are there any overlapping components or are they all separate?\\ \tt 3. In terms of background, does our image both have the same solid color?
