The colors are applied to the squares with varying patterns—some squares are solidly filled with the color while others have a lighter hue or even white, suggesting different shades or levels of color intensity. The squares are uniform in size and neatly stacked to form a vertical color column.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a pixelated arrangement of colorful blocks, with each block representing a different letter. Notably, the blocks are designed to spell out the word "FLRT" with an additional incomplete 'T'. The colors used are vibrant and distinct, aiding in the clarity of the depicted text. The arrangement is on a white grid with no other objects or text, and all the elements are set against a white background.
