        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions. Now start your short image description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image shows a residential kitchen with a classic design, featuring white cabinetry with both open and closed sections for storage. A central island with glass-paneled cabinets offers additional counter and storage space, with seating visible on the right side of the island. The countertop is a light color, likely a light stone or laminate, complementing the white theme. Stainless steel appliances include an oven, range, and a double-door refrigerator with a water dispenser. A round wooden dining table sits to the right, accompanied by metal lattice-back chairs, and a bowl of fruit adorns the table. Three pendant lights hang above the island, and chandeliers provide additional lighting. The walls are painted in a crisp white, and there&#x27;s a patterned border above the counter level, suggesting a decorated and lived-in space.</p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image provided is of a kitchen interior. Key elements include white cabinetry with glass door panels, granite countertops, a center island with storage, stainless steel appliances including a refrigerator freezer column, and a chandelier. The setting is residential, with no visible technology or modern gadgets. The decor is traditional, with attention to symmetry and classic design elements. The photo is taken from a perspective that includes the main working areas of the kitchen as well as the breakfast area, allowing for a comprehensive view of the space.<br/><br/>Now, I am ready to listen to the description of the image that only you can see.</p>

        <p>Based on your description, it seems both images share a common classic design with white cabinetry, a central island, stainless steel appliances, and a similar breakfast area. To clarify any discrepancies or to confirm the identity of the images, I will ask: <br/><br/>QUESTION: Does the kitchen island in the image have a cabinet in the center on the side facing the viewer?</p>
