	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a beach setting with two surfers in wetsuits, both preparing to enter the water with calm waves in the background. They are standing on the wet sand facing the ocean, with boards at their sides. The lighting is soft and diffuse, indicating an overcast day or early evening. No distinctive landmarks are visible, so the specific beach is not identifiable. The surfers' actions and the ocean's state suggest a quiet, non-competitive surfing environment, perhaps outside of high tourist season or at a less crowded beach.

The one in the foreground, holding the yellow surfboard, is slightly to the left of the one holding the red surfboard. The spatial arrangement is straightforward, and there isn't any noticeable interaction between them beyond their shared activity and direction of gaze towards the ocean waves.

	 ANSWER: In the image I am referring to, the surfers are positioned closely together on the sand, both facing towards the ocean. The one in the foreground, holding the yellow surfboard, is slightly to the left of the one holding the red surfboard. The spatial arrangement is straightforward, and there isn't any noticeable interaction between them beyond their shared activity and direction of gaze towards the ocean waves.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt

	 DECISION: same image\\ \tt \\ \tt Considering the details provided, the image I described seems to match the one you are referring to. Both images feature two surfers in wetsuits on the beach, one with a red surfboard and the other with a yellow surfboard, positioned close to each other and facing the ocean waves. Since the specific details of action, color, and positioning align, the images are likely to be the same.
