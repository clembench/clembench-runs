	 ANSWER: The immediately noticeable items include a silver fork and knife, a can of what appears to be tomato sauce, a green bowl, and a yellow plastic object with a handle. I would categorize the items based on their size: the can, fork, and knife are smaller; the green bowl is medium-sized, and the yellow object appears to be the largest. In terms of purpose, the utensils are for dining, the bowl could be for serving or cooking, and the can's content suggests food preparation. The yellow object, with its handle and size, might be a kitchen tool or container.
