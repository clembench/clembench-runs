	 DESCRIPTION: The image consists of four abstract forms on a white background. Each form is distinct and has a unique color: a large green circle, a small orange square, a small pink cross, and a larger purple plus sign that connects to a horizontal rectangle. The forms are flat and two-dimensional, lacking shadows or depth. All the shapes are simple and iconic, with no additional details or textures. They are arranged without any overlap or connection, each in its own space.

The blocks are arranged in close proximity but do not seem to interact or overlap. This is a static image with no indication of movement or sequence.
