        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image consists of four abstract forms on a white background. Each form is distinct and has a unique color: a large green circle, a small orange square, a small pink cross, and a larger purple plus sign that connects to a horizontal rectangle. The forms are flat and two-dimensional, lacking shadows or depth. All the shapes are simple and iconic, with no additional details or textures. They are arranged without any overlap or connection, each in its own space.</p>
