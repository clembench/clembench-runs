Starting from the left, there is a vertical purple cross, then a horizontal turquoise cross, followed by a pink 'F' facing to the right, and finally a series of orange dots zigzagging in a diagonal pattern. Each element is distinct, with no overlap, and the overall effect is of a simple color contrast without any additional context or background.

	 ANSWER: The purple cross is vertical and has distinct, separate arms, which makes it quite tall. The turquoise cross is horizontal and has arms that are part of the same piece of line art, making them shorter but wider compared to the purple one. Although they share the same basic shape, their proportions are different; the purple cross is significantly taller, while the turquoise cross is wider.
