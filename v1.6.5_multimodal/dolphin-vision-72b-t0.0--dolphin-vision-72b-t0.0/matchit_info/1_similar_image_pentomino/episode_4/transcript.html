        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions. Now start your short image description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image is a simple, pixelated illustration in an abstract style. It features four individual shapes, each composed of smaller, square pixels. Starting from the left, the first element is a cross, with each arm colored in purple. To the right of the cross, there is a green square shape that resembles a letter &#x27;F&#x27; due to a missing square in the bottom right corner. Adjacent to the &#x27;F&#x27; is another purple shape, identical to the first cross in its design. The last shape on the right is a pink square with the lower half having a staircase-like structure subtracted from it, resulting in three squares being cut out from the bottom right side. The shapes are evenly spaced with a white background filling the rest of the space.</p>

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image consists of several letters designed in a pixel-art style. The letters are colored green, purple, and pink. There&#x27;s a &#x27;H&#x27; in green, followed by a plus sign in purple, then an &#x27;F&#x27; in green, and followed by a &#x27;P&#x27; in pink.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image consists of a collection of distinct pixel art shapes. From the left, there is a purple cross, following which a green square with a &#x27;U&#x27; shape created by a black line is present. The third shape is another purple cross, identical to the first. Lastly, there is a pink square with a descending staircase-like line subtracted from its bottom side.
