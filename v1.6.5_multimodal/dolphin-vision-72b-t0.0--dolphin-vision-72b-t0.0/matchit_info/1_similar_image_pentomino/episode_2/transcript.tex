	 DESCRIPTION: The image displays four colorful pixelated shapes. It consists of three crosses and one plus sign, each with a solid fill and distinct colors: green, purple, and salmon. The crosses are slightly tilted to the left, while the plus sign aligns horizontally. There is some variation in the shapes of the crosses, notably the salmon-colored cross which appears to be a 'T' shape rather than an 'X'. The image does not contain any text or additional elements and is set against a neutral background. The design is simplistic and does not include shading or three-dimensionality.
