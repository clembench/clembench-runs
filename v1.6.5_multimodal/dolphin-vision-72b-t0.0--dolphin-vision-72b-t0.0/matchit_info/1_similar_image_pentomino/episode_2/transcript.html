        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image displays four colorful pixelated shapes. It consists of three crosses and one plus sign, each with a solid fill and distinct colors: green, purple, and salmon. The crosses are slightly tilted to the left, while the plus sign aligns horizontally. There is some variation in the shapes of the crosses, notably the salmon-colored cross which appears to be a &#x27;T&#x27; shape rather than an &#x27;X&#x27;. The image does not contain any text or additional elements and is set against a neutral background. The design is simplistic and does not include shading or three-dimensionality.</p>
