	 You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.\\ \tt The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.\\ \tt Please describe your image first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the images to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions. Now start your short image description with "DESCRIPTION:" followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

	 The image can be described as follows: A casual outdoor gathering of cyclists in a park, identifiable by numerous bicycles scattered throughout the background. The scene is relaxed, with people seated on the grass engaging in conversation or relaxing after a bike ride. The greenery of the park and the scattered bikes suggest a leisurely activity possibly following a cycling event or a group hike. There are no overt signs of distress or disarray, indicating a likely informal and peaceful setting. The colors are natural and muted, with bright but not harsh sunlight casting a warm glow on the scene.\\ \tt \\ \tt Your turn to provide your image description.
