The helmet is black with a gold emblem, and he is using a black bat. The catcher and umpire are behind him, both in profile with the batter; the catcher is crouched with a mitt out, and the umpire is squatting in position to call the pitch. The lighting suggests an evening game, which is underscored by the artificial lighting of the stadium. The stands in the background are not visible, but the field is well-maintained. This description is focused on what is visible to ensure an accurate comparison with the other picture.

	 DESCRIPTION: This image is a photograph of a street corner featuring a red, octagonal stop sign that is sticker-filled. The sign is positioned at an intersection, with a "no entry" sign visible to the left and buildings in the background, indicating an urban environment. A pedestrian is captured in motion on the sidewalk, and there are vehicles parked along the street. Details such as the weather, time of day, and the specific text or symbols on the stickers on the stop sign are not discernible from this image.

	 I have to know whether or not it's the same picture as my picture, so I'll be asking questions to reveal any potential differences. Your image seems to be of a baseball game at night, focusing specifically on a batter, a catcher, and an umpire. Since my image is a daytime urban street scene, can you confirm the following aspects about your image to ensure they differ from mine? \\ \tt \\ \tt QUESTION: Are there any buildings, streets, or stop signs visible in your image?
