        <p>ANSWER: In the image provided, the shapes are arranged in a single, straight diagonal line. Starting from the left, there is an isolated purple square. Next to it, there&#x27;s a pair of a green square and a small orange square, followed by an orange square. Further to the right, there is a pink square positioned adjacent to the orange square. Finally, the rightmost position is occupied by a pink square that aligns with the leftmost purple square, creating a diagonal line across the image.</p>
