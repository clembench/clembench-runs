    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>ANSWER: The plus sign is positioned between the letters &quot;K&quot; and the incomplete &quot;Z,&quot; appearing slightly tilted to the left. It is not aligned with any baseline; rather, it seems to be at the midway point between the &quot;E&quot; and the &quot;T&quot; below it, creating a visual connection that ties the upper and lower halves of the composition together.</p>

    <div speaker="Player 1 to Game Master" class="msg a-gm">
        <p>Given your description of the Tetris-like blocks, they lack any form of connection or linking element such as a plus sign between them. Therefore, my question is:<br/><br/>QUESTION: How are the Tetris-like blocks presented in terms of interaction? Are they in a grid-like structure that suggests gameplay, or are they floating or static in a non-playable arrangement?</p>
