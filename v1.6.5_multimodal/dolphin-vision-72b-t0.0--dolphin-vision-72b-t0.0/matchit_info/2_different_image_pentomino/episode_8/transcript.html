        <p>Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?

    </div>

    <div speaker="Player 2 to Game Master" class="msg b-gm">
        <p>DECISION: different images<br/>The images described in the game are different. The main indicators for this decision are the color and arrangement of the blocks. The color green in the other picture is not present in my description, nor are the red and purple colors. Additionally, the arrangement of the blocks in my description does not match the patternless scattering described in the other picture. Furthermore, there is no yellow cross in my description, which is a significant element in the other image. Therefore, based on these discrepancies, we can conclude that the two images are not the same.</p>
