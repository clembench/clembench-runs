	 DESCRIPTION: The image showcases a collection of differently shaped, pixelated blocks in a variety of colors. There are red, yellow, and purple blocks arranged randomly against a white background. The shapes include rectangles, squares, and what appear to be simple 'T' and 'L' shapes, possibly suggesting elements from a Tetris-like game. The blocks are not interlocking and do not seem to form any specific pattern or complete structure.\\ \tt \\ \tt Now, it's your turn to describe the image only you can see. After descriptions are provided, we can proceed with the collaborative guessing game as per the guidelines.
