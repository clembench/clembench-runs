Please give your answer in the following format: \n'{\"action\":\"<action>\", \"description\": \"<room description>\", \"graph\": <graph>}'.\n<action> needs to be in the format \"GO: <direction>\" where <direction> is one of [north, east, south, west]. Alternatively, choose \"DONE\" as your action once you have explored the entire map.\n<room description> should be a single sentence describing the room shown to you.\n<graph> represents the map in this format: {\"nodes\":[], \"edges\":{\"north\": [], \"south\": [], \"east\": [], \"west\": []}}\nOmit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\n\nHere is an example: \nWe are in this room.
