Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there.

Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with \"GO: DIRECTION\" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with \"DONE\".
