On the right, there is a pink "P" shaped block above a pink "T" shaped block. The background is white, and the blocks are not aligned in a way that would occur in an actual game of Tetris; they are scattered.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image appears to be a pixelated representation of objects or possibly letters with no discernible background. There are several clusters of pixels with different colors. On the left, there is a cluster that resembles a cross or a plus sign in purple, followed by a horizontal arrangement of green pixels that could be interpreted as a series of steps or a jagged line. Below this, there is a separate, smaller cluster of orange pixels forming a similar jagged line pattern. On the right side of the image, there is a pink pixel cluster that looks like a letter 'P' and below it, another pink cluster forming what could be a 'T' or a hammer-like shape. The image has a very abstract, low-resolution aesthetic.
