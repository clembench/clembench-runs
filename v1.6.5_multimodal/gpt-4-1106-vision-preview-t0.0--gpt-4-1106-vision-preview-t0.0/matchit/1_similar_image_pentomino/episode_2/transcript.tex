	 DESCRIPTION: The image contains a collection of pixelated shapes in various colors. There are four distinct shapes, each a different color: purple, green, pink, and orange. Each shape resembles a Tetris block configuration. The purple shape is a "T" shape, the green is an "S" or "Z" shape, the pink is another "T" shape but in a lighter shade, and the orange is an "L" shape. The background is white, and the shapes do not touch each other.
