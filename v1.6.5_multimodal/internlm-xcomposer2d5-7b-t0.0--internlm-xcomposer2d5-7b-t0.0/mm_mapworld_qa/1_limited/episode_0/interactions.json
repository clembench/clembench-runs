It is designed for an infant, featuring a crib as the central piece of furniture. The walls are painted in a light color with an orange stripe running horizontally midway, adding a pop of color to the room. There is a green armchair to the left of the crib, providing a comfortable seating area for parents or caregivers. On the right side of the crib, there is a small table with a toy on it, likely for the child's entertainment. The room is well-lit, with two spherical lamps hanging above the crib. The floor is covered with an orange rug that matches the stripe on the wall, creating a cohesive color scheme.
