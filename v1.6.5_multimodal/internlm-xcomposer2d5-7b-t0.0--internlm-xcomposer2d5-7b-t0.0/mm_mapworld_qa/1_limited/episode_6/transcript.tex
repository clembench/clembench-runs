	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the provided image and the context of the task, we are currently in a room that appears to be a hallway or a corridor. The room is characterized by a light-colored wall, a wooden floor, and a framed picture hanging on the wall. There are doors on either side of the hallway, suggesting that this is a residential or office building. To proceed with the task, we need to describe the room we are in and choose where to go from there. Given the options of north, south, east, or west, and considering the layout visible in the image, the next instruction would be to move towards the door on the right side of the hallway. Therefore, the next instruction is:\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a hallway with doors on either side and a framed picture on the wall.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt This action implies moving towards the door on the right side of the hallway.
