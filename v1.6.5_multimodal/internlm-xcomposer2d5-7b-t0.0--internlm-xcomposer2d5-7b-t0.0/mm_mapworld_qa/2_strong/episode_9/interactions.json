The room is characterized by blue tiles on the walls and a shower area with a glass door. There is a white bathtub to the left with a blue towel hanging over its edge. The floor is tiled in a warm, earthy tone, and there is a small window above the bathtub that offers a glimpse of greenery outside. From this room, we have the option to go north or south.
