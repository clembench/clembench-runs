	 DESCRIPTION: The image is a photograph of a bathroom. It features a white toilet positioned to the left of the frame, with a closed lid. Above the toilet, there is a window with white blinds partially open, allowing sunlight to filter into the room. The walls are painted in a light beige color, and the floor appears to be tiled. There is a towel rack on the wall to the right of the toilet, but no towel is hanging from it. The bathroom door is slightly ajar on the right side of the image, revealing a glimpse of the hallway outside.
