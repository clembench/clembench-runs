        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this picture and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your image first.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image depicts an adult elephant and a calf standing on a grassy terrain. The adult elephant is large, with a long trunk and tusks, and its skin is textured and wrinkled. The calf is smaller, with smoother skin and a shorter trunk. There is a clear distinction in size between the two, indicating an adult and a juvenile. The environment appears to be a natural habitat, possibly a savannah or a grassland, with sparse vegetation and a clear sky above. There are no other animals or people in the image, and the focus is solely on the two elephants.</p>
