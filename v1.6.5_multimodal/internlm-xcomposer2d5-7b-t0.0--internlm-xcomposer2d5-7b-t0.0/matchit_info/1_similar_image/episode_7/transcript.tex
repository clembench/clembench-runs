The calf is smaller, with smoother skin and a shorter trunk. There is a clear distinction in size between the two, indicating an adult and a juvenile. The environment appears to be a natural habitat, possibly a savannah or a grassland, with sparse vegetation and a clear sky above. There are no other animals or people in the image, and the focus is solely on the two elephants.
