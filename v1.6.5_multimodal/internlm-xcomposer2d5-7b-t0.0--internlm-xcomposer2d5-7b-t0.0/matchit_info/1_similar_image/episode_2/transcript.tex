In the background, other individuals are either skiing or snowboarding, with some standing still, possibly taking a break. The snow appears to be well-trodden, indicating a popular skiing area. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be a cold day. There are no distinct landmarks or buildings visible, which gives the impression of a natural, possibly remote, skiing location.
