	 DESCRIPTION: The image depicts an outdoor market scene with a focus on a fruit stall. The stall is laden with various fruits, predominantly bananas, which are hung in bunches above the counter. The bananas are yellow, indicating they are ripe. Below the bananas, there are green leafy vegetables neatly arranged in crates. A person is present behind the stall, possibly the vendor, wearing a red apron over a patterned shirt. In the foreground, there is another person, likely a customer, wearing a pink top and carrying a brown handbag. The setting suggests a casual, everyday environment, typical of a local market.
