Some sheep have distinctive patches of color on their wool, while others have more uniformly colored coats. These variations are typical of sheep and can be indicative of different breeds or individual characteristics. There are no discernible patterns such as stripes or geometric shapes on the wool; instead, the markings appear more random and natural.

	 ANSWER: Yes, there are sheep in the image that are noticeably larger or smaller than the others. The variation in size could be due to differences in age, breed, or perspective. Some sheep appear to be fully grown adults, while others seem to be younger or smaller in stature. The perspective of the image may also contribute to the perception of size differences, as some sheep are positioned closer to the camera, making them appear larger.

	 ANSWER: All the sheep in the image are standing. There are no sheep that are lying down. The sheep are positioned in a way that suggests they are either grazing or resting while standing, which is typical behavior for sheep in a pastoral setting.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
