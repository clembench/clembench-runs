To its left, there are two picture frames with abstract designs, and to the right, there are two vases, one clear and one purple. In front of the handbag, there is a small wooden bowl with a patterned design, and to the right of the vases, there appears to be a small notebook or journal. The setting seems to be indoors, possibly in a shop or a personal collection area, given the presence of shelving and other items in the background.
