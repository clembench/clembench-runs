	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a bathroom.\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east.

	 We are in a meticulously organized walk-in closet. From this vantage point, we can proceed in various directions to explore other sections of the closet or potentially exit to an adjoining room. Since the target room is a restroom, and we are currently in a closet, the next instruction would be to move towards the area where the restroom is likely to be located. However, without a clear indication of the restroom's position from the current perspective, I cannot provide a specific direction to take. If we assume the restroom is adjacent to the closet, the next instruction could be "GO: east" or "GO: south," depending on the layout of the space. If the restroom is directly accessible from the closet, the instruction would be "DONE."
