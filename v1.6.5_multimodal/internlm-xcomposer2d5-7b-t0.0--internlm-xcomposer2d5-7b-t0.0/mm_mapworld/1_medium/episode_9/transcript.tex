	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a living room. It is furnished with a beige sofa adorned with multiple cushions, a coffee table holding a stack of magazines, and a side table with a lamp. The walls are decorated with patterned wallpaper, and there is a mirror hanging above the side table. The room is well-lit with natural light coming from a window dressed with beige curtains. There is also a French door on the right side of the room leading to another part of the house. From this room, we can proceed to the next room by going through the French door. Therefore, the next instruction is: "GO: through the French door".
