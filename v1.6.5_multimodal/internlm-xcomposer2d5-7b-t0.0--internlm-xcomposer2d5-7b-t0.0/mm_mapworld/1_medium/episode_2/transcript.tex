	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a child's playroom. It is designed to be colorful and engaging, with a variety of toys and educational materials arranged neatly on shelves and in bins. The television is turned on, suggesting that the child might have been watching a show before taking a break to lie down on the couch. From this room, we have the option to go west, which might lead us to another room in the house. However, without additional context or information about the layout of the house, it is difficult to determine the best course of action. Therefore, based on the available information, the next instruction would be to proceed to the next room by going west. If there are no more rooms to visit, we should conclude the exploration. Here is the format for the next instruction:\\ \tt ```json\\ \tt {\\ \tt   "description": "We are in a child's playroom with a variety of toys and educational materials arranged neatly on shelves and in bins. A television is turned on, and a child is lying on a couch in front of it. We have the option to go west from this room. What is the next instruction?"\\ \tt   "action": "GO: west"\\ \tt }\\ \tt ```
