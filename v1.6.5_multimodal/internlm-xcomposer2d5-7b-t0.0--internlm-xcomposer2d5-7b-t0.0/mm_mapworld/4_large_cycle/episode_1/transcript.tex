	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom", "action": "DONE"}\\ \tt Let us start. \\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the image provided, we are currently in a room that appears to be part of a larger structure, possibly a facility or a series of connected rooms. The room has a simple, functional design with white walls and a sloped roof, suggesting it might be located in a temperate climate where snow or rain could be a consideration in the design. There is no furniture or other distinguishing features visible in the image, so I cannot provide a more specific description of the room.\\ \tt \\ \tt To proceed with the task, I will choose a direction to move in based on the available options: north, south, east, or west. Given the layout of the rooms in the image, I will go east as it seems to be the most logical choice to continue exploring the facility without repeating rooms.\\ \tt \\ \tt Next instruction: GO: east.
