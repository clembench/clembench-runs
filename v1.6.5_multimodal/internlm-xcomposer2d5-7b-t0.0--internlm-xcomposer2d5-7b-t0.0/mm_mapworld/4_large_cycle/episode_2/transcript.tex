	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a child's playroom. It is designed for a young child, evidenced by the colorful and educational toys arranged neatly on the wooden shelf. The room is also personalized with photographs on the wall, suggesting it is a cherished space for the child. The television is turned on, indicating that the child might have been watching a show before taking a break. Given the context, the next instruction would be to decide where to go from here. Since there are no new rooms to visit and we are at the end of the exploration, the appropriate action to take would be to stop the exploration. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\\ \tt ```json\\ \tt {\\ \tt   "description": "We are in a child's playroom with a television and a wooden shelf filled with colorful toys. A child is resting on a blue couch, watching a show on the television. The room is decorated with photographs on the wall, creating a warm and personal atmosphere. There are no new rooms to visit, and we have completed our exploration of the space. It is time to stop the exploration. ",\\ \tt   "action": "DONE"\\ \tt }\\ \tt ```
