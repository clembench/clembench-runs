	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 We are in a bathroom with blue tiles on the walls and a white pedestal sink. There is a mirror above the sink, and a towel is hanging on the wall to the left. To the right of the sink, there is a shower area with a blue curtain. The floor has black and white checkered tiles. Based on the available directions, the next instruction would be to explore the room further. However, since this is a bathroom and there are no visible doorways or other rooms to enter, we can conclude that there are no new rooms to visit. Therefore, the next instruction would be to stop the exploration. \\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom with blue tiles on the walls and a white pedestal sink.
