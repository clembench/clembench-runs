It is designed with a soft and soothing color palette, predominantly featuring shades of pink and white. The crib is the central piece of furniture, adorned with pink blankets and pillows. Above the crib, there are three white picture frames, but they are currently empty. To the left of the crib, there is a small white dresser with a lamp on top. The room also has a large window dressed with pink and white curtains, allowing natural light to fill the space. The carpet is a light pink, and the walls are decorated with a delicate pink floral pattern. There is no indication of any other rooms to visit from this nursery.
