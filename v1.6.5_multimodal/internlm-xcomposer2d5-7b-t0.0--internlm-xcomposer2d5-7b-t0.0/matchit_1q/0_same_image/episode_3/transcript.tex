On his head, he has a black hat with a wide brim, and he is wearing sunglasses. The man appears to be holding a string with a small object attached to it, which could be a kite. The background is slightly blurred, but it seems to be an outdoor event with other people present. The sky is clear, and the lighting suggests it is daytime.
