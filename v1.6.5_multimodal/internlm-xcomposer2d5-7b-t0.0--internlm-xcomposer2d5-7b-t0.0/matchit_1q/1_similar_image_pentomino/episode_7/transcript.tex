There are no discernible objects or figures; instead, the composition is made up of geometric forms that appear to be randomly placed. The shapes include squares, rectangles, and what seems to be a cross-like figure. The colors are solid and bright, with no gradients or shading. The background is plain white, providing a stark contrast to the colored shapes. There is no indication of movement or action within the image.
