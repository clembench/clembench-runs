The dog's fur is multi-colored, predominantly brown and black, with some white patches. It appears to be a small to medium-sized breed, possibly a terrier or a mixed breed with similar characteristics. The dog's expression is one of curiosity or attentiveness, as it seems to be looking intently at something outside the window.\\ \tt \\ \tt Referring Expression: "Multi-colored dog with brown and black fur, resting its head on a windowsill, looking outside with a curious expression."
