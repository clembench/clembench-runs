The pizza has a golden-brown crust with visible char marks, indicating it may have been baked in a wood-fired oven. The cheese is melted and bubbly, with patches of tomato sauce peeking through. Fresh basil leaves are scattered on top, adding a touch of green to the otherwise red and white palette. The background is dimly lit, focusing the viewer's attention on the pizza.
