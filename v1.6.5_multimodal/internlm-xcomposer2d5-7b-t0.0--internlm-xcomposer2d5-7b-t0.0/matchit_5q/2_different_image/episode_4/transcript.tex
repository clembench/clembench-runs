He is positioned next to a sign that reads "The LORD JESUS CHRIST WILL RETURN Please READ Revelation 21:7-8." The man appears to be holding onto a metal object, possibly a part of a cart or a personal belonging. He is wearing a light-colored shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes. In the background, there are other individuals who are not the focus of the image. The environment suggests a public space, such as a city sidewalk or plaza.

The background shows a clear sky and some trees, indicating an outdoor setting. There are no other objects or people in the immediate vicinity of the locomotive, focusing the viewer's attention on the train itself.
