        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image is a black and white photograph depicting an elderly man sitting on a bench in an urban setting. He is positioned next to a sign that reads &quot;The LORD JESUS CHRIST WILL RETURN Please READ Revelation 21:7-8.&quot; The man appears to be holding onto a metal object, possibly a part of a cart or a personal belonging. He is wearing a light-colored shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes. In the background, there are other individuals who are not the focus of the image.
