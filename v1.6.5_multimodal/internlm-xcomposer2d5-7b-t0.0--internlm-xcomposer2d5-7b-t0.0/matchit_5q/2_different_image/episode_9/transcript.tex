The countertops appear to be made of a light-colored stone or composite material. The kitchen is well-lit, with natural light coming in from the windows. The flooring is wooden, and there is a decorative chandelier hanging above the island. The walls are painted in a light color, providing a bright and airy feel to the space. There are no people or personal items visible in the image, giving it a clean and uncluttered appearance.
