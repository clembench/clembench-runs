Adjacent to it, on the right, stands a classical building with a green dome and a clock, reminiscent of neoclassical architecture. The street is bustling with traffic, including cars and a distinctive double-decker bus, which is often associated with cities like Dublin. The lighting suggests it is either dawn or dusk, giving the scene a soft glow.

The scene is set against the backdrop of a stadium filled with spectators. The focus of the image is on the dynamic interaction between the batter, the ball, and the catcher.
