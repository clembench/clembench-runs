	 ANSWER: The color palette of my image is dominated by the whites and blues of the snow and sky, creating a cold and serene atmosphere. The yellow and red of the fire hydrant add a pop of color to the otherwise monochromatic landscape, drawing the viewer's eye and providing a focal point. The light brown of the dog's fur contrasts with the snow, adding warmth and life to the scene.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
