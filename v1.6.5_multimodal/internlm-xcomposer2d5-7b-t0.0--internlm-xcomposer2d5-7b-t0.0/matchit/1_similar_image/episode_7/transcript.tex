	 ANSWER: In my image, both the adult and the calf are standing upright. This is consistent with the posture of the elephants in the image you described, with no notable differences.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
