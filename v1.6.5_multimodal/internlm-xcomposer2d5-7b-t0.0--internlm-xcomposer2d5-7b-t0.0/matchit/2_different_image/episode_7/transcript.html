        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image depicts an outdoor market scene with a focus on a fruit vendor. The vendor is standing behind a table laden with various fruits, predominantly bananas, which are hung in bunches above the table. The vendor is wearing a red apron over a patterned shirt. In the foreground, there is a customer, an elderly woman, walking past the table. She is dressed in a purple jacket and carries a pink shoulder bag. The market appears to be well-stocked with fresh produce, and the atmosphere suggests a typical day of commerce in a local market.</p>
