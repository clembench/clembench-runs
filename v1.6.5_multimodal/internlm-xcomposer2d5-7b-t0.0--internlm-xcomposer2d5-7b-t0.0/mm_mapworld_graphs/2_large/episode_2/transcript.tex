	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible.  In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Additionally, you need to provide a graph representing the map you have uncovered. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: \\ \tt '{"action":"<action>", "description": "<room description>", "graph": <graph>}'.\\ \tt <action> needs to be in the format "GO: <direction>" where <direction> is one of [north, east, south, west]. Alternatively, choose "DONE" as your action once you have explored the entire map.\\ \tt <room description> should be a single sentence describing the room shown to you.\\ \tt <graph> represents the map in this format: {"nodes":[], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}}\\ \tt Omit any other text and answer only following the format, not adding anything except the dictionary!\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example: \\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: south, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"action":"GO: north", "description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "graph":{"nodes":["Kitchen"], "edges":{"north": [], "south": [], "east": [], "west": []}}}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the image provided, it appears that we are in a room with a vintage-style wooden desk and an iMac computer on it. The room has a minimalist design with a plain white wall and a light-colored wooden floor. There are no visible doors or windows, and the room seems to be designed for work or study, given the presence of the computer.\\ \tt \\ \tt To proceed with the task, we need to explore the room and determine the available directions. Since the image only shows one side of the room, we can only confirm the presence of a door on the left side of the desk. Therefore, the current available directions are north and east.\\ \tt \\ \tt Given this information, the next instruction would be to explore the room in the direction of the door, which is to the left side of the desk. This would involve moving towards the left side of the desk and looking for any other exits or points of interest in that direction.\\ \tt \\ \tt Therefore, the next instruction is:\\ \tt "GO: left."\\ \tt \\ \tt This action will allow us to gather more information about the room and update the graph accordingly.
